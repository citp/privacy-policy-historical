      <h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
      <p>At Farmers, we are committed to protecting your                                   privacy.  Please read on for more                                   details about our privacy policy.</p>
      <h2>What information do we collect? How do we use it?</h2>
      <p>If you want to receive personalised emails of news and other                                   matters which may interest you, you have the option to choose to receive them                                   and to give us an indication of your interests. We may also use the information                                   we collect to occasionally notify you about new Farmers services and special offers from Farmers and Farmers Card that we think you'll find                                   valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, you may opt out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email that we send to you. <br>
        <br>
        When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so,                                   customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be                                   asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then                                   be used by us and by any company offering the contest or promotion to notify                                   winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. <br>
        <br>
        In addition, when we team up another company to offer or provide products,                                   services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference                                   our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company                                   may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities                                   and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations. <br>
        <br>
        If, prior to participating in a contest or promotion, you opted not to receive                                   information about or mailings from us, you may still receive information from                                   or about Farmers in connection with the contest or promotion if you choose to                                   register for or participate in it. You may opt not to participate in these                                   contests or promotions if you do not want to receive information about Farmers                                   or share your information with Farmers and the other companies sponsoring those                                   contests or promotions. <br>
        <br>
        The use of your personal information collected, while applying for a Farmers                                   Card, can be found within the terms and conditions listed on the Farmers Card                                   application. <br>
        <br>
        We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the                                   design and layout of the site. Any information automatically retrieved, such as                                   site browsing patterns, will be used only in aggregate form (so that no                                   individual visitors are identified).</p>
      <h2><strong>How does Farmers protect customer information?</strong></h2>
      <p>When you  complete an online application,                                   we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts                                   all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, as required by                                   the Privacy Act 1993, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and                                   disclosure of information, which you have given us, to prevent unauthorized                                   access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of                                   identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you. <br>
        <br>
        To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner                                   of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key                                   or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also                                   double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a                                   secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http"                                   to "https."</p>
      <h2><strong>Will Farmers disclose the information it                                     collects to outside parties?</strong></h2>
      <p>Farmers does not sell, trade or rent your personal                                   information to others. Farmers may provide aggregate statistics about our                                   customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable                                   third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally                                   identifying information. <br>
        <br>
        We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.                                   Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail                                   and e-mails, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing                                   data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and                                   providing customer services. Such companies and individuals will have access to                                   personal information needed to perform these functions, but may not use it for                                   any other purposes and are required to process the data in accordance with the                                   Privacy Act 1993. <br>
        <br>
        The use of your personal information collected, while applying for a Farmers                                   Card, can be found within the terms and conditions listed on the Farmers Card                                   application.</p>
      <h2><strong>What about links to other websites and services?</strong></h2>
      <p>The Farmers website may contain links to other sites that                                   are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding                                   privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. We have                                   no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for                                   the convenience and information of our visitors.</p>
      <h2><strong>Your consent</strong></h2>
      <p>By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information                                     by Farmers. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those                                     changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we                                     collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
      <h2><strong>In summary</strong></h2>
      <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the                                   information we collect on the site to                                    enhance your overall Farmers experience. We do not sell, trade or rent your                                   personal information to others. If you would rather not receive any announcements or special offers from us, you may opt out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email that we send to you. </p>
