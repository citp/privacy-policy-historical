		<p>Thank you for visiting FareCompare. FareCompare values your privacy and appreciate your use of our services. FareCompare employs best practices and all reasonable efforts to protect its registered and unregistered users’ information.</p>
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<p>For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes your IP location to enhance your website experience.</p>
<p>We collect aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, limited user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations.</p>
<p>1. Unregistered users</p>
<p>If you do not register when you visit FareCompare, the information we collect from you is limited to your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and track usage statistics. All information we collect from unregistered users and is used only in aggregate and used to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors.</p>
<p>We also use “cookies” and/or similar technology to enhance user experience. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it contains no personally identifiable information that would allow us to identify you. Cookies cannot be used to read data off of your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other Web sites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors use our site, and to help us to improve our site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting not only our Web site, but other Web sites as well.</p>
<p>If you visit our site from a site operated by one of our partners, and you have registered with that partner limited information about you that you have provided to that partner may be transmitted to us. You should review the privacy policy of the Web site from which you reached our site in order to determine what information was collected and how you agreed that our partner could use that information.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Registered users</p>
<p>Registering with FareCompare provides users additional features, including email correspondence.</p>
<p>When you register, personal information we may collect includes your name, email address, travel preferences, user name and password. The information we collect may vary, but we only collect the information that you manually enter into our forms or otherwise authorize us to collect. We may store all or some of that information in a cookie your experience may be customized on FareCompare.</p>
<p>If you visit our site from a site operated by one of our partners, and you have registered with that partner limited information about you that you have provided to that partner may be transmitted to us. You should review the privacy policy of the Web site from which you reached our site in order to determine what information was collected and how you agreed that our partner could use that information.</p>
<p>If you log in to our When-to-Fly<sup>SM</sup> Twitter application using your Twitter credentials, we may re-publish the content you have made available on Twitter (including but limited to, tweets, handle name, following/followed stats, public profile information) (collectively, “Twitter Account Content”). To ensure we have your permission to use your Twitter Account Content as contemplated herein we require your agreement to these terms and conditions governing your access to, contribution to and use of the When-to-Fly Twitter application. You therefore grant us permission, free-of-charge, using only your then current Twitter handle as attribution to you, to obtain, publish, republish, advertise, promote and/or store a copy of your Twitter Account Content on the When-to-Fly Twitter application, our other mobile or website properties, and/or in other third party online, mobile or print advertising, marketing and media outlets.</p>
<h3>How we use your information</h3>
<p>The information collected from registered and unregistered users is used to provide you with a relevant experience while visiting FareCompare, as well as to deliver relevant information to you via email and other contact points you provide to FareCompare.</p>
<p>After registering, if you decide you do not want to receive e-mail from us you can easily unsubscribe from email by following instructions provided in each email correspondence we send.</p>
<p>From time to time, we make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies or organizations, please let us know by or unsubscribing from email from FareCompare.</p>

If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.</p>
<p>Third Party Advertising</p>
<p>We allow selected third parties to advertise their goods and services on our website.  These third parties may use one or more methods, including “cookies,” to collect limited information regarding your visit to our site.  This limited information may included your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash® installed.  The information gathered will not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number.  Third parties generally use this information for geographic or preference targeting, such as showing California ads to someone in California or showing ads for particular goods or services to someone who frequents particular types of websites.  If you would like more information about this practice, third party cookies, or your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
<h3>Your user preferences</h3>
<p>Registered users can update your email preferences by clicking the update profile link in the footer of email we send. Registered users can also visit <a href="http://www.farecompare.com/mytrips">http://www.farecompare.com/mytrips</a> to manage advanced preferences.</p>
<h3>How we help protect your user information</h3>
<p>FareCompare has security features to help protect the personal information we collect. For example, we limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also employ processes (such as password hashing, login auditing, and idle session termination) to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information. But please know that there is no way for us to guarantee the security of your personal information.</p>
<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>This website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.</p>
<h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change this policy should we deem it advisable to do so. If we make material changes that will affect personal information we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and to give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your registration.</p>
