<p>Please note that we do not knowingly collect, keep or maintain personal information from children under the age of 18 through the Online Services, as we require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Information We Collect Through Your Use of the Moby websites</em></p>
<p>When you use any Moby Online Services, we may collect personal information (i.e. information that could be used to contact you directly such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address; “Personal Information”) and demographic information (i.e. information that you submit, or that we collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not limited to, post code, hometown, gender, username, device information, including the type of mobile device you use, a unique device identifier (for example, your device's IMEI number, the MAC address of the device's wireless network interface, or the mobile phone number used by the device), mobile network information, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile browser you use, time zone setting, device location, IP address, SMS data, transaction information, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration history information) (“Demographic Information” and, together with Personal Information, “Personal Data”).</p>

Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your Personal Data in accordance with this privacy policy. By submitting your Personal Data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>To preserve the integrity of our databases, to carry out on-going Online Services on your behalf, for research, analytics and statistics purposes and to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we retain Personal Information and Demographic Information submitted by Users for a reasonable length of time. Moby is not responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide, and will modify or update your Personal Information in our databases upon your request. If required by law or at your request, we will erase or archive from active use your Personal Information. By accessing or using the Online Services, you do hereby represent and warrant that you understand that all information submitted by you through the Online Services or otherwise to Moby may be used by Moby in accordance with applicable laws and this privacy policy.</p>

Moby has staff dedicated to maintaining our privacy policy as set forth herein and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing Web security and making sure that every Moby employee is aware of our security practices.
