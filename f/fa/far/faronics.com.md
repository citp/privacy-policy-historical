# Faronics Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT**

Faronics respects the privacy of our online visitors and recognizes the importance of providing a secure environment for them; we have made every effort to provide this.

Faronics may require you to provide us with personal information if you would like to participate in some activities on, or benefit from services offered on, our website. We have made every attempt to limit our personal information requirements to only that information which we believe is necessary to fulfill a visitor’s request.

Personal information collected on this website is often limited to e-mail addresses and job titles, but we may ask for additional information when needed to provide a requested service. For example, if you choose a service or transaction that requires payment, such as making a purchase on Faronics’ online store, we will request personal information necessary for billing and/or shipping such as name, address, telephone number and credit card number. Faronics does not collect personal information from site visitors unless it is intentionally provided.

Any information provided by visitors to our website will be used for internal purposes only. Personal user data entered on the Faronics site will not be sold, released, or made available to any third party outside of Faronics. This information is collected with the sole purpose of meeting the needs of our customers, to answer questions from visitors, and to provide information and services to these visitors.

Please note that when you link to other sites from the Faronics.com site, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those other sites.
