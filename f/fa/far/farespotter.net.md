### IP Addresses

The Company uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, customize the Site to meet our users' needs, and help diagnose problems with our servers. The Company will not use your IP address to locate or identify any personal identifiable information about you. IP addresses are also used to gather broad demographic information and to prevent, investigate, and take actions in the case of suspected fraud or abuse.

### Web Tracking and Analytics

The Company tracks and analyzes visitor activity through cookies, log files, and pixels, so that we may better understand how our users make use of the Site and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, and so that we may better tailor content to meet our users' needs. This data may include referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords, JavaScript enablement and individual user click behavior. However, no personally identifiable information is used in connection with this analysis of visitor activity. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data that a web server places on a user's computer. The Company employs the use of cookies to ensure, for example, that you do not see repetitions of the same ad, to estimate and report audience size and traffic, and to customize and personalize your experience at the Site. Any reporting of audience size and traffic is not linked to personally identifiable information.

Some Company advertisers use pixels to track the effectiveness of the promotions they run on the Site. Such pixels may lead to cookies being placed on your computer by these advertisers. The Company does not have control over these 3rd party cookies, and cannot access any personally identifiable information about you as a result of these cookies.

Furthermore, the Site may, from time to time, use outside media companies to display advertisements on our site. These ads may contain cookies, which are collected and tracked by the outside media company. The Company has no access to or control over these cookies.

Most web browsers provide users the ability to limit the use of cookies by allowing users to adjust privacy settings. If a user has their cookies disabled, the Site will still be accessible, however some sections of the web site may not perform as well as they normally would with cookies enabled.

### Emails and Unsubscribe Policy

In the future, in order to customize your experience with our email newsletters, we may receive a confirmation when you open email from us, if your computer supports such capabilities. Clicking on a link in our newsletters may also be tracked on a per user basis to allow us to present content, which closely matches your interests. Demographic and profile data (such as state, zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize your experience at our site or in our email newsletters, showing you content and advertising that may best suit your needs. This information is shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis only. Individual user click behavior is never shared with advertisers and partners.
