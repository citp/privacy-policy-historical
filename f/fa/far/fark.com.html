<h4>
<span id="Fark's_Privacy_Policy"></span><span id="Fark.27s_Privacy_Policy">Fark's Privacy Policy</span>
</h4>
<p><b>Short Version</b>
</p>
<p>We will not give your addresses to third parties. We hate spammers. Bunch of jackasses is what they are.
</p>
<p><b>Longer Official Version</b>
</p>
<p>Fark is committed to user privacy in our products and services. This policy outlines our personal information handling practices. If you give us personal information, we will treat it according to this policy.
</p>
<p>Fark encourages you to read this privacy policy and those of all web sites you visit. Below is a summary of Fark's online privacy policy.
</p>
<p><b>Types and uses of personal information</b>
</p>
<p>Your personal information is used in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>User IDs and Passwords. Provides you with access to your profile areas and to protected content.</li>
<li>Account Information. These tell us more about who you are, how to contact you, and your shipping and billing information.</li>
<li>Customer Feedback and Support. Provides a mechanism for requesting information from Fark. Also used to tell us how we can improve our products, services and site designs.</li>
<li>Email Correspondence. Used to raise and respond to issues and inquiries of all types. Also used to distribute information about Fark, our products, and services.</li>
<li>Transactions. Shows which products and services you have requested.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will only use your personal information in the ways specified when it was collected. We will not subsequently change the way in which we use your personal information unless you consent to the new usage.
</p>
<p><b>Security measures</b>
</p>
<p>We protect the personal information you share with us.
</p>
<p>Authorized third party agents may also need access to some of your personal information. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We only provide third party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested service or transaction. We do not otherwise share your personal information with third parties unless you have granted us permission to do so.
</p>
<p><b>Data Retention</b>
</p>
<p>Fark will not retain your personal information longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
</p>
<p><b>Linked web sites</b>
</p>
<p>We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control these Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) third party sites.
</p>
<p><b>Children's privacy</b>
</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems.
</p>
<p>Fark encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc</li>
<li>Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.</li>
<li>Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the FTC's site(1) for more tips on protecting children's privacy online.
</p>
<p>We may display advertisements from third parties. Third party ad-serving companies control which ads are shown. These ad-serving companies may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information from you. Advertisers use this information to target the ads and measure their impact.
</p>
<p><b>Third Party Advertising</b>
</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. For more information on online behavioral advertising, privacy, cookies, and how this all works, please see the <a rel="nofollow" target="_top" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/learn_more.asp">Network Advertising Initiative</a> page on this topic.
</p>
<p><b>Third Party Cookies</b>
</p>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser. 
</p>
<p>You can opt-out of Google Adsense advertising cookies by going to <a rel="nofollow" target="_top" href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences">http://www.google.com/ads/preferences</a>.
</p>
<p>You can opt-out of other third-party advertising cookies by using the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out tool at <a rel="nofollow" target="_top" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Audience Analytics</b>
</p>
<p>In order to understand our audience, and understand how our audience interacts with Fark, we use a few different analytics products.  Each of these places a cookie on your computer to gather information about the Fark pages you visit, how long you stay on the site, etc.  
</p>
<p>This information is aggregated so we can see general patterns.  None of the information you provide on sign-up or while using the site is ever provided.  
</p>
<div id="google_uid">
<p>One of these analytics products is Google Analytics.  We send the Fark Account Number assigned to you at sign-up time to Google Analytics to understand how our users use Fark across different devices.  Google has no way to associate this with any other personally identifiable information inside of Analytics.  If you don't want us to send your Fark Account Number to Google Analytics, you can check the box in your <a rel="nofollow" target="_top" href="https://www.fark.com/users/0/prefs">Preferences</a> that says "Don't send my Fark Account Number to Google Analyics".
</p>
</div>
<p><b>Policy updates</b>
</p>
<p>All updates to this policy will be posted here.
</p>
<p>Note: This policy also covers the personal information you provide to Fark Customer Support.
