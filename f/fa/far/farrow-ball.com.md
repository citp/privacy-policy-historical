# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies even if you have purchased via a third party (such as a stockist, trade book holder or professional contractor) where we dispatch your Farrow & Ball goods on their behalf.

Farrow & Ball is committed to protecting your privacy and takes its responsibilities regarding the security of customer information very seriously. This privacy policy explains what personal data we collect about you, how and why we use it, who we disclose it to, and how we protect your privacy.

#### 1\. Who is responsible for your data

Our Privacy Policy applies to the personal data that Farrow & Ball collects and uses.

References in this Privacy Policy to “Farrow & Ball”, “we”, “us” or “our” mean Farrow & Ball Limited (a company registered in England and Wales with registration no 00999927 and registered office at 33 Uddens Trading Estate, Wimborne, Dorset, BH21 7NL). We control the ways your personal data are collected and the purposes for which your personal data are used by Farrow & Ball and are the “data controller” for the purposes of the UK Data Protection Act 2018, EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), PCI-DSS, and European data protection legislation.

We also comply with the principles of the US Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 USC §2510) and the Canadian Privacy Act and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) although our data is processed and hosted within the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales.

Farrow & Ball Limited is registered on the ICO Data Protection Register; Registration Number Z3256296 – Expr August 2019

#### 2\. Purpose and lawful basis for processing your data

We have two purposes for processing your personal data:

• To sell our products to you and carry out any logistics for delivery or return of goods

This purpose allows Farrow & Ball to lawfully process your data for legitimate interests (GDPR 6F) and our legal obligations to your country’s tax and revenue authorities.

• To determine the mix of new and existing customers

As a business backed by private equity investment, we need to monitor our rates of attraction, conversion and retention of customers to provide a measure business performance. Your email address is used to build an anonymised report with no ability for F&B staff or shareholders to determine the individuals included in the statistics. Inclusion in this reporting does not mean you will receive any marketing, inspiration or event communications unless you have given consent separately.

• To inform, inspire and engage with you about our brilliant colours, products and services

This purpose allows Farrow & Ball to seek your consent to process your data for communication, education and marketing purposes (GDPR 1). Without your explicit consent, Farrow & Ball will not process your data for this purpose.

The purpose and lawful basis for processing your data may change from time to time, where this policy will be updated.

#### 3\. Consent

Your consent will be an explicit action from 25th May 2018. Because of the need for consent we will not use defaulted opt-in checkboxes or include your personal data for communication and marketing purposes where you have asked only for a transactional email (receipts, proof of delivery etc…).

We will keep your given consent on file for a period of up to 7 years from the last change before checking if your consent is still valid. This is in line with our average customer project cycle. We will not contact you if you have withdrawn consent, but you can grant or withdraw your consent at any time by visiting your contact preference centre at www.farrow-ball.com.

At 7 years we will write to you by email or post, depending on your preferences, with a statement of consent and your current choices. We will then send a reminder email after 30 days if no contact has been received. If this is not responded to then we will take that your granting of consent is still valid.

We will also include the opportunity to unsubscribe or withdraw consent on all marketing emails.

#### 4\. Personal data we collect about you

When using the term “personal data” in our Privacy Policy, we mean information that relates to you and allows us to identify you, either directly or in combination with other information that we may hold.

If you are using our mobile app, we may also send you app notifications for these purposes.

Please be aware that these communications are not made for marketing purposes and as such, you will continue to receive them even if you opt-out from receiving marketing communications.

We will also use your personal data if we contact you after you have sent us a request, filled in a web-form through our website or contacted us on social media.

Your opinion is very important to us, so we may send you an email or SMS to seek your feedback.

You can also request us to send you marketing communications through managing your preferences in your account.

If you are happy to receive marketing communications, we will provide you with news from us such as new products that you may be interested in or services that you may like.

In addition, if you are happy to receive marketing communications, we may send you communications promoting our partners’ products and services that may be related with your purchase history.

If you have questions in relation to your personal data, please contact us at: [data.protection@farrow-ball.com](mailto:data.protection@farrow-ball.com).

#### 7\. Right to be forgotten

You have a right to be forgotten and have data erased and / or stop being processed where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose of collection, you withdraw consent, when you object to the processing or to comply with a legal obligation.

What we will undertake is to anonymise your records, overwriting your personal data with fictional names, addresses and emails. Once this has been done it will be impossible to restore a single customer, and a new customer registration will be required.

We have a number of security and governance protections in place that will be excluded from your right to be forgotten:

**• Encrypted system backups, held for up to 10 years.** It is practically impossible to alter these backup files

#### 8\. Right to restrict processing

You have a right for your personal data to be stored but not processed. This is achieved through the withdrawal of consent.

#### 9\. Rights related to automated decision making including profiling

You have a right to be excluded from automated decision making. Farrow & Ball have a number of different customer and consumer types who we personalise experiences for. These include home decorators, interior designers, professional painter and decorators, stockist owners and more. Our personalisation of your experience is achieved through automating profiling based on purchase behaviours and information shared.

You can select your preference at our [contact preference centre](https://www.pages02.net/farrowandball/preference-centre-en/), but opting out of this, you will not be able to receive any personalised inspiration or communications.

This software does not enable us to collect any personal data. In addition, in order to understand how our customers interact with the emails and the content that we send, we use pixels that allow us to know if the emails we send are opened or if the content of our emails is displayed in text or html form.
