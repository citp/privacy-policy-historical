    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    <h2><br>
    We Respect Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy. For that reason, we have developed this privacy
      policy statement to help you understand what information we gather online
      and what we do with that information.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to review the privacy
      policy statement. If you have any questions or comments about it, please
      contact us using the information provided below.</p>
    <h2><br>
    1. Information We Gather </h2>
    <p>We believe it is important for you to know how we use and treat the information
      we receive and collect about you through this site.</p>
    <p>In general, you can visit Blain's Farm &amp; Fleet on the World Wide Web
      without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about
      yourself. We do keep track of the pages viewed by each visitor, but none
      of the information we collect identifies you personally. Instead, our web
      server automatically collects some information about you when you request
      pages from our server, including your IP address, which is a number that
      is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer
      so that data (such as the web page you request) can be sent to you. We
      aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other visitors to
      track overall visitor traffic patterns. We use this information to improve
      our site by making it more responsive to the needs and preferences of our
      users. We may provide aggregate statistics to reputable parties about the
      visitors to our site, but these statistics will not include any personal
      or private information that identifies you.</p>
    <p>Blain's Farm &amp; Fleet collects
      personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, email addresses
      and the like, only when voluntarily provided by a visitor to the site. We
      collect information when you register online, update your account, log-in,
      place orders, opt-in to receive emails, shop online, and participate in
      contests, promotions or surveys. You can choose not to provide certain
      information, but you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.</p>
    <h2><br>
    2. How We Use Your Information.</h2>
    <p>We use the information you provide for purposes such as responding
        to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our
        store, providing you with discounts and special offers through mail and
    email, and communicating with you.</p>
    <p>When an order is placed on our
      website, we keep a record of this information to process the order, track
      shipments and contact you via email, postal mail, or by telephone if
      we encounter any questions or issues with your order. You may also receive
    order confirmations and status emails from us.</p>
    <p>You should be aware that Blain's
      Farm  &amp; Fleet will disclose specific
        information about you if it is required to do so by law, governmental
request, process or court order if a good faith belief exists that compliance
is necessary to conform or comply with the law.</p>
    <p>If you would like to remove your name from Blain's Farm &amp; Fleet's
      mail or email lists, please contact our Customer Support Team using the
      information found in paragraph 8 below. We do not sell or rent any of your
      personally identifiable information to third parties.</p>
    <h2><br>
    3. Cookies </h2>
    <p>A technology called "cookies" is used on certain pages of our site. A
      cookie is a tiny element of data that a site can send to your browser,
      which may then be stored on your hard drive so the site can recognize you
      when you return. You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive
      a cookie or to refuse cookies altogether. Should you decide not to accept
      cookies from the site, however, you may limit the functionality we can
      provide when you visit the site.</p>
    <h2><br>
    4. Collection of personal data from children </h2>
    <p>Blain's Farm &amp; Fleet is concerned about the privacy of children
        and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. We
        intend to sell our products only to adults. If you are under
        18, you may use farmandfleet.com only under the supervision of a parent
        or guardian.</p>
    <h2><br>
    5. Links to other sites </h2>
    <p>Our site may include links to other sites as a convenience to you. The
      inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of any other company,
      its site(s), or its product(s) and/or service(s). Blain Supply, Inc. and
      the Blain's Farm &amp; Fleet corporations are not responsible for the privacy
      practices or content of any other site.</p>
    <h2><br>
    6. Security</h2>
    <p>We take our customer's business seriously and take measures to make
      sure the Blain's Farm &amp; Fleet shopping experience is safe. We use Secure
      Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to keep your private information and credit
      card information as secure as possible. While we implement these and other
      security measures, please note that complete security is not always possible. </p>
    <h2><br>
    7. Changes to this privacy policy</h2>
    <p>By using our site, you agree to the terms of the privacy policy in effect
      at that time. Because our site will continue to implement new technologies
      and improve the services and features we provide, this policy is subject
      to change without prior notice. We encourage you to review the policy periodically
      for that reason. In no event will we use information you submit under the
      current privacy notice in a new way without first providing you an opportunity
      to prevent that use. If you choose to visit farmandfleet.com, your
      use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and Blain's
      Farm &amp; Fleet's Legal Notice, including any limitations on damages,
      disputes, and choice of law. If you have any concerns about this Policy,
      please email customerservice@farmandfleet.com with a description of your
      concerns and a member of our Customer Support Team will contact you.</p>
    <h2><br>
    8. Contact us. </h2>
    <p>We want to reiterate that we are dedicated to protecting your privacy.
      Should you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy
      policy, please contact us at 608.754.2821 or customerservice@farmandfleet.com.</p>
    <p>By writing us at: Blain Supply, Inc., P.O. Box 391, Janesville, WI 53547-0391.
      Please be sure to include your email address and phone number with any
