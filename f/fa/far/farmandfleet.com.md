When an order is placed on our website, we keep a record of this information to process the order, track shipments and contact you via email, postal mail, or by telephone if we encounter any questions or issues with your order. You may also receive order confirmations and status emails from us.

We use service providers to offer financial products, such as Blain's Farm & Fleet credit card. We may share personal information about our consumers with these service providers in order to provide you with tailored information about products and services and special offers. These service providers also have their own privacy statements that set out how they collect, use and disclose personal information.

### Do We Share the Information We Collect?

We do not rent or sell your PII to marketers outside of the Blain's Farm & Fleet business, except as indicated in this Privacy Policy or unless you tell us to do so.

We may provide aggregate statistics to reputable parties about the visitors to our site, but these statistics will not include any personal or private information that identifies you.

You should be aware that we will disclose specific information about you if it is required to do so by law, governmental request, process or court order if a good faith belief exists that compliance is necessary to conform or comply with the law.

There may be instances when we may use or disclose your PII in order to protect or defend the legal rights, property or operations of Blain's Farm & Fleet or our employees or agents; to protect the rights, privacy, safety or security of users, members or others; to protect against fraud; and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

### Security

We take our customer's business seriously and take reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural measures to make sure the Blain's Farm & Fleet shopping experience is safe. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to keep your PII and credit card information as secure as possible. SSL technology causes your browser to encrypt your order information before transmitting it to our secure server. SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our websites from capturing and viewing your personal information.

While we implement these and other security measures to protect your privacy, please note that 100% effective security is not always possible and we cannot be responsible for the actions of those who may gain access to your PII.

### Links to Other Sites

Our site may include links to other sites as a convenience to you. If you click on one of those links you will be taken to websites we do not control. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of any other company, its site(s), or its product(s) and/or service(s). Blain Supply, Inc. and the Blain's Farm & Fleet corporations are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any other site.

### Collection of Personal Data from Children

Blain's Farm & Fleet is concerned about the privacy of children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. We intend to sell our products only to adults. If you are under 18, you may use farmandfleet.com only under the supervision of a parent or guardian.

### Customer Control Over Personally Identifiable Information

Depending upon the type of browser you use, you may have the ability to control cookies. You should consult your browser settings in order to reject cookies and click here to control flash cookies.

### Visitors from the European Union

To comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personalization features are disabled if you are visiting this site from countries in the European Union. IP geolocation and cookies are used to ascertain the origin of your visit to the site, and are used to control the functionality of these features.
