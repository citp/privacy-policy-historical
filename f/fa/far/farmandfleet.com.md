# Blain's Farm and Fleet : Privacy Statement

  
We respect your privacy. For that reason, we have developed this privacy policy statement to help you understand what information we gather online and what we do with that information.

We encourage you to review the privacy policy statement. If you have any questions or comments about it, please contact us using the information given below.

  
We believe it is important for you to know how we use and treat the information we receive and collect about you through this site.

In general, you can visit Blain’s Farm & Fleet stores on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We do keep track of the pages viewed by each visitor, but none of the information we collect identifies you personally. Instead, our web server automatically collects some information about you when you request pages from our server, including your IP address, which is a number that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web page you request) can be sent to you. We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other visitors to track overall visitor traffic patterns. We use this information to improve our site by making it more responsive to the needs and preferences of our users. We may provide aggregate statistics to reputable parties about the visitors to our site, but these statistics will not include any personal or private information that identifies you. Blain’s Farm & Fleet collects personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, email addresses and the like, only when voluntarily provided by a visitor to the site. We will notify you as to the uses we intend to make of that information if and when you provide such information to us. 

  
A technology called “cookies” is used on certain pages of our site. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so the site can recognize you when you return. Our cookies do not contain any personal identifying information. You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to refuse cookies altogether. Should you decide not to accept cookies from the site, however, you may limit the functionality we can provide when you visit the site. 

  
We do not collect personally identifiable information from any visitor to the site, including children. 

  
Our site may include links to other sites as a convenience to you. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of any other company, its site(s), or its product(s) and/or service(s). Blain Supply, Inc. and the Farm & Fleet corporations are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any other site. 

  
By using our site, you agree to the terms of the privacy policy in effect at that time. Because our site will continue to implement new technologies and improve the services and features we provide, this policy is subject to change without prior notice. We encourage you to review the policy periodically for that reason. In no event will we use information you submit under the current privacy notice in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to prevent that use. 

  
We want to reiterate that we are dedicated to protecting your privacy. Should you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at 608.754.2821.

By writing us at: Blain Supply, Inc., P.O. Box 391, Janesville, WI 53547-0391. Please be sure to include your email address and phone number with any correspondence you may send us so that we will be able to respond to you.

Effective November 27, 2002
