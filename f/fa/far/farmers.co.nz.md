# Farmers Trading Company of New Zealand

At Farmers, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**   
When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and the card's expiry date. This allows us to process and fulfil your orders and to notify you of the status of your order. 

We also ask for your telephone number, which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order. For some deliveries this number may be given to our couriers. 

We also ask whether you want to receive personalised emails of news, and other matters, which may interest you. You have the option to choose to receive them and to give us an indication of your interests. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new Farmers services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, you may opt out by sending us an email to 

[contactus@farmers.co.nz](mailto:contactus@farmers.co.nz)

When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and by any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. 

In addition, when we team up another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations. 

If, prior to participating in a contest or promotion, you opted not to receive information about or mailings from us, you may still receive information from or about Farmers in connection with the contest or promotion if you choose to register for or participate in it. You may opt not to participate in these contests or promotions if you do not want to receive information about Farmers or share your information with Farmers and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions. 

The use of your personal information collected, while applying for a Farmers Card, can be found within the terms and conditions listed on the Farmers Card application.

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site. Any information automatically retrieved, such as site browsing patterns, will be used only in aggregate form (so that no individual visitors are identified). 

**How does Farmers protect customer information?**   
When you place orders or complete an online application, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, as required by the Privacy Act 1993, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information, which you have given us, to prevent unauthorized access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

To check the security of your connection, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 

**Will Farmers disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**   
Farmers does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. Farmers may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer services. Such companies and individuals will have access to personal information needed to perform these functions, but may not use it for any other purposes and are required to process the data in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993. 

The use of your personal information collected, while applying for a Farmers Card, can be found within the terms and conditions listed on the Farmers Card application. 

**What about links to other websites and services?**   
The Farmers website may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites have their own policies regarding privacy. You should review those policies before visiting the websites. We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. 

**In summary**  
We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on the site to make shopping at Farmers possible and to enhance your overall shopping experience. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. If you would rather not receive any announcements or special offers from us, you may opt out by visiting your sending us an email to [contactus@farmers.co.nz](mailto:contactus@farmers.co.nz)

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Farmers. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.
