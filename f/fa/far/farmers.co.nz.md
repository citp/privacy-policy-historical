At Farmers, we are committed to protecting your privacy. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

## What information do we collect? How do we use it?

If you have opted-in to receiving promotional information from Farmers, from time to time, we may e-mail you information about products and services which may be of interest to you. If you no longer wish to receive marketing emails from us, you may opt out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send to you. Click here to [manage your Farmers email preferences](http://farmersclub.co.nz/preferences).

When we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and by any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. 

In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations. 

If, prior to participating in a contest or promotion, you opted not to receive information about or mailings from us, you may still receive information from or about Farmers in connection with the contest or promotion if you choose to register for or participate in it. You may opt not to participate in these contests or promotions if you do not want to receive information about Farmers or share your information with Farmers and the other companies sponsoring those contests or promotions. 

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site. Any information automatically retrieved, such as site browsing patterns, will be used only in aggregate form (so that no individual visitors are identified).

## **How does Farmers protect customer information?**

As required by the Privacy Act 1993, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information, which you have given us, to prevent unauthorized access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.   


## **Will Farmers disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

Farmers does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. Farmers may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

Farmers complies fully with the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007. We will not share, sell, rent, swap or authorise any third party to use your e-mail address without your permission. If you feel you have received an e-mail from us in error, please contact [contactus@farmers.co.nz](mailto:contactus@farmers.co.nz). 

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer services. Such companies and individuals will have access to personal information needed to perform these functions, but may not use it for any other purposes and are required to process the data in accordance with the Privacy Act 1993. 

## **What about links to other websites and services?**

The Farmers website may contain links to other sites that are not under our control. These websites may have their own policies regarding privacy, you should review those policies. We have no responsibility for linked websites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.

## **Your consent**

By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Farmers. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.

## **In summary**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect on the site to enhance your overall Farmers experience. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. If you would rather not receive any marketing emails from us, you may opt out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send to you.
