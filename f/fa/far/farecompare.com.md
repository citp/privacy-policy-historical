All information we collect from unregistered users and is used only in aggregate and used to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors.

We also use “cookies” and/or similar technology to enhance user experience. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it contains no personally identifiable information that would allow us to identify you. Cookies cannot be used to read data off of your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other Web sites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors use our site, and to help us to improve our site. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting not only our Web site, but other Web sites as well.

Third Party Advertising

We allow selected third parties to advertise their goods and services on our website. These third parties may use one or more methods, including “cookies,” to collect limited information regarding your visit to our site. This limited information may include your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash® installed. The information gathered will not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number. Third parties generally use this information for geographic or preference targeting, such as showing California ads to someone in California or showing ads for particular goods or services to someone who frequents particular types of websites.

### Your user preferences

Registered users can update your email preferences by clicking the update profile link in the footer of email we send.

### How we help protect your user information

FareCompare has security features to help protect the personal information we collect. For example, we limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also employ processes (such as password hashing, login auditing, and idle session termination) to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information. But please know that there is no way for us to guarantee the security of your personal information.

### Children’s Privacy

This website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.

### Changes to our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to change this policy should we deem it advisable to do so. If we make material changes that will affect personal information we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and to give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your registration.
