 **Use of Cookies and Similar Technology**

We use “cookies” and/or similar technology to help you log in, personalize content and ads, to provide social media features, to analyze our traffic, and to enhance user experience.

Session ID tracking| This is a proprietary cookie that allows us to understand what actions took place throughout the session.  
UTM Tags for attribution| Since we work with advertisers to give you all available prices for an itinerary, we have to be able to attribute that action to an individual partner. We are not collecting personal data, just a click as part of our basic business function.

### How we use your Information

The information collected from registered and unregistered users is used to provide you with a relevant experience while visiting FareCompare, as well as to deliver relevant information to you via email and other contact points you provide to FareCompare.

 **Email Communications**  
The information we collect on about you, and/or which you consent to allow us to use, is in part used to send you targeted emails, through a third party vendor, with content related to your travel interests, such as:  
– Flight prices and other information for the trip you have signed up to watch, including related deals such as hotels and rental cars for that trip  
– Targeted deals from your preferred home city  
– Recommended flights based on previous search history  
– Travel advice relevant to your home city

We track and analyze email behavior, such as opens and clicks, to:  
– Determine overall email performance  
– Decide who should be sent emails  
– Track performance of offers provided by our partners, for billing purposes

We share information about your use of our Website with our social media, advertising, and analytics partners, who may combine it with other information that you’ve provided to them or that they’ve collected from your use of their services. Such information is not personally identifiable.  
The Web Site may contain links to other websites and online services. When you link to such other sites and services (including by means of clicking on hyperlinks, logos, widgets, banners or advertisements), you become subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party websites. We encourage you to be aware of this when you click on a link and leave the Web Site, and to read the privacy policies of every website that collects Personal Information from you.

With your permission, we may share your information with our marketing partners and other third parties so that they may contact you directly regarding special promotions or offers. If you have consented to share your Personal Information with third parties for such third parties’ marketing purposes, you can change your mind at any time and may let us know by changing your user preferences.  
You are only sent emails for which you have provided consent, and you can unsubscribe or manage your email preferences at any time here.

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to consent to or decline such new uses, as required by law. We will only use your personal data as authorized by law. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically.

 **Third Party Advertising**

We allow selected third parties to advertise their goods and services on our website to better enhance your experience. These third parties may use one or more methods, including “cookies,” to collect limited information regarding your visit to our site. This limited information may include your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash® installed. The information gathered will not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number. Third parties generally use this information for geographic or preference targeting, such as showing California ads to someone in California or showing ads for particular goods or services to someone who frequents particular types of websites. You have the option as to whether or not you choose to view this advertising by clicking on the applicable third party’s ad. If you would like more information about this practice, third-party cookies, or your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

 **Your User Preferences**  
Registered users can update email preferences by clicking the update profile link in the footer of email we send. If you would like to delete your profile, you can do so by going to Account Settings.

 **How we help protect your user information**  
FareCompare has security features to help protect the personal information we collect. For example, we limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also employ processes (such as password hashing, login auditing, and idle session termination) to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information. 

**Children’s Privacy**  
This website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.

 **Changes to our Privacy Policy**  
We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will notify you of material changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing such changes. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website. Any changes to our practices will not change our commitment to honor privacy in accordance with all applicable laws.
