# Privacy Policy - Farmers Insurance

### Privacy Policy

If you are a customer of Farmers, you have already received this notice. If you are not a customer, this notice provides you with information about Farmers' privacy practices. Please note that the sections below, "Your choice" and "Recipient of this Notice," do not apply to farmers.com users who are not Farmers' customers. If you become a customer, you will receive a copy of this notice and the opportunity to advise us of your choice regarding Farmers' use of certain information. 

In the course of our business relationship with you, we collect information about you that is necessary to provide you with our products and services. We treat this information as confidential and recognize the importance of protecting it. We value your confidence in us. 

This notice from the member companies of the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies® listed below ("Farmers'") describes our privacy practices regarding information about our customers and former customers that obtain financial products or services from us for personal, family, or household purposes. 

**How We Protect Your Information**

At Farmers, our customers are our most valued assets. Protecting your privacy is important to us. We restrict access to personal information about you to those individuals, such as our employees and agents, who provide you with our products and services. We require those individuals to whom we permit access to your customer information to protect it and keep it confidential. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable regulatory standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. 

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you, as our customer or former customer, except as described in this notice. 

**Information We Collect**

We collect and maintain information about you to provide you with the coverage, product or service you request and to service your account. 

We collect certain information ("nonpublic personal information") about you and the members of your household ("you") from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your social security number, assets, income, and property information; 
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others, such as your policy coverage, premiums, and payment history; 
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency or insurance support organization, such as motor vehicle records, credit report information and claims history; and 
  * If you obtain a life, long-term care or disability product, information we receive from you, medical professionals who have provided care to you and insurance support organizations, regarding your health.



**Information We Disclose**

We may disclose the nonpublic personal information we collect about you, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements and to other third parties, all as permitted by law. 

Many employers, benefit plans or plan sponsors restrict the information that can be shared about their employees or members by companies that provide them with products or services. If you have a relationship with Farmers or one of its affiliates as a result of products or services provided through an employer, benefit plan or plan sponsor, we will abide by the privacy restrictions imposed by that organization. 

We are permitted to disclose personal health information (1) to process your transaction with us, for instance, to determine eligibility for coverage, to process claims or to prevent fraud; (2) with your written authorization, and (3) otherwise as permitted by law. 

**Sharing Information with Affiliates**

The Farmers family encompasses various affiliates that offer a variety of financial products and services in addition to insurance. Sharing information enables our affiliates to offer you a more complete range of products and services. 

We may disclose nonpublic personal information, as described above in Information We Collect, to our affiliates, which include: 

  * Financial service providers such as insurance companies and reciprocals, investment companies, underwriters and brokers/dealers; and 
  * Non-financial service providers, such as management companies, attorneys-in-fact and billing companies.



We are permitted by law to share with our affiliates our transaction and experience information with you. 

In addition, we may share with our affiliates consumer report information, such as information from credit reports and certain application information that we have received from you and from third parties, such as consumer reporting agencies and insurance support organizations. 

**Your Choice**

If you prefer that we not share consumer report information with our affiliates, except as otherwise permitted by law, you may direct us not to do so by following the procedure explained in the Opt Out Form you will be receiving. We will, however, remain able to share with our affiliates information about our transactions and experiences with you, as well as identification information, such as your name and address. 

If you do not opt out now but later decide that you do not want us to share consumer report information with our affiliates, except as otherwise permitted by law, you may notify us at any time by completing the Opt Out Form. We will implement your request within a reasonable time after we receive the completed form. 

You may opt out only by completing the Opt Out Form. You may request additional copies by sending us a request at the address shown on the form. An additional Opt Out Form will be mailed to you shortly after receipt of your request. 

If it is your decision not to opt out and to allow sharing of your information, you do not need to complete the Opt Out Form or respond to us in any way. 

**Modifications to our Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to change our privacy practices in the future, which may include sharing nonpublic personal information about you with nonaffiliated third parties. Before we do that, we will provide you with a revised privacy notice and give you the opportunity to opt out of that type of information sharing.
