Marketing and Business Development

Occasionally we may use Personal Information to send you details of new services, updates, and invites to events.

Our marketing communications will also include an “unsubscribe” link.

Transfer of Assets

If all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information (including your Personal Information), would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any assets, including your Personal Information, may continue to be used as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

 **SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION**

We do not provide Personal Information to any unaffiliated parties or third parties, except in certain circumstances as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

To provide and administer the sales of our products and services on our Website, we may need to share your Personal Information with our partners and different service providers or suppliers that we work with. This does not adversely affect your rights. We will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure transferred information is kept secure as required by applicable data privacy laws.

We may disclose ‘blind’ aggregated data and user statistics to prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. Blind data is data which does not identify an individual person or disclose Personal Information. We may also disclose Personal Information with your consent or at your direction. 

Please be advised that in certain circumstances, FAO Schwarz may be required to disclose your Personal Information to governmental organizations, attorneys and private agencies that conduct relevant criminal and civil investigations, or otherwise as required by our legal obligations.

 **COOKIES**

As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, many websites use cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies to allow faster and easier access to your account information, monitor traffic on the Website, and measure traffic patterns to improve functionality of the Website. Our web pages may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifts) or other advanced technologies that are useful in the provision of services to you, permitting us, for example, to counter users who have visited those pages and for other related Website statistics. We may also use such devices to verify compliance with our terms and conditions of use or with any promotions on the Website.

If you do not want FAO Schwarz to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie in your browser software. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use of some of the services and functionalities at our Website.

 **WEBSITE TRAFFIC**

We may track domain names, IP addresses, browser types, resolution, etc. from people who visit our Website. We use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout the Website. Such information is not correlated with any Personal Information.

As previously stated, FAO Schwarz may also use cookies to track your visit to our Site. While our web servers may automatically log your IP address, this information will not be used to identify you and you remain anonymous.

 **SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES**

The Website may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button and the Twitter “Follow” button), which let you share actions you take on the Website with other media. The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the privacy settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. You use these social sharing features at your own risk. No security measures, including the privacy settings referenced above, are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot and do not guarantee that the information you share using such features will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.

 **SECURITY**

FAO Schwarz uses commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your information with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. Likewise, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers and make sure you use a secure browser. The Website uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where Personal Information is required. To make purchases from the Website, you must use an SSL-enabled browser, such as +. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet. We may update browser requirements from time to time by posting a notice on the Website.

Remember to sign out of your FAO Schwarz account and close your browser window when you have finished your work to ensure that others cannot access your account by using your computer when you are away from it. Because of the global nature of the Internet, when you give us information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Except as discussed above or otherwise designated, the Website does not use security encryption measures. Therefore, information that you disclose by use of the Website (as with any website that is non-secure), by posting a message or using e-mail, potentially could be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties or use of such information by third parties for their own purposes, legal or illegal. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our services, and you do so at your own risk.

 **THIRD PARTY WEBSITES**

The Website may contain links to third party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external services that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Website, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information and Personal Information. Before visiting and providing any information to any third party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information and Personal Information. We are not responsible for the content, privacy, security practices, or policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Website.

 **CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13**

FAO Schwarz does not knowingly solicit Personal Information from children or send them requests for Personal Information. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on this Website or on or through any of its features. If we learn we have collected or received Personal Information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.

 **CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of FAO Schwarz who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us electronically at privacy@FAO.com or write to us at the address set forth below.

 **PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**

FAO Schwarz reserves the right to amend, alter, or otherwise change this Privacy Policy at our sole and absolute discretion. If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will notify all users via email, and may specifically ask you to agree to the modified terms in order to continue using the Website. Otherwise, further use of the Website following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review the Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the Personal Information we collect.
