  * We may collect any information you enter, share or that can be obtained from your use of our apps, games, contests, or promotions.



You have the choice to tell us not to collect and use this information. For more information, including how you can opt out, click here: About Toys"R"Us Advertising

We operate cameras in our Retail Stores for security and operational purposes. Except for security and loss-prevention purposes, we do not use these cameras to identify you personally. 

_Combined Information._

Information you provide at our Retail Stores may be combined with information that you provide online at Toys"R"Us Sites, as well as with information about your product interests and purchases we collect automatically. The information you provide to Toys"R"Us may also be combined with demographic and other information that is available from other sources in order to allow Toys"R"Us to better communicate with you and enhance our customer service and your shopping experience.

_Do Not Track_

Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, Toys"R"Us and the Toys"R"Us Sites do not recognize DNT.

**8\. What is Toys"R"Us' children's privacy policy?**

The Toys"R"Us Sites, including the Tabeo tablet, do not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If Toys"R"Us learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online without parental consent, it will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law). If you become aware of any personally identifiable information we have collected from children under 13, please contact us at contactus@toysrus.com or by calling 1-800-TOYSRUS (1-800-869-7787) or 1-888-BABYRUS (1-888-222-9787).

_Tabeo Tablet_

Third-party apps preloaded or downloaded to the Tabeo may collect your child's name, username or screenname, photos, video, or audio recordings, geolocation information, and IP address or other persistent identifiers. Certain apps may permit in-app purchases or include social network features. You should review the privacy policy of each application before you allow your child to access or download an app on the Tabeo. 

We encourage you to actively use the parental control features of Tabeo to monitor and control your child's use of Tabeo, including which apps they have access to. You should make sure you keep your parental password safe and not give it to your child. If you change your mind about an app and want to opt-out of allowing an app to collect information, you can block the app at any time through use of the parental controls feature of Tabeo. In those circumstances you may also want to contact the developer to ask them to not use and/or delete prior information collected regarding your child. 

For more information on the preloaded apps available on Tabeo, including the privacy policy for a particular app, please contact Toys"R"Us at: [contactus@toysrus.com](mailto:contactus@toysrus.com); by calling 1-800-TOYSRUS (1-800-869-7787) or BABYRUS (1-888-222-9787); or by writing Toys "R"Us Customer Service, One Geoffrey Way, Wayne, NJ 07470.

Toys"R"Us may participate in interest-based advertising. Toys"R"Us may automatically collect information regarding how you browse websites, use apps, play games, and shop in order to enhance your customer experience, improve our customer service, and provide you with communications and promotions from us or others. The goal of interest-based advertising is for Toys"R"Us or its advertising partners to show you ads that are more relevant to your interests. 

1\. You can choose to tell us not to collect this information and not to provide you with interest-based advertising. Note that if you choose to opt out, you may continue to see ads on Toys"R"Us websites and receive communications from Toys"R"Us, but they will not be based on how you browse and shop. To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, click here: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>

  * To successfully opt out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser. A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by a website to your computer's hard drive.

The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to enable or disable cookies. 
  * Opting out only applies to your current web browser on your current computer. If you use multiple computers or multiple web browsers, you must opt out using each one. 
  * Once you opt out, if you delete your browser's saved cookies, you will need to opt out again. 



2\. As an alternative, you can prevent Toys"R"Us from automatic collection of some information by disabling cookies on your web browser. The "Help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether, and the portion of this Privacy Policy above regarding "Flash cookie" addresses how to disable other types of automatic collection of information for these purposes. Note that some information will still be collected unless you opt out as described above. Also, note that if you reject cookies from Toys"R"Us Sites altogether, you may not be able to participate in certain activities or receive a promotion tailored to you. 

3\. Some websites may belong to ad networks that use browsing history across various websites to choose which ads to display on their sites; the displayed ads may include advertising for Toys"R"Us. To learn more and opt out of seeing interest-based ads on those websites, you should visit the National Advertising Initiative home page: [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). Websites may also offer their own opt-out methods for such advertising.
