# Familybuilder Including Family Tree on Facebook, Newsletters, and Genealogy

Last Updated:  July 2011 

We at iFamily Inc., doing business as Familybuilder("Familybuilder," "we", "us" or “our”), are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of personal information of our registered users ("Members"), visitors and unregistered users (collectively "Users" , "you" or “your”) of the Familybuilder.com website (the “Website”) and the Family Tree application and Just Moms application (the “Applications”) operated by us on a social networking site (“SNS”), such as Facebook.   

We have established this Privacy Policy to provide information regarding the collection and use of your personal information, so that you can make an informed decision about your use of the Website and Applications. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to the Website and Applications, and not to the SNS.  We ask that you please read and accept the privacy policy of the SNS as well. 

Familybuilder has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that our privacy policies and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with [_TRUSTe's program requirements_](http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html) including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.  The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software.   TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at [support@familybuilder.com](mailto:support@familybuilder.com).  If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact [_TRUSTe here_](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint).  


**_Information Collected_**  

**Personal Information:**

When you use the Website or an Application on a SNS, you allow us to access certain information from your profile from that SNS.  The information you allow us to access is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the SNS. For example, Familybuilder may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences:

  * ··· your “basic information” you have shared with everyone on the SNS
  * ··· your profile picture or its URL
  * ··· your user ID number, which is linked to publically available information such as name and profile photo
  * ··· the login e-mail you provided to that SNS when you registered
  * ··· your “family and relationship” information
  * ··· your “photo and video” information
  * ··· your “friends” information
  * ··· Other information indicated as part of the “Request for Permission” prompt from the SNS



Your agreement takes place when you "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) one of our Applications on a SNS.

Additionally, Familybuilder asks you for certain information in the course of building your family tree and using other Application functionality that you enter separately including relatives' names, emails, places of birth, dates of birth, and other such information. If applicable, when you add a relative who is also on the SNS to the Applications, we pull their publically available information and combination of basic information (gender, dob) and extended information (interests, activities) from their SNS profile and we display that information within the relative's profile. For non-SNS relatives, you can input a number of different fields - date of birth, gender, current location, anniversary date - which is used to create the family tree. 

You may also provide personal information to include in your profile or your family members’ profiles to tell others about yourself or those in your family tree, or when taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other lists.    


**Anonymous Information:**  

Familybuilder uses cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes and to make it easier to navigate the Website and Applications. Cookies are small text files that are stored on Users' hard drives. Our cookies are not linked to your personal information.  Familybuilder uses both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Website or Applications and expire when the User closes his or her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Website and Applications easier for returning Users by remembering a User's login information. Persistent cookies stay on a User's hard drive from one session to the next. You may choose not to receive cookies from Familybuilder by following instructions in your web browser's "help" file, but this may make certain features of the Website and Applications inaccessible to you.   


Familybuilder also collects Users' IP addresses and basic log file information (such as address, browser type and language, number of clicks, domain names of web sites visited, pages viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time) to help locate potential problems with our servers, and to aggregate general user statistics including demographic and geographical information. We use this information to analyze general usage patterns, and to provide advertisements and other services appropriate to the User's location. Familybuilder may aggregate User information in a non-personally identifiable manner to share with advertisers and to enhance the Website or Applications with new features. 

**Advertising**

We partner with third party ad networks to either display or manage advertising on our Website or Applications.  Our ad network partners use cookies, web beacons, javascript, or other tracking technologies to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other websites and applications to provide you targeted advertising based upon your gender, family status, interests, and other criteria.  They automatically receive your IP address when this happens.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by 

[_clicking here_](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)

.  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.

Familybuilder does not provide any personal information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This data is only shared in the aggregate. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Familybuilder to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. 

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The Familybuilder.com Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers.   


**_Use of Information_**  

**Personal Information:**

In addition to accessing certain information from your SNS profile as noted above, if you submit personal information to us through the Website or Applications, then we use this information to operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of the Website and Applications. You can set the privacy settings on your applications account to control the access of other Users and Member to the information in your family tree and other application-specific information.   You can update your privacy settings under the “Settings” link in the Website and Applications. Note that Members can forward this information to other Users or non-users.

**Email Communications from Us**

By providing Familybuilder your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you service-related notices, including among other things, notices required by law. You may not opt out of service-related e-mails. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including changes to Application features and special offers and third-party advertisements. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the email, or by changing your applications account settings on the SNS, located [_here_](http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy) or by contacting us by using the form located [_here_](http://apps.facebook.com/familytree/report). Opting out will prevent you from receiving promotional email messages regarding updates, improvements, or special offers and advertisements.

If you choose to use our referral service to invite a relative or friend to join our site, we will ask you for your relative’s or friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your relative or friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  We do not store this email address.   


**Anonymous Information:**

We store, track and analyze non-personal information, such as usage data, IP addresses, user preferences and user trends, to improve the quality and design of the Website and Applications and to create new features and services.
