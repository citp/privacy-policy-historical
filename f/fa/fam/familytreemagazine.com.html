<p><font face="arial, geneva" size="-1">At familytreemagazine.com, your online privacy is our highest priority. We appreciate your confidence in us and will continue to work diligently to uphold that trust and provide you with a safe and secure environment in which to use and enjoy our services.

</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva" size="-1">Familytreemagazine.com promises to never sell, trade, rent, barter or share
personally identifiable information collected during your use of our site
without your prior permission.

</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva" size="-1"><b>Information We Collect</b><br>
Like most internet companies, familytreemagazine.com automatically tracks
certain general information about you to help us continually improve the
content, design and layout of our site and give you more of what you want to
see and use. We collect your IP address -- a number automatically assigned
to your computer whenever you surf the web -- and use that number to monitor
customer traffic patterns and site usage. Measuring what parts of the site are most popular with our users helps us to tailor familytreemagazine.com to better suit your needs.

</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva" size="-1">In order to process, fulfill and service your book, magazine and school
orders, we require your email address, postal address, credit card number
and credit card expiration date. We keep this information strictly private
and confidential. Our security is provided from Verisign, the leading
internet security firm, and we use SSL (secure sockets layer) technology to
encrypt your information when it's transmitted over the internet, ensuring
that credit card numbers and other information can only be read by their
intended recipient. This technology is used any time you purchase something
with a credit card via our site.

</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva" size="-1">We may ask for personal information when you use certain features of our
site, including but not limited to: when you enter a contest or drawing;
when you sign up for our e-mail newsletter; or when you sign up for our
e-mail service. We also sometimes ask users to complete surveys used for
internal research purposes. If we ask for any specific demographic
information, it is only to help us tailor the information, products and
services we provide on our site to better fit your needs and interests.
Occasionally we may share non-individual statistical or demographic
information in aggregate form with third parties, but this is only done to
improve the quality and content of our site. We never share your personal
information with third parties -- only general information about the site's
entire user base. If you do not want us to share your general demographic
information with other companies or organizations, let us know by e-mailing
us at <a href="mailto:privacy@fwpubs.com">privacy@fwpubs.com</a>.

</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva" size="-1">We also never sell, trade, rent or release our e-mail lists to any
interested third parties. We may occasionally send information provided by
outside companies to our email users and subscribers, but only if those
users and subscribers have already given us specific permission to do so
during their intial registration for the services of our site. This
third-party information will always come to you directly from our servers
and will be indentified as a mailing from us, ensuring that no third party
will ever have access to our mailing lists.

</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva" size="-1"><b>What About "Cookies"?</b><br>
To service you faster and with better quality, we use cookies. "Cookies" are
small data files that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard
drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information.
For instance, when ordering books or other products, our website simply
assigns you a temporary ID number at random. That ID (and nothing else) is
saved as a cookie. This enables us to keep track of the information you
enter until you either place your order or close your browser, at which time
the unused cookie is automatically removed. All order information is
maintained on our secure server; only your temporary ID is passed back and
forth and saved in the cookie.

</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva" size="-1">Familytreemagazine.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns, and the
"shopping cart" function of our ordering process requires cookies. We may
also use cookies to track any of our outside promotional compaigns, such as
e-mail or other-site advertising, so that we can know how you learned about
familytreemagazine.com. Such information will enable us to better inform
potential users of our products and services and improve the quality of our
site. Some of our special services, such as familytreemail, use cookies to
identify users specifically, enabling us to "remember" your profile and
therefore provide you with more effective access to our products and
services. You can use most of the features on familytreemagazine.com without
having cookies activated in your browser.

</font></p><p><font face="arial, geneva" size="-1"><b>Changes to Policy</b><br>
Because earning your trust and confidence is so vital to us, we will always
be upfront with you about both our procedures for collecting information and
our use of that information. If we ever make any changes in either of these
procedures, we will immediately describe those changes clearly on this page.
If you have any thoughts or comments regarding this policy, please e-mail us
at <a href="mailto:privacy@fwpubs.com">privacy@fwpubs.com</a> and let us know.<br><br>
