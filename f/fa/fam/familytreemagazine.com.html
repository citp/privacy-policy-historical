<div><strong>SUMMARY<br>

</strong><span>At F+W, our goal is to offer products and services that will allow our customers to lead fuller, richer lives.  The same holds for how we communicate with you and how we handle your personal data.  It's important to us that you understand what information we collect, how we protect it, and how we use it — and to provide clear instructions if you choose to request changes in how we communicate with you. </span></div>

<div><strong><br>

GENERAL CONTACT INFORMATION</strong></div>

<div>Our postal address is:</div>

<div>F+W Media<br>

<div><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br>

</strong><span>Information about your computer hardware and software<br>

</span><span>For each visitor to our web site, our web server automatically recognizes your IP address.  The address allows our server to deliver the information you request from us, such as an article or a form for posting to a discussion board.  We also collect visitors' IP addresses in their domain-name form, allowing us to understand for instance how many visitors access our site through various service providers.  We collect this information on an individual basis and in aggregate, or combined, form.</span></div>

<p><span>We also collect both user-specific and aggregate information on what pages visitors access or visit.  We use the information to improve the content of our web pages and to customize the content and layout of our pages. </span></p>

<p><span>We use cookies to store visitors' preferences, record session information such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and to customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.  We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.</span></p>

<p><span>Email address, postal address, telephone number<br>

If at any time you provide us with your email address to place an order or access a service, we collect that information.  Areas in which we may collect your email address include but are not limited to discussion boards; chat areas; product or service transactions; emails you send us; and interactive forms.

		<p><b>www.fwpublications.com</b> is owned and operated by <b>F+W Media</b>, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
		
		<p>Your online privacy is our highest priority. We appreciate your confidence in us and will continue to work diligently to uphold that trust and provide you with a safe and secure environment in which to use and enjoy our services. 

		<p>Our privacy policy is outlined below. 
				
		<p>We promise to never sell, trade, rent, barter or share personally identifiable information collected during your use of our site without your prior permission. 
		
		<p><b>Information We Collect</b>

		<p>Like most internet companies, the web properties of <b>F+W</b> automatically tracks certain general information about our visitors to help us continually improve the content, design and layout of our site and give you more of what you want to see and use. We collect each visitor's IP address&#151;a number automatically assigned to the computer whenever you surf the web&#151;and use that number to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage. Measuring what parts of our sites are most popular with our users helps us to tailor them to better suit your needs. 

		<p>In order to process, fulfill and service your book, magazine and school orders, we require your email address, postal address, credit card number and credit card expiration date. We keep this information strictly private and confidential. Our security is provided from Verisign, the leading internet security firm, and we use SSL (secure sockets layer) technology to encrypt your information when it's transmitted over the internet, ensuring that credit card numbers and other information can only be read by their intended recipient. This technology is used any time you purchase something with a credit card via our site. 

		<p>Our sites may ask for personal information when utlize certain features, including but not limited to: entering contests or drawings; signing up for e-mail newsletter; or signing up for e-mail service. We also sometimes ask users to complete surveys used for internal research purposes. If we ask for any specific demographic information, it is only to help us tailor the information, products and services we provide to better fit your needs and interests. Occasionally we may share non-individual statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with third parties, but this is only done to improve the quality and content of our sites. We never share your personal information with third parties&#151;only general information about the site's entire user base. 

		<p>We also never sell, trade, rent or release our e-mail lists to any interested third parties. We may occasionally send information provided by outside companies to our email users and subscribers, but only if those users and subscribers have already given us specific permission to do so during their initial registration for the services of our site. This third-party information will always come to you directly from our servers and will be identified as a mailing from us, ensuring that no third party will ever have access to our emailing lists. 

		<p><B>What About "Cookies"?</b>

		<p>To service you faster and with better quality, we use cookies. "Cookies" are small data files that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. For instance, when ordering books or other products, our website simply assigns you a temporary ID number at random. That ID (and nothing else) is saved as a cookie. This enables us to keep track of the information you enter until you either place your order or close your browser, at which time the unused cookie is automatically removed. All order information is maintained on our secure server; only your temporary ID is passed back and forth and saved in the cookie. 

		<p>We use cookies to track user traffic patterns, and the "shopping cart" function of our ordering processes requires cookies. We may also use cookies to track any of our outside promotional campaigns, such as e-mail or other-site advertising. Such information will enable us to better inform potential users of our products and services and improve the quality of our sites. Some of our special services use cookies to identify users specifically, enabling us to "remember" your profile and therefore provide you with more effective access to our products and services. You can use most of the features on our sites without having cookies activated in your browser. 

		<p><b>Changes to Policy</b>

		<p>Because earning your trust and confidence is so vital to us, we are always upfront about both our procedures for collecting information and our use of that information. If we ever make any changes in either of these procedures, we will immediately describe those changes clearly on this page. Thank you.
