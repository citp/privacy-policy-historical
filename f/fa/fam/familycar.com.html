				                  <p><strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> recognizes the importance of maintaining your privacy. We value our  relationship with you and we appreciate the trust you show in providing  information to us. Explaining how we collect, use and protect customer  information is, therefore, of utmost importance to us. <strong>By visiting FamilyCar.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</strong></p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other  people or nonaffiliated companies except as disclosed in this privacy  policy. Your information will not be shared without your permission.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>Information Collected:</strong></p>
				                   
				                  <p>The information that we collect from you helps us personalize and continually improve upon your <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> shopping experience. You have the option not to provide certain  information; however, withholding information may prevent you from  being able to take full advantage of some of our web site features.</p>
				                   
				                  <p>This section of our privacy policy applies to all information collected by or submitted to <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong>. </p>
				                   
				                  <p>When  you visit our site, we automatically receive and store any information  you enter on our website. For example, you provide information when you  search for a product; place an order through <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong>,  provide information in your account; communicate with us by phone,  e-mail; complete a questionnaire or any other way. As a result of those  actions, you might supply us with such information as your name,  address, and phone numbers; financial information, such as credit card  or bank account numbers, including Social Security and driver's license  numbers; transactional information based on your activities on the Site  and content you generate or that relates to your account; shipping,  billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item,  community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence  through the Site, and correspondence sent to us.</p>
				                   
				                  <p>Whenever you  interact with us, we collect and analyze some data about you, which may  include the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) click stream to,  through and from our website, including date and time; cookie number;  products you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to  call our 800 number. Your IP address is used for <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> internal use only and helps us diagnose problems with our server and  administer our web site. We also automatically track certain  information about your activities on our web site. These may include:  browser type and version, operating system and platform; statistics on  page views, traffic to and from the Site, and ad data; standard web log  information; and purchase history. We use this information to do  internal research on your interests and to help us better understand  and serve you. If you are a registered <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> customer, we link this automatically-collected data to your personally  identifiable information. We may collect and measure session  information, including page response times, download errors, length of  visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as  scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away  from the page. </p>
				                   
				                  <p>We might also receive information about you  from other sources and add it to our account information. Examples of  these include updated delivery and address information from our  carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records  and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily; account  information, page-view information from some merchants with which we  operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical,  fulfillment, advertising, or other services; search term and search  result information including paid listings. Supplemental information  from third parties may also include credit history information from  credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to  offer certain credit or financial services to some customers. For  example, if the information you provide cannot be verified, we may ask  you to send us additional information (such as your driver license,  credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other  information confirming your address), or to answer additional questions  online to help verify your information.)</p>
				                   
				                  <p>We also store certain  types of information when you interact with us on our web site. For  example, we use "cookies" and can obtain certain information from your  web browser. By transferring these alphanumeric identifiers or  "cookies" that your browser creates at our request in an approved and  standardized place on your computer, <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> assigns you a unique customer code and records information about your  activity on our site. When you visit or return to our site, we read the  cookie to identify you as one of our customers and help you recall  orders or preferences you have selected. The cookie also enables us to  recall your past activities, post your account data, and tailor site  elements and special offers to you. The cookie does not retain your  billing information, nor does it save any of your personally  identifiable information in an explicit fashion.</p>
				                   
				                  <p>Most Web  browsers accept cookies by default, but allow users to reject cookies  by changing the browser preferences. If you have set up your browser to  reject cookies, some aspects of our site, including our Shopping Cart,  will not work properly. This privacy statement covers the use of  cookies by <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
				                   
				                  <p>We  use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These  companies may use a cookie or an action tag to track your response to  their advertisement and to measure the effectiveness of their  advertising or to award incentives or points to their members who  respond to their advertisements. <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> has no access to or control over these cookies. By using these Action Tags <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> does not gain access to any of your information collected by these  advertisers nor does it share any of your personally identifiable  information such as your name, telephone number or address with these  companies unless the advertiser or <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> otherwise notifies you. Please <a href="//www.networkadvertising.org/">click here</a> in order to learn more about the information collection practices of  some of the third party advertising companies we may use. Please <a href="//www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a> in order to learn more about the "opt-out" procedures of some of the third party advertising companies we may use.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> occasionally enters into cooperative marketing arrangements with  independent companies. Under these cooperative marketing arrangements,  our site may display the name and/or brand(s) of the independent  company. Personally identifiable information that you supply to us  while you are on our site, whether or not our site displays a name or  brand of another company, will be handled in accordance with this <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> Privacy Policy and will not be shared with the cooperative marketing company unless <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> otherwise notifies you.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>Use of Information:</strong></p>
				                   
				                  <p>To  carry out certain business functions, such as order fulfillment or  e-mail delivery, we sometimes hire other companies to perform these  functions on our behalf. These companies have access to the information  needed to perform their functions, but are required to keep it secure  and confidential and not use it for any other purpose than completing  their contractual requirements to <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong>. As a part of the normal process of completing your purchase, <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> may provide your personal data to a third party payment processor, depending on your chosen method of payment. </p>
				                   
				                  <p>Any  credit card or similar payment information you submit is used in  billing for the specific transaction in which the information was  submitted unless otherwise disclosed. Payment information is stored for  a time on our secure servers to allow the processing of refunds or to  respond to customer inquiries. Immediately after the completion of your <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> online transaction, you may be presented  with an opportunity to purchase third party products or services that  we believe may be of interest to you. These products and services are  offered by, and would be supplied by, independent companies not owned  or operated by <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong>. If you select one of the  presented offers, you will be redirected to the site of the third  party. Information you provide to the third party and any dealings you  have with the third party will be governed by the privacy and other  policies of that third party. We will not provide your credit card or  other payment details to a third party in connection with one of these  offers unless you indicate to us that we are authorized to do so.</p>
				                   
				                  <p>From time-to-time <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys  on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally  identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or  contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice  whether or not to disclose this information.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> may use aggregate, non-personally identifying information for purposes  that we deem necessary. For instance, we will use this non-identifying  and aggregate information to better design our web site and to share  with advertisers for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in  these instances we do not disclose anything that could be used to  identify you. We do not use or share the personally identifiable  information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones  described herein without providing you an opportunity to opt-out of  such operations.</p>
				                   
				                  <p>It is possible that in the future <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> or its assets may be acquired by another company. It is also possible that <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> may partner with or purchase another company to continue to do business  as a combined entity. In the event that this occurs, it is possible  that our customer information may be transferred to the new business  entity as one of <strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> assets. In such an  event, we will update this policy to notify you of such change in  ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection:</strong></p>
				                   
				                  <p>We may collect and disclose any information, including personally  	identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to  	comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or  	governmental request. We may collect and possibly share personally  	identifiable information and any other information available to us in  	order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal  	activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to  	the physical safety of any personal or as otherwise required by law. We  	may also exchange information, including personally identifiable  	information, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud  	protection and risk reduction.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>Secure Encryption</strong></p>
				                   
				                  <p>We  use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which is supported by the  vast majority of modern Internet browsers. SSL works best when you are  using the latest 128-bit encryption version of Microsoft Internet  Explorer.</p>
				                   
				                  <p>SSL technology represents the highest level of  security available on the Internet. It automatically encrypts  information traveling over the Internet, verifies the identity of the  transacting servers through certificates and digital signatures, and  confirms that the integrity of message content is maintained throughout  transmission.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> minimum  requirement for transactions is the standard 40-bit or 56-bit  encryption supported by the Internet Explorer 5.0 browser. If you are  not using this browser, please refer to your browser's documentation  for information on its security features.</p>
				                  <p>We transmit the  entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during  order processing, but we reveal only the last five digits of your  credit card numbers when confirming an order in compliance with Payment  Card Industry Data Security Standard.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</strong></p>
				                   
				                  <p>This privacy policy was last modified on 10/26/2007.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>FamilyCar.com</strong> may revise this policy from time to time. If we decide to change our  privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement so  that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and  under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right  to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it  frequently. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies  to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand  behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change  our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer  information collected in the past without the consent of affected  customers.</p>
				                   
				                  <p><strong>Credit Card Security</strong>
				                   
				                  
				                  </p><p> The FamilyCar Security Guarantee protects you while you shop  at FamilyCar so you never have to worry about credit card  safety. We guarantee that every transaction you make at  FamilyCar will be safe. This means you pay nothing if  unauthorized charges are made to your credit card as a result of  shopping at FamilyCar. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer  (SSL), an encryption technology that works with Netscape, Microsoft  Internet Explorer, AOL, and Apple's Safari's browser. This ensures that  only FamilyCar can read your personal information. We reveal  only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming  an order. We will, however, transmit the entire credit card number to  the appropriate credit card company during order processing. </p>
				                   
				                  <p> After you click on the "checkout"  button, be sure that the website's URL always begins with  https://www.FamilyCar.com/ The "s" in "https://" at the  beginning of the URL means you are logging into a secure page. If the  URL does not begin with https, you are not on any FamilyCar  page. </p>
				                   
				                  <p> FamilyCar has also  obtained a digital certificate from Network Solutions, a leading  provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secured portion  of our site, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in  the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a  small popup window displaying site-security information will appear.  This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being  transmitted in a secure (encrypted) form to an FamilyCar Web  server, not to an unknown or unauthorized server. </p>
				                         
				                        <p> This site is regularly tested and  certified to pass the HACKER SAFE Security Scan. HACKERSAFE helps  protect you from identity theft and credit card fraud. The "live"  HACKER SAFE mark appears only when a web site meets the HACKER SAFE  standard. </p>
				                         
				                        <p> Ultimately, your personal  information is protected by the password you created when you  registered for an account at FamilyCar on the "Log-In / Quick  Checkout" page. Please keep this password confidential. No  representative of FamilyCar will ever ask you for your  password. The confidentiality of your password is yours to protect. </p>

				                  </p><p> We understand that buying auto accessories for your vehicle can  sometimes be frustrating and confusing. There are times your local  parts store or dealer doesn't have the information or range of product  you are looking for.
