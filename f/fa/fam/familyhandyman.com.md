# Privacy Policy: The Family Handyman

Thank you for visiting FamilyHandyman.com, a community-oriented DIY web site that focuses on providing expert advice and how-to's for home projects for DIYers. The policies below are applicable to FamilyHandyman.com and other web sites on the World Wide Web, originating in the United States, and owned and operated by Home Service Publications, Inc. ("we" or "us") unless otherwise indicated. Your privacy is important to us. With that value in mind, we've developed this privacy policy (this "Policy") explaining the ways in which we collect personal information on FamilyHandyman.com (the "Web Site"), and how we protect it, and what choices you have about how information is used.  


**Changes to this Policy**  
We may revise or update this Policy at any time. If we make material changes, we will post the revised Policy on the Web Site and update its "last updated" date. We encourage you to check this Policy whenever you visit the Web Site to see if it has been updated since your last visit.  


**Scope of this Policy**  
This Policy distinguishes between personally identifiable information, which we refer to as "personal information," and "aggregate information" and other forms of non-personally identifiable information.

  * Personal information as used herein means information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number, and other information that is linked to personal information about you.
  * Aggregate information is aggregated information from which we have removed individual identities or other personal information, or information that we collect about the Web Site or about a group or category of products, services or customers that does not identify you personally. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Web Site.



This Policy applies to personal information collected by us on the Web Site. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.  


**How We Collect Personal Information**

  * Information you provide to us. We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use the Web Site. You may provide personal information to us at various locations on the Web Site. For example, we may collect your name, billing and shipping address, email address, telephone number, and credit card account number when you register and set up an account, subscribe to a newsletter or other publication, or purchase products or services on the Web Site. Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with participating in discussion forums, blogs, social networking services, or other interactive services on the Web Site. In addition, we may collect personal information you provide in connection with sending us emails or other communication through the Web Site or your participation in or response to surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Web Site. We may also collect other information about you that we may associate with your personal information such as your interests, preferences and demographics. For example, we may collect information about your interests in certain lifestyle topics. We collect this personal information for example, when you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a catalog, or register for a mailing list.
  * From time to time, we may make available certain applications for use on mobile devices (each application an "App" and each mobile device a "Device"). The type of Personal Information we collect will vary by App, but may include both precise and non-precise geolocation information in order to provide you with access to local service, offers and promotions relevant to the App (e.g., coupons for local stores). It is our practice not to store precise location information outside of your Device. In most instances, you will be provided with the ability opt-out of collection of location-based information in the user account settings for the particular App. As a general practice, we do not share precise location information with third parties except as necessary to complete a request that you initiate. Each App will include its own privacy policy explaining how we collect Personal Information when you use that App. You should always read the Privacy Policy before downloading the App.
  * We, our related web hosting providers, and our advertisers and ad serving and tracking companies sometimes utilize "cookie" technology on the Web Sites. Cookies are bits of data stored on your hard drive that contain no personally identifying information but which help enhance your Web-browsing experience. Not all Web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting that allows you to refuse and remove most types of browser cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may still enjoy the Web Site.
  * We may also use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control for videos, or display content based upon what you view on the Web Site to personalize your visit. Third party partners provide certain features on the Web Site and may display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, using Flash cookies to help track and store information about you.
