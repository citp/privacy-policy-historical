 <p>We at iFamily Inc., doing business as     Familybuilder("Familybuilder," "we", "us"   or “our”), are strongly   committed to protecting the privacy of personal   information of our   registered users ("Members"), visitors   and unregistered users   (collectively "Users" , "you"   or “your”) of the Familybuilder.com   website (the “Website”)   and the Family Tree application and Just Moms   application (the “Applications”)   operated by us on a social networking   site (“SNS”), such as Facebook.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <p>We have established this Privacy Policy   to provide   information regarding the collection and use of your personal     information, so that you can make an informed decision about your use     of the Website and Applications.  Please note that this Privacy Policy     applies only to the Website and Applications, and not to the SNS.&nbsp;   We   ask that you please read and accept the privacy policy of the SNS   as   well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Familybuilder has been awarded TRUSTe's   Privacy Seal   signifying that our privacy policies and practices have   been reviewed   by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html" target="_blank"><u>TRUSTe's   program requirements</u></a> including   transparency, accountability and choice regarding the   collection and   use of your personal information.&nbsp; The TRUSTe program   does not   cover information that may be collected through downloadable   software.&nbsp;&nbsp;   TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to   accelerate online   trust among consumers and organizations globally   through its leading   privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.   If you have questions   or complaints regarding our privacy policy or   practices, please contact   us at <a href="mailto:support@familybuilder.com" target="_blank">support@familybuilder.com</a>.&nbsp; If you are not satisfied with   our response you can contact <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint" target="_blank"><u>TRUSTe   here</u></a>.<br>
 </p>
 <p><strong><em>Information Collected</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Personal Information:</strong></p>
 <p>When you use the Website or an Application   on a SNS, you   allow us to access certain information from your profile   from that   SNS.&nbsp; The information you allow us to access is affected   by the   privacy settings you establish at the SNS. For example, Familybuilder     may access and store some or all of the following information, as   allowed   by you, the SNS and your preferences:</p>
 <ul style="font-family:arial; font-size:13px; font-style:italic; line-height:30px;">
   <li>··· your “basic information”     you have shared with everyone on the SNS</li>
   <li>··· your profile picture or its     URL</li>
   <li>··· your user ID number, which     is linked to publically available information such as name and profile     photo</li>
   <li>··· the login e-mail you provided     to that SNS when you registered</li>
   <li>··· your “family and relationship”     information</li>
   <li>··· your “photo and video”     information</li>
   <li>··· your “friends” information</li>
   <li>··· Other information indicated     as part of the “Request for Permission” prompt from the SNS</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Your agreement takes place when you   "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) one of our   Applications on a SNS.</p>
 <p>Additionally, Familybuilder asks you   for certain   information in the course of building your family tree and   using other   Application functionality that you enter separately including     relatives' names, emails, places of birth, dates of birth, and other     such information. If applicable, when you add a relative who is also     on the SNS to the Applications, we pull their publically available   information   and combination of basic information (gender, dob) and   extended information   (interests, activities) from their SNS profile   and we display that information   within the relative's profile. For   non-SNS relatives, you can input   a number of different fields - date   of birth, gender, current location,   anniversary date - which is used   to create the family tree. </p>
 <p>You may also provide personal information   to include in   your profile or your family members’ profiles to tell   others about   yourself or those in your family tree, or when taking advantage   of   promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters   or   other lists. &nbsp;<br>
 </p>
 <br>
 <p><strong>Anonymous Information:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Familybuilder uses cookies to collect   information for   record keeping purposes and to make it easier to navigate   the Website   and Applications. Cookies are small text files that are   stored on   Users' hard drives. Our cookies are not linked to your personal     information.&nbsp; Familybuilder uses both "session ID cookies"   and   "persistent cookies." Session ID cookies are used to store   information   while a user is logged into the Website or Applications   and expire   when the User closes his or her browser. Persistent cookies   are used   to make tasks like logging into the Website and Applications   easier   for returning Users by remembering a User's login information.     Persistent cookies stay on a User's hard drive from one session to the     next. You may choose not to receive cookies from Familybuilder by   following   instructions in your web browser's "help" file, but this may     make certain features of the Website and Applications inaccessible to     you.&nbsp;<br>
 </p>
 <p>Familybuilder also collects Users' IP   addresses and basic   log file information (such as address, browser type   and language,   number of clicks, domain names of web sites visited, pages   viewed, the   amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and   time) to   help locate potential problems with our servers, and to aggregate     general user statistics including demographic and geographical   information.   We use this information to analyze general usage   patterns, and to provide   advertisements and other services appropriate   to the User's location.   Familybuilder may aggregate User information   in a non-personally identifiable   manner to share with advertisers and   to enhance the Website or Applications   with new features.&nbsp;</p>
 <br>
 <p><strong>Advertising </strong></p>
 <p>We partner with third party ad networks   to either display   or manage advertising on our Website or Applications.&nbsp;   Our ad network   partners use cookies, web beacons, javascript, or other   tracking   technologies to collect non-personal information about your   activities   on this and other websites and applications to provide you   targeted   advertising based upon your gender, family status, interests,   and   other criteria.&nbsp; They automatically receive your IP address   when this   happens.&nbsp; If you wish to not have this information used   for the   purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank"><u>clicking here</u></a>.&nbsp; Please note this does not opt you out   of being served advertising.&nbsp; You will continue to receive generic   ads.<br>
   <br>
   Familybuilder does not provide any personal information to these   third-party   ad servers or ad networks. This data is only shared in the   aggregate.   However, please note that if an advertiser asks   Familybuilder to show   an advertisement to a certain audience or   audience segment and you respond   to that advertisement, the advertiser   or ad-server may conclude that   you fit the description of the   audience they are trying to reach.&nbsp;<br>
 </p>
 <p>You should consult the respective privacy   policies of these   third-party ad servers or ad networks. The Familybuilder.com   Privacy   Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities   of,   such advertisers.&nbsp;<br>
 </p>
 <p><strong><em>Use of Information</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Personal Information:</strong></p>
 <p>In addition to accessing certain information   from your SNS   profile as noted above, if you submit personal information   to us   through the Website or Applications, then we use this information   to   operate, maintain, and provide the features and functionality of   the   Website and Applications. You can set the privacy settings on your     applications account to control the access of other Users and Member     to the information in your family tree and other application-specific     information.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can update your privacy settings under   the   “Settings” link in the Website and Applications. Note that Members   can   forward this information to other Users or non-users.<br>
   <br>
   <strong>Email Communications from Us</strong></p>
 <p>By providing Familybuilder your email   address you consent   to our using the email address to send you service-related   notices,   including among other things, notices required by law. You   may not opt   out of service-related e-mails. We may also use your email   address to   send you other messages, including changes to Application   features   and special offers and third-party advertisements. If you do   not want   to receive such email messages, you may opt out by clicking   on the   unsubscribe link in the email, or by changing your applications     account settings on the SNS, located <a href="http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> or by contacting us by using the form located <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/familytree/report" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.   Opting out will prevent you from receiving   promotional email messages   regarding updates, improvements, or special   offers and   advertisements.</p>
 <p>If you choose to use our referral service   to invite a   relative or friend to join our site, we will ask you for   your   relative’s or friend’s name and email address.&nbsp; We will   automatically   send your relative or friend a one-time email inviting   him or her to   visit the site.&nbsp; We do not store this email address.&nbsp;<br>
 </p>
 <p><strong>Anonymous Information:</strong></p>
 <p>We store, track and analyze non-personal   information, such   as usage data, IP addresses, user preferences and   user trends, to   improve the quality and design of the Website and Applications   and to   create new features and services. We may use such information   to: (a)   remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it   during   your current or subsequent visits to the Website or Applications;   (b)   provide customized content and information; (c) monitor the   effectiveness   of our marketing campaigns and aggregate metrics such as   total number   of visitors and traffic; (d) diagnose or fix technology   problems; (e)   access your information after you sign in; (f) market   our Website and   Applications to advertisers and other third parties;   (g) aggregate general   User and Member statistics including demographic   and geographic information;   and (h) other purposes for which your   personal identity is not revealed.&nbsp;<br>

 <p>Any information or content that you   voluntarily disclose   for posting to public areas of the Website or Applications   (for   instance, in the forum or in sections of the Applications Home   tab)   becomes available to the public.<br>
 </p>
 <p><strong>Sharing of Information</strong></p>
 <p>Familybuilder will not share your email   address with   unaffiliated third parties without first obtaining your   permission and   notifying you at the point of collection. We share your   personal   information with other carefully selected partner companies   so that   they can market their products or services to you.&nbsp; If   you do not want   us to share your personal information with these companies,   please   contact us at <a href="mailto:support@familybuilder.com" target="_blank">support@familybuilder.com</a>. &nbsp; To unsubscribe   from these communications, click on the”unsubscribe” link on the   email communication. </p>
 <h2>Agents/Service Providers&nbsp;</h2>

 </p>
 <p>We may release your information if required   to do so by   law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary   to   comply with state or federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena,     law enforcement or regulatory request, or search warrant. We reserve     the right to collect and share any information: in order to   investigate,   prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual   illegal activities;   as appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms   of Use or investigate   potential or actual violations of the Terms of   Use or Privacy Policy;   to take precautions against liability; to   protect the security or integrity   of our Website and Applications; to   exercise or protect the rights,   property, or the rights and personal   safety of Familybuilder affiliates,   Users or others; or for other   legitimate purposes.&nbsp;<br>
 </p>
