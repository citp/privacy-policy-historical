    <p>This policy (together with our <a href="/home/terms?session=fFUyvAjTIgQDxwPmIaZEgwSFVZrqmZNZbUZJeMEmAZUReMbqhelTnbrBYYfbbgbi">terms of use</a> and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.  Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the <strong>Act</strong>), the data controller is us of 35 South Street, Elgin, Moray IV30 1JZ.</p>

    <h3>Information We May Collect From You</h3>
    <p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
    <p>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our sites as listed on our <a href="/home/terms?session=fFUyvAjTIgQDxwPmIaZEgwSFVZrqmZNZbUZJeMEmAZUReMbqhelTnbrBYYfbbgbi">Terms of Website Use</a> (<strong>our sites</strong>). This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our sites, subscribing to our service, posting material or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a competition or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our sites.</p>
    <p>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</p>
    <p>We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</p>
    <p>Details of transactions you carry out through our sites and of the fulfilment of your orders.</p>
    <p>Details of your visits to our sites including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data, whether this is required for our own billing purposes or otherwise and the resources that you access.</p>
    <p>Payment card details for the purposes of processing any payments you may make to use our sites.</p>
    <p>If you are under 18, you must ensure you obtain your parent/guardian's consent before providing your personal information to us.  Unless you are unable to provide verifiable evidence of this consent, you must not provide us with such personal information.</p>

    <h3>IP Addresses and Cookies</h3>
    <p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual, although we may use an IP address to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with other terms and conditions, or to protect our services and other users.</p>
    <p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our sites and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</li>
        <li>To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our sites according to your individual interests.</li>
        <li>To speed up your searches.</li>
        <li>To recognise you when you return to our site.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our sites. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our sites.</p>

    <h3>Where We Store Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things,  the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.  Only our employees and approved contractors/developers we may appoint from time to time and who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to such information.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

    <h3>Uses Made of the Information</h3>

        <li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.</li>
        <li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.</li>
        <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.</li>
        <li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which you have previously requested or bought from us.</p>
    <p>If you are a new customer, we will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this.</p>

    <h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
    <p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
    <p>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</p>
    <p>If Hunted Cow Studios Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</p>
    <p>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="/home/terms?session=fFUyvAjTIgQDxwPmIaZEgwSFVZrqmZNZbUZJeMEmAZUReMbqhelTnbrBYYfbbgbi">terms of use</a> and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Hunted Cow Studios Limited, our customers, or others.
