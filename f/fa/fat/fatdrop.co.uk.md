Your privacy is important to us and we respect your right to privacy in relation to any data that you submit to us via the use of the FATdrop website and/or FATdrop application available on mobile devices (the "Services").  The Services are designed to provide clients with complete control over their data and end users the ability to unsubscribe from the Services at any time. 

We do not rent or sell data to third parties unless we are required to by law or you consent to such use. 

We expect all our clients to respect the privacy of their opt in users' data within the parameters of our Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions.
