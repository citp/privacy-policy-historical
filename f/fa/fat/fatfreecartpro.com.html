<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>INFORMATION E-junkie.com GATHERS AND TRACKS</h3>
<h4>E-junkie.com gathers two types of information about users:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions.            These are voluntary submissions like registration, to receive our electronic            newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email            a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Information E-junkie.com gathers through aggregated tracking information            derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site. Our web server(s)            log IP address and visitor's domain name. The domain name and IP address            reveal nothing personal about the visitor. This information maybe be            used for purposes such as examining traffic and to investigate misuse            or abuse of any aspect of this site. This information is stored in a            protected area of the site's logs and may be shared at the discretion of Sine Info Ventures Pvt. Ltd. with appropriate law-enforcement bodies or in good faith            with other third parties. We do not collect nor evaluate this information            for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not automatically record            e-mail addresses of the visitors.</li>
</ul>
<h4>E-junkie.com gathers user information in the following processes:</h4>
<h5>Optional Voluntary Information</h5>
<p>We offer the following services, which require some type of voluntary          submission of personal information by users:</p>
<ol>
    <li>E-mail notifications<br>
    We will send out notifications about payments and other activity related          to your account. You might also receive periodic notifications about the          changes in features for as long as you a registered member of E-junkie.com.          You may cancel your subscription anytime from <b><a href="http://www.e-junkie.com/ej/admin.php">Seller Admin</a> &gt; Cancel Subscription</b>.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)<br>
    We will offer a electronic newsletter to users. E-junkie.com gathers the          email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves          from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter          that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also          subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Message boards/forums<br>
    Users of the site’s Message Boards and Forums must register to use these services free of charge in order to post messages,          although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration          the user is required to supply a password and email address.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>"E-mail this to a friend" Service<br>
    Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents          to someone else by clicking “e-mail this to a friend”. The user          must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This          information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course,          to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used          for any other purpose.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Polling<br>
    We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their          opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important          issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not          identifiable to any particular user. E-junkie.com may use a system to          "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once          on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information          about individual users.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Surveys<br>
    E-junkie.com may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our          content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic          information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Children</h5>
<p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of          1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable          information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental          consent.</p>
<h5>Usage tracking</h5>
<p>E-junkie.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites.          However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual          users. E-junkie.com does break down overall usage statistics according          to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type of content provided by reading this information          from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser which is transmitted automatically in the course of any HTTP connection).</p>
<p>E-junkie.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users          enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with          individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas          of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.          We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page          performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for          you.</p>
<h3>USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
<p>E-junkie.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance          their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive          or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content          based on the interests of our users.</p>
<p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in          order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate          in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters          to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and          occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might          be particularly interested in something we are doing. When we use tracking          information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't          like based on traffic to those areas, we do not track what individual          users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps          us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered          in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users, but we don't track which terms any particular user enters.</p>
<p>E-junkie.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic          patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers          to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements          that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns          of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific          user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any          individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process          or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
<h3>SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</h3>
<p>E-junkie.com uses the above-described information to tailor our content          to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's          demographics.</p>
<h3>OPT-OUT POLICY</h3>
<p>We give users options to opt-out wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which          completely obviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information          from our users</p>
<h3>YOUR CONSENT</h3>
<p>By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information          by E-junkie.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post          those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information          we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</p>
<h3>COOKIES</h3>
<p>Some elements of our site may send your computer a Cookie. A Cookie is          a very small file which computers use to store information about websites          and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Third party Cookies motioned above are not personally identifiable -          that is to say, they do not allow third party advertisers to gain significant          personal information about who you are.</p>
<p>Cookies may be used to identify trends in a user's browsing pattern.          Information gathered from visitors' visits to this and/or other sites          may be used to determine which advertisements are served on this and/or          other sites.</p>
<p>Visitors may choose not to allow Cookies to be served to their computers          as a way of opting-out from such anonymous identification. Visitors          should investigate the functionality of their Internet browser which may provide a means to disallow          Cookies. We do not provide technical support for such activities.</p>
<p>Forum members may be served an additional Cookie which allows their browser          to verify their identity at each visit without the user having to manually          log in.</p>
<p>In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party          advertiser may place or recognize a unique Cookie on your          browser.</p>
<h3>REGISTRATION</h3>
<p>Optional registration for site promotions, newsletters, member access          areas and the Forums may request additional personal information about          a user. This information is stored in a protected area of the site's database          and may be shared at the discretion of Sine Info Ventures Pvt. Ltd. with appropriate law-enforcement          bodies or in good faith with other third parties.</p>
<h3>SECURITY AND TERMS OF USE</h3>
<p>This site has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss,          misuse and alteration of the information under our control.</p>
<p>By using our site you consent to the collection and use of information          as specified in this policy. Should we decide to alter our Privacy Policy,          this page will be updated to reflect those changes in order to keep our          visitors in the know.</p>
