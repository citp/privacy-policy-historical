# Web Hosting by FatCow - Privacy Statement

|  |   
[Home](https://web.archive.org/)Web Hosting by FatCow - Privacy StatementPrivacy Statement _**Our Commitment to You:** _ FatCow is dedicated to establishing trust with you, our customer, and to protecting your privacy. This value is demonstrated by how we treat your identifying information. All personal information collected by us will be used for the sole purpose of maintaining our hosting relationship with you. When you sign up for Web hosting services with FatCow, you will be asked to provide contact and payment information. The contact information will include your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. The payment information typically includes your credit card number. In the normal course of providing our Web hosting services, we also create and maintain other information, such as account status, system usage, plan type and support requests. **How does FatCow use customer information?** We use customer information to notify you of system and service related issues, including system upgrades, scheduled maintenance, network downtime, newly added services or features and any other communication deemed relevant to the continuance of our service. We do not sell or rent FatCow customer information. We share aggregate, non-identifying customer information with partner companies when a customer has requested a service or product that uses the services of an outside company (for example, domain names). The information given will only be that which is necessary to implement the service or product requested. Our Web site contains links to carefully chosen partner Web sites in order to provide our customers access to complementary services. Personal information may be collected on those Web sites, and the use of that information is regulated by each partner's individual Privacy Policy. FatCow does not review the privacy policies of such Web sites and is not responsible for the actions, errors or omissions of those Web sites. FatCow may collect certain technical and routing information including traffic patterns, IP addresses, browser types, operating systems and CPU speed. This information is gathered to facilitate the use of our Web site and enhance service delivery. Domain registration information becomes public record in the universally available Whois database when a customer registers a domain name with FatCow.  
As required by law, we will disclose that customer information specifically required to name, contact, or bring legal action against persons causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of FatCow, our customers, or others, and in response to legitimate court orders, subpoenas, warrants or as otherwise required for law enforcement purposes. **How does FatCow protect customer information?** We protect our customers' information both online and offline. Online, your account information is protected by the leading industry standard method of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. Furthermore, all credit card information is encoded, and our database servers are protected from hackers by not having a publicly routable IP. Your information is also protected in our offices. Our employees are well informed about our privacy practices, and access to customer information is restricted to what is necessary to perform their specific tasks. Moreover, we notify our employees of any changes to our Privacy Statement and corresponding requirements. **Referrals and special offers** When you take advantage of special promotions to refer a friend to FatCow, be assured that the only information we collect is their name and e-mail address for the sole purpose of sending an invitation. From time to time, FatCow informs our customers about new products and services. You may choose to opt out of receiving such notifications by simply accessing your account through the Control Panel. Within the Account Management options, select "Manage subscriptions" to update your subscription settings. Please note that you will continue to receive important system notices as well as invoices and communications specific to your account. **Contests or surveys** From time to time, FatCow may invite you to participate in a contest and/or survey. Depending on the nature of the contest or survey, separate terms and conditions may apply. We may make your participation in a contest or survey contingent upon our ability to use your name or biographical information in our marketing and PR promotions. Despite any new terms and conditions, we intend to maintain the spirit of this Privacy Statement with respect to your personal and sensitive information. We will never intentionally release, sell or rent the information you give us in a survey, and all information you give us will be used strictly to improve our service offerings or better understand our customers and the market we serve in a general way. **How does FatCow use cookies?** Cookies are pieces of information generated by a Web server and stored on a user's computer. FatCow does not use cookies to track or collect information specific to the Web activities of our customers. We exclusively use cookies to authenticate customers accessing the Control Panel and to securely store your login data, and we use cookies to track usage patterns in a general way. Whenever possible, we use session cookies, which remain active only while your browser is open. After the browser is closed, session cookies expire. **How can I review or makes changes to my personal information?** If you wish to review or need to update your account information, simply access your account through the Control Panel on the FatCow Web site and make the changes through the Account Management options. Alternatively, you may call our Customer Service Team at 1.888.278.9780, Monday through Friday 6 am to midnight, and Saturday and Sunday from 8 am to 8 pm MST, and a representative will be happy to assist you. **Updates to this Privacy Statement** We notify customers of changes to this policy by placing a notice on the Control Panel, and we encourage you to contact us at [legal@fatcow.com](mailto:legal@fatcow.com) with any questions you have about the changes or any of our policies.
