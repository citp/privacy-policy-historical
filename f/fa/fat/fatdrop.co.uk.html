    4. Keeping Your Personal Information Secure
        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;
            4.1. The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored
            at, at destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). &nbsp;It may also be
            processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our
            suppliers. &nbsp;Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of
            your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support
            services. &nbsp;By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer,
            storing or processing. &nbsp;We will take steps reasonably necessary to ensure that
            your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
            </li>&nbsp;
            <li>&nbsp;
            4.2. All information you have provided to us is stored on our servers. &nbsp;We
            follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information
            which you have given to us, to prevent unauthorised access. We use industry
            standard technology to encrypt your personal information. However, the Internet
            is not a secure environment and we cannot guarantee the security of any
            information which you send to us.
            </li>&nbsp;
            <li>&nbsp;
            4.3. When using the FATdrop website:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    4.3.1. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which
                    enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for
                    keeping this password confidential. &nbsp;We ask you not to share a password with
                    anyone. &nbsp;We are not responsible for any loss that results from the unauthorised
                    use of your username/password, with or without your knowledge.
                    </li>&nbsp;
                    <li>&nbsp;
                    4.3.2. Unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is not
                    completely secure. &nbsp;Although we will do our best to protect your personal
                    information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted
                    to or via the Services; any transmission is at your own risk. &nbsp;Once we have
                    received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features
                    to try to prevent unauthorised access.
                    </li>&nbsp;
                    <li>&nbsp;
                    4.3.3. To reduce the risk of unauthorised access to your personal information
                    when accessing the Services you should use a security enabled-browser to submit
                    your information. &nbsp;If you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk of
                    having your information intercepted. &nbsp;We will not be responsible for any
                    compromise of information that is intercepted due to your use of an insecure
                    browser.
                    </li>
                </ul>&nbsp;

                    FATdrop application on your mobile device. &nbsp;You agree to notify us immediately
                    on becoming aware of any unauthorised use of the FATdrop application or your
                    mobile device. &nbsp;We are not responsible for any loss that results from the
                    unauthorised use of your mobile device, with or without your knowledge.
                    </li>&nbsp;
                    <li>&nbsp;
                    4.4.2. To reduce the risk of unauthorised access to your personal information
                    on your mobile device we recommend that you use a password lock on your mobile
                    device. &nbsp;We will not be responsible for any compromise of information that is
                    intercepted due to your use of an insecure mobile device.
                    </li>
                </ul>&nbsp;
            </li>

            <li>&nbsp;
            5.2. We will only pass on your information to selected third parties if it is
            necessary to perform the Services or with your prior consent. Those third
