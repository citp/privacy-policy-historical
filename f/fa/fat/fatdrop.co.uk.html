  or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy 
  explains how we use the information we collect about you through FATdrop, how 
  you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures 
  that we have in place to safeguard your privacy. This Privacy Policy forms part 
  of our Terms and Conditions.</p>
  <p>1. Contact details <br>

  (together, the "Services") are provided by FATdrop<br>
  Contact e-mail: <a href="mailto:info@fatdrop.co.uk">info@fatdrop.co.uk</a></p>
  <p>2. Introduction <br>
  2.1 We process personal data in accordance with, the United Kingdom's data protection 
  laws. </p>
  <p>2.2 This Privacy Policy covers the provision of the Services only and not any 
  other companies' websites which you may access from the Site or by using the 
  Services. </p>
  <p>2.3 If we change the Privacy Policy we will place notices on the Site and post 
  the changes on this page. If you do not accept any changes to the Privacy Policy 
  please stop using the Services and close your account. </p>
  <p>3. Personal Information Collected <br>
  3.1 We will only collect personal information about you that you have given, 
  either: <br>
  (a) when you register for the Services; or <br>
  (b) if you have previously registered your details with a company which has 
  since joined the FATdrop Services. </p>
  <p>3.2 When you register to use the Services you may be asked to provide personal 
  information such as your name, postal and e-mail addresses, contact telephone 
  numbers, date of birth, gender and other lifestyle information. </p>
  <p>4. Use of personal Information <br>
  4.1 We may use personal information for: administrative, operational and marketing 
  purposes and to communicate with you about your use of the Services any changes 
  to the Services. We will only pass on your information to other companies if 
  it is necessary to perform the Services or with your prior consent. Those companies 
  may contact you to inform you of their services and products. Any personal information 
  that you choose to provide to us or to other companies using our Services will 
  only be used in support of the intended purposes stated at the time at which 
  it was collected and subject to any preferences indicated by you. </p>

  those third parties to resolve the matter. </p>

  may be disclosed to our advisors and any prospective purchasers and their advisors 
  and will be passed on to the new owners of the business. </p>

  so by law. </p>

  strategic development purposes. </p>
  <p>6. Cookies </p>
  <p>6.1 We may use "cookies" to collect aggregate information. A "Cookie" 
  is a small piece of information sent by our web server to your web browser, 
  which enables us to record anonymous details and allows you to move around the 
  Site faster. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, for instance to enable 
  us to simplify the logging on process, to help ensure the security and authenticity 
  of members and to enable traffic monitoring.</p>

  know how to do this, please look at the help menu on your browser. However, 
  if you turn off the cookie function your use of the Services may be impaired.

  to aggregate information) to third parties overseas to enable us to perform 
  services requested by you. </p>

  may be transferred in transit to countries outside the European Economic Area 
  that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and its use 
  as set out in this policy. However, we do our best to ensure that your personal 
  information is secure. </p>
  <p>8. Security </p>
  <p>8.1 As required by under UK data protection laws, we follow strict security 
  procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given 
  to us, to prevent unauthorised access. We use industry standard technology to 
  encrypt your personal information. However, the Internet is not a secure environment 
  and we cannot guarantee the security of any information which you send to us.</p>
  <p>9. Other websites </p>
  <p>9.1 Our Site may contain links to other websites which are outside our control 
  and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other websites using 
  the links provided, the operators of these websites may collect information 
  from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy practices, 
  which may differ from ours. </p>

  if you change your e-mail address, or you do not wish to receive information 
  about a particular product or service, or if you wish to close your account, 
  please email us with your new details and we will update you account.</p>
  <p>10.2 If you close your account, other companies with which you have registered 
  via the Services may continue to process your data but they should not contact 
  you without your consent. </p>
