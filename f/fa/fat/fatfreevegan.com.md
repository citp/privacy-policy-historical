# FatfreeVegan.Com Privacy Policy

> **Fatfree Vegan Recipes** and **FatFree Vegan Kitchen** are owned and operated by Susan Voisin.  Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to me, and I want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.
> 
> **Fatfree Vegan Recipes** makes available recipes submitted by site visitors as well as recipes in the archives of public email mailing lists and internet message boards.  Many recipes posted on [FatFreeVegan.com](http://fatfreevegan.com/) are original, but others are already freely available elsewhere on the internet; we make every attempt to assign authorship to recipes when it is known and to provide a link to the original recipe whenever possible.  If your recipe appears on FatFreeVegan.com without your permission, please contact the webmaster at ADMIN (at) FATFREEVEGAN (dot) COM and request that the recipe be removed. All reasonable efforts will be made to honor such requests.
> 
> Please remember that anything you disclose by posting to mailing lists or forums becomes publicly available and you should exercise caution when you participate. If you post to a mailing list or group such as YahooGroups, your email address is available to other members of the list, but it will not be published on this site unless you ask us to include it. 
> 
> If you wish to retract information that you have posted directly to this site, please contact the webmaster at ADMIN (at) FATFREEVEGAN (dot) COM and request that the information you have posted be removed. All reasonable efforts will be made to honor such requests.
> 
> **INFORMATION FATFREE VEGAN GATHERS AND TRACKS**
> 
> Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.
> 
> **FatfreeVegan.Com gathers two types of information about users:**
> 
>   * Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to register for the main website, to participate in our message boards or forums, and from participation in polls and surveys:   
> 
>   * Information FatfreeVegan.Com gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because FatfreeVegan.Com derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does FatfreeVegan.Com divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.
> 

> 
> **FatfreeVegan.Com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:**
> 
> **Optional Voluntary Information**
> 
> We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:
> 
> 1\. Registered member/forums policy
> 
> Users of the site must register (free of charge) in order to post recipes and forum messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.
> 
> 2\. Polling and recipe ratings
> 
> We may offer interactive polls and the opportunity to rate recipes to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about individual recipes. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. FatfreeVegan.Com may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.
> 
> **Usage tracking**
> 
> FatfreeVegan.Com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. FatfreeVegan.Com does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).
> 
> FatfreeVegan.Com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.
> 
> **Cookies**
> 
> We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. FatfreeVegan.Com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.
> 
> You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling and surveys.

> When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.
> 
> FatfreeVegan.Com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
> 
> ### SHARING OF THE INFORMATION
