# Fabric - Store

**Our Promise to You**   
Fabric.com is committed to protecting your privacy and building a foundation of trust with our clientele by adhering to the strictest Internet privacy standards and deploying the most sophisticated security measures available. At Fabric.com, we are dedicated to respecting your privacy and ensuring your security on our site. The following privacy and security policy is to inform you about how and why we collect any information about you, and what we use this information for on our website. 

**Information That We Collect and How We Use it  
** Fabric.com collects from our users only the information that is necessary to complete an order - billing information and credit card information. Fabric.com is the solitary holder of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in any ways other than disclosed in this privacy statement.

 **Registration  
** Registration is not required in order to use our site. Users have the option to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is then used to contact the user about the products and services on our site for which they have expressed interest. 

**Your Order**   
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name, phone number and shipping address) and billing information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill the customer's order. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. If you submit a different address for shipping than for billing, that personal information is only used for the purpose of shipping the package. The shipping recipient will not be added to any marketing distribution list or future correspondence. **

 **Orders Sent as Gifts**

** If you submit a different address for shipping than for billing, that personal information is only used for the purpose of shipping the package. The shipping recipient will not be 'opted-in' to any marketing distribution lists or future correspondence.. 

**Cookies  
** A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

Fabric.com also employs a third party clickstream tracking company. This provider is used to aggregate the visitor's site navigation and identify exit pages where customers leave the site. No personal identifying information is recorded by this tool, and only Fabric.com has access to the summarized data. Fabric.com does not share any of this information with other partners or vendors. 

**Log Files  
** We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track the user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Security**   
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing.' While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to: 

[Customercare@fabric.com](mailto:Customercare@fabric.com)

**Special Offers**   
We send all new registered members a welcoming email. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice policy below. 

**How You Can Access and Edit Your Registration Information or Remove Yourself From Our Newsletters, Updates & Reminders Lists**:  
You are able to review and edit your registration information from our site at any time. If you have already registered with us, _[click here](https://www.fabric.com/MyAccount-MyProfile.aspx)_ to access your information. Our mailing lists and email notification are available on an opt-in basis. If you would like to opt out of all email communication, _[click here](https://www.fabric.com/MyAccount-MyEmailPreferences.aspx)_. If you would like to restrict our use of your information, contact us in one of the ways provided below. While we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of your information, we reserve the right to delete customer information if we can't reasonably accommodate a requested restriction.

**Order Fulfillment**  
We have an in-house fulfillment department to ship orders and in-house, secure electronic transaction processing software to charge users for goods and services. These entities do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes, and are prohibited from using the data for any other purposes. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:  
** If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by emailing our Customer Support at: 

[Customercare@fabric.com](mailto:Customercare@fabric.com)

**Notification of Changes**   
If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our website homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will only use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

**Legal Disclaimer  
** Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.
