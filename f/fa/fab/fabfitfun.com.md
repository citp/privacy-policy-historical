# Privacy Policy - FabFitFun

Effective Date: March 1, 2017

**_Introduction_**

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to allow you (the “User”) to understand how we (“FabFitFun”) collect and use the personal information you provide to us through the websites that we own and operate (in each case, the “Website”), including fabfitfun.com and ish.co.

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by FabFitFun and does not apply to information collected by any third-party sites to which FabFitFun may link or to information provided to, or collected by, third-parties through cookies, web beacons, or other third-party technologies served during your visit to the Website.

**_Information We Collect and How We Use It_**

**Personal Account Information:** If you choose to sign-up for our subscription box service, or engage in other transactions or activities (for example surveys or sweepstakes entries, among other things), or sign up for other services, on our Website, you will likely be asked to provide certain basic information, such as your name, e-mail, address, telephone number and credit card or other payment information. You may also be asked to provide some information about your preferences, tastes or individual characteristics. All of this information submitted by you will be subject to this Privacy Policy and is called “Personal Account Information.”

FabFitFun may use your Personal Account Information to provide products, services and information requested by you and to operate, maintain, customize and personalize your experience with the Website and FabFitFun products and services. We may also use Personal Account Information to contact you or send you notifications about products and services that you have ordered or that we otherwise think may be of interest to you.  
FabFitFun may provide your Personal Account Information to third-party service providers that we engage to assist us with the operation of the Website and the provision of products and services. Such access is provided with the understanding that these parties will use the information for these limited purposes and in accordance with our Privacy Policy. 

Unless otherwise disclosed at the time of collection of information, FabFitFun does not share Personal Account Information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. FabFitFun may, however, provide general demographic, aggregated, or deidentified information about Users and customers and their preferences to advertisers and other existing or prospective business partners.

**Technical Data:** When a User visits the Website, we may collect information regarding the User’s browser type and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address and store such information through use of “cookies.” A cookie is a small file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that uniquely identifies your browser. The cookies enable FabFitFun to confirm that Users have visited previously, to keep track of the status of your shopping cart, and to perform other functions on the Website. You can set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. However, if you set your browser to disable all cookies, some features of the Website may not function properly.

Also, when you use the Website, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends automatically whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of your use of the Website.

**Referral Information:** We often invite Users to tell a friend about our products or services. In that event, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting them to subscribe to FabFitFun’s box program or other product or service, and we will typically include a discount or other promotion to encourage your friend to become a User or customer. This information may be used to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [privacy@fabfitfun.com](mailto:privacy@fabfitfun.com) to request that we remove their information from our database.

**_Additional Information About Use and Sharing_**

In addition to the uses described above, FabFitFun may use the information it collects in any of the ways described below.  
FabFitFun reserves the right to share Personal Account Information if: 

(a) we believe we are required to do so in accordance with a law or to respond to a subpoena or court order; 

(b) we believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to enforce our Terms of Use and Sale;

(c) we believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to take precautions against liability;

(d) we believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations;

(e) we believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to assist government agencies;

(f) we believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the security or integrity of the Website;

(g) we believe that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, safety or property of FabFitFun, our Users or others; or

(h) FabFitFun becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or other transaction resulting in a change of control of FabFitFun or a sale of substantially all of the assets of the business or of a particular product line or division of the business, in which case Personal Account Information may be transferred in connection with the transaction and may become subject to the privacy policy of another entity. 




If we obtain technical data from our Users, we may use such information for the following purposes: 

(a) to diagnose and prevent service or technology problems that are associated with the IP addresses; 

(b) to help us provide you with customized content and promotions that match your stated preferences;

(c) to prepare geographical or other statistical data to help us better serve our Users;

(d) to create new features, promotions, and services in connection with the Website; and

(e) to monitor the use of the Website. 




**_Third-Party Advertising_**  
FabFitFun permits third-party advertisers to provide advertisements to you through the Website. Although Personal Account Information may be used to send or display targeted advertisements, FabFitFun does not provide any Personal Account Information to advertisers other than in aggregated or de-identified fashion. Advertisers may also download cookies onto your computer, which would enable them to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement whether or not you are visiting the FabFitFun site or another site. As a result, the advertiser would have the ability to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe would be of most interest to you. FabFitFun does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed on your computer by third-party advertisers.

**_Security_**

We take reasonable and appropriate measures to help keep information secure and to help prevent it from becoming disclosed. Even though we follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in our possession, no security system is perfect so we cannot guarantee, and you should not expect, that your information will be secure in all circumstances.

**_Other Sites_**

As noted above, this Privacy Policy only applies to our Websites. Our Websites may include links to other sites, but FabFitFun does not control the privacy practices of other sites. FabFitFun is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.

FabFitFun may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updated policy will be posted on this page and the effective date of the updated policy will be indicated at the top of the page.

**_Miscellaneous_**

**Do Not Track Signals:** Some web browsers and devices allow you to broadcast a preference that your activities online not be “tracked”. At this time, our Website does not take action in response to “do not track” signals.

**Children:** We do not provide products and services to children. We do not knowingly collect or solicit information from children under the age of 13.

A parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13) may review and request deletion of a child’s personally identifiable information as well as prohibit the use thereof. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove that information and terminate the child’s account.

**Your California Privacy Rights:** Residents of the State of California, under certain provisions of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third-parties to which the company has disclosed certain personally identifiable information as defined under California law during the preceding year for third-party direct marketing purposes.  
FabFitFun does not disclose personally identifiable information to third-parties for their direct marketing purposes.
