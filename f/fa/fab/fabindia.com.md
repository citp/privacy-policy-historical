**When and what information does Fabindia collect?**

Fabindia collects basic information required to service your requests, including your name, mailing address, email and phone number. This information is gathered when you purchase products/gift certificates, or sign up for email notifications. Your card information is requested only when you place an order and is submitted via the highest level of encryption to ensure the greatest amount of safety and security.

When you browse our website, we also use “cookies” or bits of tracking data to gather information about your preferences. This includes your internet service provider’s address and your clicks and activity on our website. We do not trace this information to individual customers and will never use cookies to save confidential information such as passwords or credit/debit card information.

**Why do we collect this information?**

The primary reason we gather information is for order processing, shipping and customer service. For example, we may contact you to provide an update on your order, information regarding the shipping status or to clarify questions related to your order. We also use this information to improve our products, services, website content and navigation.

**What steps does Fabindia take to ensure security when shopping online?**

When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of secure socket layer (SSL) technology. The secure socket layer (SSL) encrypts all information you put in before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we have employed reasonable and current Internet security methods and technologies.

www.fabindia.com web site makes use of 128 Bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt credit card and billing information while it is transmitted over the internet. We do not record or retain your card information at all as it is directly passed over to the payment gateway for processing through the 128 Bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

When you make a purchase online, either a solid key or a locked padlock icon will appear in the lower right of your browser window. This icon indicates that your transaction session is secured through Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

The information is sent to your card issuer's bank over a secure, proprietary connection. When the authorization process is complete - this takes around five seconds - you receive an approval or decline response in your browser, and we are informed appropriately to initiate the shipping process.

**Does Fabindia share my information with other companies?**

Fabindia respects that you do not want your personal information shared with other companies. Therefore, the information which you provide will only be used for your intended purpose and to complete your online purchase. Fabindia does not share, rent or sell your information with any other company.

**Links to other sites**

At times, Fabindia may provide links to other company websites which we believe may be of interest to you. Fabindia is not responsible for the content or services on these sites, and if you choose to explore these links we suggest you review their privacy policies.

**How do I update my account information?**

It is quick and easy to update your account information. Simply log in at My Account and proceed to 'Account Information'. Please note that we do not store your credit/debit card information in your personal profile.
