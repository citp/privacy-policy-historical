We use your personal data for the following purposes (i) to be able to service the agreement we have with you, (ii) to improve our website, prevent or detect fraud or abuses of our website and (iii) enable third parties to carry out technical, logistical or other functions. In this Privacy Policy we will lay down the specific processing of your personal data for the specific purposes we have defined as well as how you can control the personal data we store about you. Here are the types of information we gather:

We receive and store information and personal data from you when you interact with us through our website. The information and personal data concerned are: your IP (Internet protocol) address, your computer and browser type and version, your login attempts, your search queries, and other browsing activities on our website relevant to monitor the function(s) of our website, hereinafter referred to as "Automatic Information". We use the Automatic Information for the purpose of (i) delivering our services you wish to receive and (ii) improving our website. We collect your IP address, to track technical issues and errors so we are able to improve our website. We use your IP address and log activities to be able to avoid or eliminate fraudulent use of your account. This way we can – for example – see if there is an irregular amount of login attempts on your account. This may indicate fraud.

We store your IP address and your activities on our website for this purpose in our logs for a maximum of seven days. You may always contact us if you wish to delete this information and/or personal data from our files.

The web shop for our merchandise is serviced by sprd.net AG. They collect personal data from you to handle your orders, deliver services to you, process payments, and communicate with you about orders respond to your requests. For further explanation and information please read the [sprd.net AG Privacy Policy](https://www.spreadshirt.com/privacy-policy-C3259). Sprd.net AG does _not_ share any personal data about you with us. 

## How secure is information about me?

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that all processing of your personal data will meet the requirements by law and ensure the protection of your rights. However such protection can unfortunately not be guaranteed, as no system available is one hundred percent safe. We work to protect the security of your personal data during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information and the personal data you input. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal data. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you. It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer, and to not use the "Keep me logged in on this device" login feature in this case. 

Our computers are safeguarded by long and complex passwords. Our servers are physically situated in the Netherlands and serviced by a Dutch company. Our physical office can only be entered by authorized personnel. Visitors can only enter the building that our office is situated in, after being given access by authorized personnel. We have created access profiles for our employees giving them limited access to our systems and (personal) data actually needed to perform their work. 

Your privacy is of continuous importance to us, meaning we will evaluate our privacy policy frequently and are open to improvement and discussions. 

## What information can I access and control?

You can chose not to provide us certain personal data, such as your zip code. Not providing us with certain data may render us unable to fully assist you. We might – for example – need more personal data to verify your identity when you have lost your password. 

We give you access to the personal data that we keep about you and a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with us for the purpose of viewing and updating or changing that information. This concerns the following personal data: your address, e-mail address, subscription to newsletter, an overview of historical purchases (via which you can view your purchased license keys), and the amount of credit you received by using the tell-a-friend feature. You can add or update certain information on your FabFilter account. You may alter your subscription to the newsletter yourselves as well as the possibility to view your historical purchases and associated license keys. If you don't want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust this preference in your FabFilter account or use the unsubscribe link that is placed at the bottom of every (promotional) e-mail of FabFilter you will receive. 

Certain updates and changes to Account Information are – for your safety - carefully controlled by us and may for that reason not always be made by yourselves. We will be available to assist you with such changes. Changes to your personal data shall be made in cooperation with us, to make sure such changes are correct and are not requested by anyone else but yourselves. 

You cannot delete your personal FabFilter account yourself. However, if you request us to do so, we will delete your account for you. 

If you wish to receive an even more detailed list of the personal data we use and store about you, please contact us and we will inform you accordingly. If such an overview would not be sufficient to you, please let us know, and we will inform you even more specifically where needed. 

## Do we share the information we receive?

Information about our customers and their personal data is an important part of our business and we are _not_ in the business of selling it to others. We share your personal data only as described below and with the subsidiaries that are either subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy. 

  * #### Third-party service providers

We work together with Cleverbridge AG to handle sales through the/our web shop. They only have access to personal information they collected from you themselves. They process the personal information in accordance with their own Privacy Policy and as permitted by applicable data protection laws. 

We use two software systems to communicate through e-mail. All e-mails automatically generated by our website (such as the e-mails you receive when you create an account or our newsletters) are services through a program called Mandrill, that is part of the platform MailChimp. MailChimp is owned and controlled by The Rocket Science Group LLC, located in the USA. MailChimp participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. 

The second software system we use concerns our support e-mail communication. The program facilitating this service is called Manuscript owned and controlled by Fogcreek Software Inc. Fog Creek complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. Fog Creek has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. 

  * #### Protection of FabFilter and others

We release Account Information and other personal data when we believe release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply agreed terms or agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of FabFilter, our users or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in a way that is contrary to the commitments made in this Privacy Policy. 

  * #### With your consent

Other than as set out above, you will receive a specified notice before your personal data may be shared with third parties giving you the opportunity to inform us that you wish us not to share this personal data, after which we will abstain from doing so. If you choose to consent to the transfer of data, you may at any time retract your consent and we will cease sharing your personal data immediately. 

  * #### Transfer outside the European Economic Area

Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside of the European Economic Area in the course of sharing information as set out above, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as permitted by the applicable laws on data protection.
