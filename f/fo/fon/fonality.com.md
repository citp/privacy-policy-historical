# Privacy Policy | NetFortris.com

**General**

NetFortris takes your privacy and the confidentiality of your business data very seriously. We understand that your business communications solution is critical to your business, and that you need to trust that system and the company that provides it fully.  This policy outlines the types of information NetFortris may collect, and our commitment to keeping that information safe, secure, and private.

**Collection and Use of Customer Information**

NetFortris provides a service where customers may upload and store their system configuration information and call statistics data on NetFortris servers and equipment. Customers have the ability to disable the collection of call statistics data, which will cause all call data to be stored locally on the customer’s server. Disabling this data collection will disable any available graphical reporting capabilities.

In addition, NetFortris software gives customers, at their discretion, the ability to record and save voicemails, phones calls and chats. All communications content is stored locally on the customer’s server(s), and unless provided for under separate terms and conditions, NetFortris does not store any voicemail, call recordings, chats or other communications.

NetFortris does not review, edit, disseminate, or use individual customer information, data or communications in any way, except to investigate a technical support request initiated by a customer, to investigate a suspected terms of use violation, or as may be required by law. We may use aggregated, non-identifiable usage statistics to assess system performance and scale.

**No Monitoring of Customer Communications**

All phone calls are routed locally on the customer’s individual system, and externally via the customer’s selected communications service providers. NetFortris does not monitor the content of customer phone calls.

In order to monitor the performance of your system, NetFortris provides you with technical support, product enhancements, and upgrades. NetFortris by default maintains a secure electronic connection to your server(s). NetFortris implements numerous security techniques to ensure the safety of customer data and system access and to minimize the risk of network intrusion.

Customers can, at their discretion, elect to disconnect this connection. Disconnecting the connection will prevent the administration of your server(s), and will disable other important features, including graphical reporting.  In addition, we will not be able to provide technical support or software updates until the connection is re-established.

**Billing Information**

When NetFortris bills for services rendered, a third-party processing company may be used to charge customer credit cards and collect payment. A third-party is used only to process credit card charges, and does not store or distribute customer credit card or billing information.

**NetFortris Web Properties**

NetFortris may collect information from visitors to the NetFortris.com web site, or any other web sites operated by NetFortris. We may collect the Internet addresses of NetFortris site visitors. We use the information that we log from the NetFortris website to both improve our services, and help troubleshoot possible NetFortris website problems. We may also analyze non-identifying statistics that we collect from website visitor usage, and provide this data to qualified third parties.

Additionally, NetFortris web properties may contain content from third-party content providers, but these content providers neither receive nor distribute NetFortris user or customer information, nor do they receive user or customer information from NetFortris.

**Electronic and Physical Mailing Addresses**

NetFortris requires a valid, working e-mail address upon account setup in order to send account information details, including account username and password. If you wish to receive no further communications from NetFortris after the installation process is complete, you may send a request at [http://cp.fonality.com/support.](http://cp.fonality.com/support) Removal from this list will significantly limit our ability to provide you with technical support. In addition, NetFortris may periodically communicate with you regarding new products, product updates, and important NetFortris news and information. You have the option to exclude yourself from these communications. If you would like to cease receiving communications from NetFortris, please send a request [http://cp.fonality.com/support/](http://cp.fonality.com/support) with the subject line “UNSUBSCRIBE”.

NetFortris will not sell or distribute your e-mail or physical address to any third party, other than a) a qualified provider of services to NetFortris who also subscribes to the terms of this Privacy Policy or b) with your express permission, to a qualified NetFortris partner upon your request.

**Cookies**

Our sites use cookies to enhance the user's experience by allowing us to recognize a user's return visit to our own service. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have their browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function as effectively, and you may be unable to log into our web based administration tools, preventing the administration of your system.  We may use a third party to provide statistical analysis regarding our web users and may set cookies in order to gather the information needed to perform their statistical analysis. The information collected by the third party cookies does not contain any personal information and cannot be linked back to any individual user.

**Log Files**

We use and collect IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, and to track users’ movement across the site, and may provide this data to qualified third parties to help us improve the site and our service.

**Links**

Our web sites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by NetFortris web properties site or the NetFortris application.

**Surveys**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information and demographic information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site or of the NetFortris application.

**Security**

NetFortris implements numerous security techniques to ensure the safety of customer data and system access. Your information is encrypted and authenticated, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. The SSL systems provide data security for you and your users, and the authentication ensures that your valuable content is available only to registered users, and is not accessible to unwanted parties. Each registered user in your organization is provided with a unique username and password. Each time a user logs onto your NetFortris application, they can only be authenticated and allowed access using the correct username and password that has been assigned. A session is issued for the purpose of capturing encrypted authentication data for the length of the session. Neither the username nor the password is included in the session. Security protocols put into operation by NetFortris are determined by encrypted session Ids and dynamic data.

NetFortris complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  NetFortris has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view NetFortris’ certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.

**Children's Privacy Policy**

NetFortris does not sell products or services for purchase by children. NetFortris does not knowingly solicit or collect customer identifiable information from children or teenagers under the age of eighteen. In addition, NetFortris will not knowingly link to any third party web site that solicits or collects customer identifiable information from minors. If you believe that a minor has disclosed personally identifiable information to NetFortris, please contact NetFortris at [http://cp.fonality.com/support/](http://cp.fonality.com/support) so that the information can be removed.

**Your Responsibilities**

We promise to be extremely careful with any information you entrust us with, and we would ask that you do the same. This includes ensuring the physical and electronic security of your network, and maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of your own data, usernames and passwords.
