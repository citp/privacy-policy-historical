Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

For instance, we use cookies to help us store and recall your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with an improved service.

We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since each browser is a little different, please look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

  * the page accessed
  * the date and time of access to the Internet site

We may analyze this anonymous data statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The server log files are stored separately from any personal data which you may provide.

**Third-party disclosure**
