# YourFonts - Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Updated: Thursday, September 3, 2009 (previous version can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/privacy20090106.html))

#### Philosophy

We are only interested in collecting and retaining the information that is necessary to effectively run our business. We respect your right to keep your personal information private.

#### Uploaded Files and Generated Fonts

All uploaded files and generated fonts are stored on our servers for a maximum of 15 days. We never share personal information. Occasionally an attempt to generate a font fails, and then we might look into such problem to see if we can improve our font generation algorithm. So that's the only possible reason for us to use uploaded data, and even then it's only used to look into issues with our font generator. Although it makes us happy to see so many people pleased with their own custom fonts, we are by no means interested in the individual fonts generated through our service. We prefer to put time and effort in improving existing and developing new software and services.

#### E-mail

We will not sell your e-mail address, nor do we provide it to advertisers or mass marketers. In other words, you will never receive junk mail based on information you submit directly to us. You may remove yourself from our electronic mailing lists by following the directions included in each e-mail or at [this page](https://web.archive.org/newsletter.html).
