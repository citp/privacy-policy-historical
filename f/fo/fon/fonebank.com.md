We may use other companies to help provide or maintain different parts of our website and service and in doing so they may process your personal information. In these instances, we are the data controller and the other companies must comply with our strict privacy requirements. 

We link to other companies’ websites from our website. We try to only include quality, safe and relevant links but we cannot guarantee or verify the content of any externally linked website. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they should have their own privacy policies and we have not endorsed or approved those policies. We cannot be held responsible (and do not accept any responsibility or liability) for the uses to which any other company puts your personal information once you have left our website. 

Where permitted by law, we may also disclose your personal information: 

  * if we sell the group or any company or part of the group;

  * to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our group; our customers, or others.



We may also exchange your personal information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

**Where we transfer your information:**   
Some of the personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Union (EU). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EU who work for us or for one of our suppliers. 

Some of our services are provided by companies based in the United States (for example, Amazon Web Services, Ebay, Cloudflare and Google Cloud Platform). When your personal information is transferred to the US we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and all appropriate legal and regulatory requirements. Many of the companies we use are certified by the Privacy Shield framework (which sets security and privacy requirements for protection of your personal information) and we have written agreements with them to ensure they cannot process your personal information for any other purposes or share it with any other companies without our express permission. 

By submitting your personal information to us, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. 

**How we keep your information safe:**   
Keeping your personal information secure is very important to us. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security measures to protect it. Our website is secured by RapidSSL and we use a secure protocol (https://) to encrypt your information between your computer’s browser and our website. We protect our network with the latest firewall technology and we securely store personal information and encrypt your bank account details and passwords. We restrict the number of our staff that have access to any personal information and we have secure backup systems to ensure that any personal information cannot be lost or deleted. We train all our staff so that they understand the importance of keeping our customers’ personal information secure. 

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone and to choose a strong password (which should contain a mixture of letters and numbers). 

Please bear in mind that no information sent over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you send to our website and it is sent at your own risk. 

**How to change your preferences:**   
If you no longer wish to be contacted by us, then you can let us know by emailing our customer services team ([ot@cmrecycling.co.uk](mailto:ot@cmrecycling.co.uk)) or by writing to us at our registered address. 

All marketing emails have a clear unsubscribe link and if you click it then we will automatically unsubscribe you and you will not receive any further marketing emails. 

**How to get your information corrected or request we stop using it:**   
If you have any concerns about the accuracy of your personal information then you can contact us in writing by post or email (details below) and we will correct it. 

If you want us to stop using your personal information then please contact us in writing by post or email (details below) explaining why you object to its use and what you want us to do. We will then respond appropriately to your request. 

Please note that if you do not provide us with your personal information or object to us using it then this may prevent us from fulfilling certain requests (for example we cannot help you with certain enquiries without your contact details and we cannot fulfil a request to recycle your mobile device without your contact details). 

**How to find out what information we hold:**   
You have the right to get a copy of the information we hold about you. This is known as a subject access request. 

If you wish to make a subject access request then please contact us in writing by post or email (details below). You must provide your full name, address and a contact telephone number. 

If we hold information about you we will: 

  * give you a description of it;

  * tell you what we are using it for;
  * tell you who it could be disclosed to;
  * tell you how long we keep it; and
  * let you have a printed copy of the information or, if you prefer, provide it to you in a commonly used electronic format.



We will do this free of charge and we will respond to you within one month or your request. 

If you identify any inaccuracies in the information we send you then let us know and we will correct it. 

**Changes to this privacy policy:**   
We update our privacy policy from time to time so we suggest you review it each time you provide any personal information. Any changes we may make in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified elsewhere on the website.
