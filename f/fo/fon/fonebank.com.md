**Part 3**

Fonebank processes digital information about Users (web surfers) who visit websites belonging to Clients with whom Fonebank has contracted to serve advertisements (the "Advertising Network"). This part of the Privacy Policy lets you know what information we collect and process about you as a User on behalf of our Clients, why we collect it and how it is used in relation to our Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services to our Clients. The Policy contains instructions on how you can display and delete information collected by Fonebank yourself and how you can opt-out from further Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting activities of Fonebank. Further, the Policy contains instructions to our publishers on how to notify Users about Fonebank’s services on their websites. 

**What is Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting?**

There exists a range of different kinds of online Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services; from fairly simple forms to the far-reaching monitoring of web surfer activities carried out by search-engine owners or services carried out in partnerships between technology companies and Internet Service Providers. As a common denomination, you could say that Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting is intended to make online display advertising more relevant to web surfers' likely interests. 

Fonebank’s Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting services are cookie based. "Cookies" are small simple text files (not programs or spyware) stored on the hard drive of a web surfer's computer. Based on the anonymous information stored in the User's cookie, Fonebank is able provide more relevant advertising to the User on behalf of our Clients. For example, a User that visits recycling sites often will be categorized in the "recycling" segment, and will primarily be served advertisements that are relevant to the interests of a mobile recycling. 

The fundamental integrity principle underlying all Fonebank’s processing of digital data relating to Users, is that such data shall be anonymous. Therefore, we do not store IP addresses on the cookie of a User, only a unique randomly generated ID that does not allow Fonebank to trace the User; we do not have, and will not initiate, any co-operation with Internet Service Providers in order to trace the identities of Users. The data stored on the cookie is limited to information collected at the User's visits to websites belonging to Fonebank’s Advertising Network. With the exception of a marginal proportion of cookie data saved for statistical purposes solely, a User's cookie can only be viewed by Fonebank when the User visits a website that belongs to our Advertising Network. 

**Targeting information**

**Use of collected digital data**

Fonebank will use the User data in order to better target advertisements on behalf of our Clients, to provide aggregated non-personal reporting to our Clients, and to improve our advertising systems and products. The data may be combined with other anonymous information collected from other sources so that we may better serve Users with offers that may be of interest to them. We may also share anonymous data between companies within the Fonebank group of companies. 

**Security**

Fonebank is dedicated to maintaining the security of all its data and preventing unauthorized access through the implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures, as far as is reasonably possible. Such security measures also include access restrictions, i.e. that data may be accessed only by a limited number of persons within Fonebank. 

Our employees are made aware of, and must comply with, Fonebank’s security measures. When we occasionally use third-party contractors to perform tasks that might otherwise be performed by our employees, these contractors are contractually bound to adhere to this Privacy Policy and they are subject to similar restrictions as our employees. 

**Opt-out**

You may at any time easily block further cookie-based Interest Based Advertising and Retargeting activities from Fonebank by opting-out. 

In addition, note that you are always able to prevent cookies from any website from being installed on your computer by readjusting your browser settings. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you should consult the help section of your browser.
