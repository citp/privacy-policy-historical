<strong>
Focalex's General Privacy Statement.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Last Updated on 07/18/2007
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions
regarding this statement, you should contact our privacy group
by email (<a href="mailto:privacy@focalex.com">privacy@focalex.com</a>) or you can
send inquiries via postal mail to: Focalex, Inc., Privacy Group, 300 Fifth Avenue, 3rd Floor, Waltham, MA, 02451.
</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up via
Focalex.com.  Focalex may edit this privacy policy from time to
time. When we make any substantial changes of users' Personally
Identifiable Information, we will notify you by posting a prominent
notice on our privacy policy and our home page, <a href="http://www.focalex.com">www.focalex.com</a> and we will provide
an opportunity for you to opt-out of any further use of your
Personally Identifiable Information.
</p>

<p> 
Focalex created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our
firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information
gathering and dissemination practices for this web site. To
ensure that all of our users are completely opt-in, we have a double
opt-in confirmation mechanism. We also make it easy for our
subscribers to unsubscribe whenever they want without hassle. Focalex
focuses on getting permission from subscribers to send information,
NOT spam.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<u>Registration</u>

<p> 
Our site's registration forms ask for users to provide us their email
address and zip code.  In addition, subscribers may optionally provide
additional demographic and psychographic information in the sign up
form, the sign up process, or later through contests, surveys, and
other web activities. This information includes, but is not limited
to, mailing address, industry, occupation, age, gender, or phone
number.  We collect this information in an effort to better target
user interests.  Completing the forms is completely voluntary and no
user is obligated to provide this information to Focalex.
</p>

<p>
Focalex offers various contests, promotions, and surveys to surfers,
which may ask for further demographic information. This information is
for use by Focalex for tracking and targeting purposes and is stored
in our database. Mailing addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and
demographics may be provided to third parties for advertising purposes
as required in the contest rules.
</p>

<p>
In accordance with COPPA regulations, Focalex, Inc. does not allow
individuals aged 13 or younger to participate in contests and
promotions on pages where Focalex asks for age. Data is not collected
from individuals specifying an age of 13 or less. Focalex in some
cases employs a drop down box that will only collect data from those
citing a year that states their age to be over 13.
</p>

<u>Refer a Friend</u>

<p>
You may refer a friend to our offers, by using the refer-a-friend
service.  If you do so, we will ask for your friend's name and email
address.  We will send your friend a one-time email message inviting
him or her to visit the site.  Focalex uses this information for the
sole purpose of sending this one-time email message.
</p>

<u>Publishers</u>

<p>
We additionally allow publishers to join our affiliate program.  The
signup form for this program requires similar information, in addition
to sensitive information such as social security number or tax ID.
When you enter your social security number on our application form, we
encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>

<p>
Publishers have the opportunity to refer another publisher to our
affiliate program.  If you do so, like Refer-a-Friend, we will ask for
the publisher's name and email address.  We will send the publisher a
one-time email message inviting him or her to visit the site.  Focalex
does not store this information in its database, and uses it for the
sole purpose of sending this one-time email message.
</p>

<u>Uses Of Information</u>

<p>
Focalex is a direct marketer that delivers targeted messages to the
email addresses of specific community members. Subscribers of the
Focalex community have requested that they receive information. If a
user subscribes to our mailings, we ask for information to efficiently
target a particular interest and ultimately offer the subscriber, with
quality and efficiency, exactly what he/she has opted to receive.
</p>

<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

<u>Aggregate Information</u>

<p>
We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with
our partners and advertisers.  This information does not identify
individual users.  We do not link aggregate data with personally
identifiable information.
</p>

<u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>

<p>
Focalex shares email addresses and other demographic information with
third parties for mail delivery on behalf of Focalex. In these cases,
Focalex only uses trusted partners, and has strong non-disclosure
agreements in place to prevent any privacy concerns. Focalex shares
data with trusted third parties to prevent you, the subscriber, from
receiving duplicate offers and to provide the best possible service
for the subscriber. Focalex will not disseminate personally
identifiable information, except that we use the personal information
that you supply to us with other third party businesses to bring
selected opportunities to you via direct mail, email and
telemarketing. These businesses include providers of direct marketing
services and applications, including lookup and reference, data
enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing.
</p>

<p>
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable
information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is
necessary to protect our rights and / or to comply with a judicial
proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.
</p>

<h2>Choice / Opt-Out</h2>

<p>
Users will be given the opportunity to opt out of any future mailings
at any time by sending an email to the unsubscribe address in most
messages. Users wishing to unsubscribe can also send a message to <a href="mailto: help@focalex.com">help@focalex.com</a>.
</p>

<p> 
Focalex handles unsubscribe requests at <a href="mailto:help@focalex.com">help@focalex.com</a>. These requests
are processed within a week of the request. Be aware that Focalex also
includes both an unsubscribe address and a purge address in the header
of most mailings.
</p>

<h2>Use Of Cookies</h2>

<p>
Focalex uses cookies for a variety of purposes. Cookies are a piece of
data stored in the browser's memory, and may or may not be written to
the surfer's hard drive when the browser is closed. This allows
customization of what is displayed to the surfer across sessions,
enables tracking of user actions, and user profiling. Information
stored in cookies may be added to Focalex's databases, or used as a
means to identify a user. While a user can use Focalex sites without
cookies enabled, displays will not be customized, and in some cases,
the site may not work at all. Turning off cookies also limits the
ability, or in some cases precludes the ability, to participate in
various Focalex contests and giveaways. Some of the advertisers who
use our site (both on the web and in e-mail messages) may use cookies
on their site. This is something over which Focalex has no control.
See "Third Party Advertisers".
</p>

<h2>Web Beacons / Web Bugs</h2>

<p>
We employ image loading tracking (a.k.a. Web Beacons / Web Bugs) that
help us better manage offers provided on our site by letting us know
what offers are effective, as well as to track activity via email.
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in
function to cookies, to track the online movements of Web users.  We
additionally use graphics that are not clear gifs for a similar
purpose.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's
computer hard drive, these images are embedded on web pages.  In the
case of clear gifs, they are invisible and are about the size of the
period at the end of this sentence.  We tie the information gathered
by image loading tracking to our customers' personally identifiable
information, but not to information such as credit card, financial
information, or social security numbers.
</p>

<p>
This information is used to track the effectiveness of campaigns, as
well as the effectiveness or particular offers.
</p>


<h2>Third Party Advertisers</h2>

<p> 
The web pages at <a href="http://www.focalex.com"> www.focalex.com</a>
and some of the email sent by Focalex contain links to external sites
beyond our control. Focalex cannot represent or guarantee that these
third parties' privacy statements conform to our privacy policies. Any
site linked to the Focalex site may have a Privacy Statement that
differs from our own. Please review the privacy statement of any site
linked from Focalex.
</p>

<p> 
From time to time Focalex may offer the opportunity to sign up to
third party offers through the signup process. When this is the case,
the offerings will be clearly marked as signups for that third
party. Signing up for such offerings is completely voluntary and not
required for any Focalex services. If the user does not wish to sign
up for those offers, the user should simply not submit to them. As
such, information submitted on those offerings may be submitted to the
third party. Please refer to the third party's privacy policies for
further information. For more information on third party ad servers,
please refer to the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network
Advertising Initiative</a>.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Focalex may provide individual or summarized information
to reputable third parties when, for whatever reason, Focalex is unable
to deliver to specific advertisers though our current delivery system.
</p>

<h2>Access To Personally Identifiable Information</h2>

<p>
Updates to your list preferences can be made by using the manage
preferences link in most email messages.  If you would like to
correct, update, delete, or deactivate other profile information, you
can do so by contacting customer support at <a href="mailto:help@focalex.com">help@focalex.com</a>, or by sending a
postal mail message to Focalex, Inc., 300 Fifth Avenue, 3rd Floor, 
Waltham, MA 02451
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p> 
This site has security measures in place to ensure against the loss,
misuse, or alteration of information under our control. Focalex
protects the integrity and security of its data by following
industry-standard procedures and guidelines. Only key executives and
members of the development team at Focalex possess the passwords
required to access files requiring security clearances. All Focalex
employees are made aware of corporate security policies upon hire,
change of position or change of policy.
</p>

<p>
Focalex, Inc. does have a security module in place. The module
encrypts the Social Security Number and/or Tax ID Number, which is
required upon registration to the Focalex Affiliate Program. The
encryption and security measures taken to protect this information
will protect you, the user, from any harmful external activity, such
as computer hackers. The information is only available to the
accountant of Focalex, Inc. and those members of the development team
who possess passwords to secure areas of the Focalex Network.
</p>

<h2>Indemnity</h2>
<p> 
The subscriber agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Focalex
and its directors, officers, agents, and employees for any and all
losses, costs, liabilities or expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' and expert witnesses' fees) incurred or arising
from (a) any breach of Subscriber's Covenants, (b) any user-generated
content or (c) any claims arising from the sale or license of goods or
services promoted or made available through Focalex. Focalex's
indemnity rights shall not be limited or offset by any contributory
negligence by Focalex. Focalex may participate in the defense at its
expense.
</p><p>
Any additional information offered or any additional services
requested by you, the user, outside of the Focalex, Inc. domain will
be subject to the Privacy Statement within that particular
site. Focalex is not responsible for actions by the user outside of
the focalex.com web site.
