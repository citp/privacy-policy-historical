We collect certain information when you visit our website.  This information tells us such things as how many people visit our site and which pages they have visited.  This information assists us with maintaining and designing a user-friendly website.

We collect this information through “browser cookies” (as described below).  To assist visitors with technical problems, we also may collect local web configuration information, including browser type, operating system, and various other browser settings.

In addition, our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer when you visit our website.  This information may include the type of browser software you use, the operating system you’re running, the IP address assigned to your computer or Internet connection, and the IP address of the website, if any, that referred you to our website.  Our technical staff may also use this information to assist customers with technical problems.

If you decide to sign up with us for the purpose of participating in our focus groups, we will collect information about you that will enable us to determine whether you qualify for one or more focus groups, and that will enable us to invite you to participate in specific focus groups.

We do not knowingly reveal any personal information that is provided by our visitors or focus group participants to any third parties except as provided in this Privacy Policy, when requested to do so by a governmental agency having jurisdiction, by a court of competent jurisdiction or other operation of law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.  Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the personal information you have provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

**QUESTIONNAIRES AND SURVEYS**  
On occasion upon entering our website, you may be asked to complete an on-line survey or questionnaire.  These surveys and questionnaires will seek your opinions, attitudes, interests and even your activities on-line.  Any personal information gathered through your participation in questionnaires or surveys will not be kept unless you agree to provide us with that information.

If you sign up to participate in focus groups, your personal information will only be used to verify that you qualify for a particular focus group, and so that we can send you e-mails containing links to surveys or questionnaires to be completed online.  However, we will not provide your name or contact information to the entity that requested we conduct the focus group research. Any personal information gathered through your participation in online surveys or questionnaires will not be kept unless you agree to provide that information again when completing the survey or questionnaire, and in most instances, surveys and questionnaires will not ask for any personal information.

**CHILDREN USING THE INTERNET**  
This website and our focus groups are not intended for children under the age of 14.  For that reason, we strongly encourage parents to supervise their children when visiting our website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 14.  If you believe we have collected personal information from children under the age of 14, please notify us immediately so that we may take steps to eliminate such information.
