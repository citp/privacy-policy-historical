##### _Who We Are ?_

We develop and license an online marketing system that allows its users to manage and promote client programs and opportunities of their choice (the "System"). The System is operated and managed by FocalPoint, LLC., located in the State of New Jersey in the United States.

Because each account is controlled by an independent representative, we cannot guarantee how the System and your Personal Data will be managed by these representatives.

An individual who subscribes to the FocalPoint System is referred to as a "Member" of the System. The Member's targeted audience is the "Subscriber" or “Contact.” "Users" or "you" include Members and Subscribers, as well as anyone visiting this site.

"Personal Data" means any information that identifies or can be used to identify a user directly or indirectly. Examples of Personal Data include, but are not limited to, first and last name, email address, phone number, or other demographic information.

To cater to Users of our site, we may be required to collect, use, and share certain information, including Personal Data. The type of information we collect, together with a description of how we use and/or share it, is described below.

##### _Information Collection and Use_

Our legitimate interests typically include: improving, maintaining, providing, and enhancing our technology, products, and System, ensuring the security of the System, and to support our marketing activities.

In order to use the system, a Member may first complete the registration form. During registration, the Member will be required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We may use this information to contact the Member about services on our site for which the Member has expressed interest. The Member may also be asked for demographic information (such as information about the Member‘s industry, gender, or the company they represent), so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. If a Member chooses to enroll in our service, in certain circumstances the law may require us to collect the Members social security number or if a company, their EIN number. These numbers will be collected only if they are required to comply with IRS requirements.

A Member registering for a paid account will also be required to provide financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill the Member’s order. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the Member.

If you are a Member, we will use Personal Data that we gather about you to provide the requested services. In addition, if you have a free trial account, then we will use the Personal Data gathered about you to share more information about our business in an attempt to convince you to make a purchase from us or our associated companies.

##### Information We Collect Automatically

We store information that we automatically collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information such as device information and applications you use to access the System is tied to your Personal Data to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We may share your profile with other third parties as detailed in this policy. Your profile is shared together with your Personal Data. YOUR CREDIT CARD, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR EIN, AND OTHER PRIVATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS NEVER SHARED WITH ANY OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW OR FOR BILLING PURPOSES.

##### Cookies, click through and pixel tags

FocalPoint's website may use "cookies" and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, how much time is spent there and study traffic patterns on our website. This information can include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp, and referring/exit pages.

We may use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and keep track of advertisements or who may have referred you to our site.

FocalPoint and/or its Members may also use 3rd party vendor remarketing tracking pixels, or cookies. This means we may continue to show ads to you across the internet. The techniques our partners employ does not collect Personal Data such as your name, email address, postal address, or telephone number. 

If you prefer not to enable cookies, please check the help section of your preferred internet browser for instructions on how you can disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the FocalPoint website may not be available when cookies are disabled.

This information, which does not identify individual users, may be used to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around FocalPoint's sites and to gather miscellaneous demographic information about our visitors as a whole. While cookies may be used to display ads based on prior visits, FocalPoint will not collect information to market directly to that person.

In some of our email messages we use a "click-through" url link to content on the FocalPoint website. When customers click one of these url's, they pass through our web servers before arriving at the destination. FocalPoint may track this click-through data to help us measure interest in methods customers prefer to retrieve information and messages. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

FocalPoint may use pixel tags, which are tiny graphic images to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited.

##### Log Files

Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are only tied to Personal Data provided by a user when necessary to enable our Web-based service.

##### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons, Web Bugs, CSS, and similar functionality)

We may employ or our third-party advertising company(ies) may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. 

Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to users Personal Data. Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited www.companyX.com, which uses an advertising company’s clear gif, the Web site or advertising company would match the clear gifs identifier and the advertising company’s cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company or Web site.

In addition, we may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.

##### Usage Data

We may collect usage data about you whenever you interact with the System, which may include the dates and times that you access the System and your browsing activities (such as what portions of the System are used). We also collect information regarding the performance of the System, including metrics related to the deliverability of emails and other communications you send through the System. This information allows us to improve the content and operation of the System, and facilitate research and analysis of the System.
