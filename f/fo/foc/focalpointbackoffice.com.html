The System is operated and managed by FocalPoint, LLC., located in the State of New Jersey in the United States.</p>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">Because each account is controlled by an independent representative, we cannot guarantee how the System and your Personal Data will be managed by these representatives.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Registration</h5>
                <p class="in_tech">In order to use the system, a Member may first complete the registration form. During registration, the Member will be required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We may use this information to contact the Member about services on our site for which the Member has expressed interest. The Member may also be asked for demographic information (such as information about the Member‘s industry, gender, or the company they represent), so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. If a Member chooses to enroll in our service, in certain circumstances the law may require us to collect the Members social security number or if a company, their EIN number. These numbers will be collected only if they are required to comply with IRS requirements.</p>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">A Member registering for a paid account will also be required to provide financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration date).

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Cookies, click through and pixel tags</h5>
                <p class="in_tech">FocalPoint's website may use "cookies" and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, how much time is spent there and study traffic patterns on our website. This information can include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), operating system, date/time stamp, and referring/exit pages.</p>
                <p class="in_tech">We may use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and keep track of advertisements or who may have referred you to our site.</p>
                <p class="in_tech">FocalPoint and/or its Members may also use 3rd party vendor remarketing tracking pixels, or cookies. This means we may continue to show ads to you across the internet. The techniques our partners employ does not collect Personal Data such as your name, email address, postal address, or telephone number. </p>
                <p class="in_tech">If you prefer not to enable cookies, please check the help section of your preferred internet browser for instructions on how you can disable cookies. Please note that certain features of the FocalPoint website may not be available when cookies are disabled.</p>
                <p class="in_tech">This information, which does not identify individual users, may be used to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around FocalPoint's sites and to gather miscellaneous demographic information about our visitors as a whole. While cookies may be used to display ads based on prior visits, FocalPoint will not collect information to market directly to that person.</p>
                <p class="in_tech">In some of our email messages we use a "click-through" url link to content on the FocalPoint website. When customers click one of these url's, they pass through our web servers before arriving at the destination. FocalPoint may track this click-through data to help us measure interest in methods customers prefer to retrieve information and messages. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.</p>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">FocalPoint may use pixel tags, which are tiny graphic images to tell us what parts of our website customers have visited.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Log Files</h5>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are only tied to Personal Data provided by a user when necessary to enable our Web-based service.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons, Web Bugs, CSS, and similar functionality)</h5>
                <p class="in_tech">We may employ or our third-party advertising company(ies) may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. </p>
                <p class="in_tech">Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to users Personal Data. Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited www.companyX.com, which uses an advertising company’s clear gif, the Web site or advertising company would match the clear gifs identifier and the advertising company’s cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company or Web site.</p>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">In addition, we may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Usage Data</h5>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">We may collect usage data about you whenever you interact with the System, which may include the dates and times that you access the System and your browsing activities (such as what portions of the System are used). We also collect information regarding the performance of the System, including metrics related to the deliverability of emails and other communications you send through the System. This information allows us to improve the content and operation of the System, and facilitate research and analysis of the System.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech in_tech_imp"><u>Communications from the Site</u></h5>                
                <h5 class="redu_tech">Special Offers and Updates</h5>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">We send all new Members a welcome email. Established Members may occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Service Announcements</h5>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send Members an email. Members might not be able to opt-out of these communications, although they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Customer Service</h5>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">We also communicate with Members and others who contact us with questions and concerns on a regular basis to provide requested services, in regard to issues relating to their account, and to otherwise respond to inquiries. We reply via email or phone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>

		        <h5 class="redu_tech in_tech_imp"><u>Sharing with Third Parties</u></h5>
                <h5 class="redu_tech">Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h5>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any Personal Data.</p>

This is accomplished by using your information to direct to you information, offers, products, and/or services from us.

These companies only use your information for billing purposes and, to the extent they store your credit card or other private financial information, do so in a secure industry-standard fashion.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Service Providers</h5>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">We partner with other third parties to provide specific services.

These third parties are not allowed to use your Personal Data except for the purpose of providing these services and for purposes referenced in their privacy policies.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Approved Lead Vendors</h5>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">We may allow carefully-screened Approved Lead Vendors to be listed in a Member's back office. Under certain circumstances, we may share a Member's contact information with one or more of these Approved Lead Vendors. They may use this information to contact a Member via telephone, email or direct mail to inform a Member about an upcoming lead special, conference call or other promotional opportunity which could potentially benefit a Member.</p>

                <h5 class="redu_tech">Business Transitions</h5>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">In the event we go through a significant business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a major portion of its assets, your Personal Data will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. We will strive to notify you via email prior to a change of ownership or control of their Personal Data, consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>

When users make phone calls to or from telecommunication services provided by us, we may track information about the name, phone number, and other information about the call. We do not share this information, unless required to do so by law. We may use this information in the aggregate to analyze trends or to improve the service.

                <p class="in_tech">We use industry-standard good practices to protect our users Personal Data. When users submit Personal Data via the site, we strive to ensure that Personal Data is protected both online and off-line. However, please be aware that no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. When our registration/order form asks users to enter financial or other sensitive Personal Data (such as a credit card number and/or a social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard technology.</p>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">While we use industry-standard technology to protect sensitive information online, we also work to protect user-information off-line. All of our users information, not just the Personal Data mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to Personal Data. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store Personal Data are in a secure environment, in a secure facility.</p>

                <p class="in_tech">We will post any changes to this privacy statement in places that we deem appropriate. We will use Personal Data in accordance with the privacy policy under which the Personal Data was collected.</p>
                <p class="in_tech">If, however, we are going to use users Personal Data in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether we use their Personal Data in this different manner.</p>
                <p class="in_tech in_tech_imp">However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their Personal Data be used in this new manner. If we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect Personal Data already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice, we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
