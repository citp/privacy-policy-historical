<p><strong>DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our privacy policy </strong></p>

<p>FOCUS is committed to protecting your privacy. Any personal information we collect will be used in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable laws.</p>

<p>In this Data Protection and Privacy Policy references to "we" and "us" are to Focus.</p>

<p><strong>Control of personal information </strong></p>

<p>Any personal information provided to, or to be collected by, Focus is controlled primarily by Focus (DIY) Limited:</p>

<p>Contact details;</p>

<p>Registered office:<br>
Focus (DIY) Limited<br>
Gawsworth House<br>
Westmere Drive<br>
Crewe<br>
Cheshire<br>
CW1 6XB </p>

<p>Registered in England under no. 1779190</p>

<p>To contact us by telephone please ring 01270 501555<br>
To contact us by email please mail to info@Focusdiy.co.uk</p>

<p><strong>What information do we collect and how do we use it? </strong></p>

<p>We will only collect information about individuals, where it is specifically and knowingly provided, for example, at the time of registration or at the time of ordering. This data is referred to in this policy as 'personal information'.<br>
When you register or order, we collect personal information to process and fulfil your order(s). When you place an order we will carry out security checks to protect against fraudulent transactions.<br>
We will also collect information concerning your marketing preferences. In accordance with your preferences, we may contact you; with offers and information about our goods and services; for market research purposes and to enable carefully selected third parties to contact you with offers and information about their goods and services. The information we collect will also be used to help us review, develop and improve the products and services we offer. You may change your preferences contacting us by post, email or telephone.</p>

<p><strong>Will Focus share the information it receives?</strong> </p>

<p>We use third parties to carry out certain activities on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, carrying out surveys and installations, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.<br>
To protect against fraudulent transactions we may pass personal information to external agencies who will check the information we give them against public and private databases and may keep a record of such checks to use in future security checks.<br>
In accordance with the marketing preferences you select on this website or subsequently, we may share your personal information with carefully selected third parties so they may contact you with offers and information about their goods and services. You may change your preferences at any time by contacting us.<br>
We may share non-personal aggregate statistics (group) data about visitors to this site, sales and traffic patterns with connected group companies or other parties. However we do not sell or share any information about you as an individual user of this site unless you agree to us doing so.</p>

<p>Information may be transferred between Focus and its associated companies. Focus or relevant third parties transfer information to any country (including countries, which may not offer the same level of data protection as the UK). Although Focus takes steps to protect information within its possession, the nature of the Internet is such that the data may flow over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed and used by unauthorised persons.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong> </p>

<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser and help us to track visitors to our site, so we can better understand what portions of our site best serve you.<br>
Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to store items in your Shopping Basket between visits.<br>
Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to prevent this.<br>
It is not possible to purchase using www.Focusdiy.co.uk unless you have cookies turned on and we recommend that you leave them turned on.<br>
The 'help' portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. </p>

<p><strong>Links </strong></p>

<p>We may from time to time establish relationships with other companies that will enable you to access the web sites of such companies directly from our site. Each individual company operates its own policy regarding the sale of personal information and the use of cookies. If you have a particular interest or concern regarding the way your personal information will be used then you are advised to read the privacy statement on the relevant site.<br>
We will try to provide you with links to high quality, reputable sites which we believe will be of interest and relevant to you, but please note that such third party sites are not under our control and we do not contribute to the content of such sites. When you click through to these sites you leave the area controlled by Focus. We cannot accept responsibility for any issues arising in connection with either the third party's use of your data, the site content or the services offered to you by these sites.</p>

<p><strong>How does Focus protect customer information? </strong></p>

<p>When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.<strong></strong>
Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.<strong></strong>
It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you have finished using a shared computer.</p>

<p><strong>What choices do I have? </strong></p>

<p>You do not have to provide Focus with any of the information requested, however your computer will need to accept cookies to enable you to place orders with www.focusdiy.co.uk<strong></strong>
You may change your preferences by contacting us by post, email or telephone.</p>

<p><strong>Children </strong></p>

<p>Focus does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use www.focusdiy.co.uk only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>

<p><strong>How do I make a complaint to Focus?</strong> </p>

<p>Focus will undertake to handle a complaint fairly and competently. We will keep you informed either by telephone or email at each stage and will endeavour to fully resolve your complaint within 48 hours.
