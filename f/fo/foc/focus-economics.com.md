# Economic Forecats from FocusEconomics - About us

FocusEconomics is the sole owner of any personally identifiable information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. In order to use the FocusEconomics website, a user must not first complete a registration form. However, FocusEconomics collects information from our users at several different points on our website (such as the Newsletter Subscription Form, the FocusEconomics Consensus Forecast Information Request Form and the Comments and Suggestions Form). Said forms require the user to give their contact information (such as name and e-mail address). The information we are gathering from these forms will be used to monitor activity, such as who is visiting the site and how often it is being accessed. Furthermore, the information we collect from the forms is used to improve the content of our newsletters and website and is used to notify subscribers about updates to our website and product offering. It is optional for the user to provide any or all of the information, but we encourage the user to provide the information so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

**Order**

We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and e-mail). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. Any financial information (like credit card number and expiration date) provided in an actual order is processed through a secure server with our credit card processing company WorldPay Ltd. (see Security below). This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while the user is on our site. Once the user closes his browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, our provider of web analytics Google). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

The FocusEconomics site uses the services of Google for targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Google collects anonymous data through the use of cookies. To learn more about Google, including your ability to opt out of the Google system, go to [www.google.com/policies/privacy.](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our business partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. We do not make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site or receive our newsletter available to any third parties. For more information, please go to [www.worldpay.com/ ](http://www.worldpay.com/about_us/index.php?page=privacy&c=UK)

**Links**

The FocusEconomics website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that FocusEconomics is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

**Surveys**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and demographic information (such as country). Contact information will be used to notify the users of the survey results and the survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. Any financial information (like credit card number and expiration date) provided in an actual order is processed through a secure server with our credit card processing company WorldPay Ltd. All transactions are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) architecture (dependent on browser support). While on a secure page at WorldPay the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.   
We also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an e-mail to **security@focus-economics.com**

**Special Offers**

Established users will occasionally receive information on products, services and special offers. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

**Site and Service Updates**

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to new product offerings or content additions to our website.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by e-mailing our User Support **user@focus-economics.com**.

**Choice/Opt-out**

Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who order a product from us, but don’t want any marketing material, can keep their e-mail address off of our lists.  
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter(s) may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the newsletter and writing, “unsubscribe” in the subject line of the e-mail or e-mail us at info@focus-economics.com.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
