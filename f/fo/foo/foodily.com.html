Cookies are files that websites and online services create and access on your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your device. Our Service may use HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, Flash cookies and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage). Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies.  To learn more about some types of browser cookies, visit allaboutcookies.org.<br>
 You also may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash Website Storage Settings Manager by following Adobe’s instructions here (instructions vary depending on your operating system and version of Flash).

To control which Web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our Web pages called “Web beacons,” which are files that link Web pages to particular Web servers and their cookies.

<p>4. Analytics, Advertising and Do-Not-Track<br>
Online Analytics Providers<br>
To help us better understand your use of the Service, we may use third-party analytics on our Service, such as Google Analytics or Flurry. These third parties use the sorts of technologies described in the “Automatically Collected Information” section above. The information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. (We also may use these third parties’ technology as described in the following section.) To restrict Google Analytics’ handling of your information, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.  You also may visit <a href="http://www.flurry.com/legal-privacy/end-user-opt-out">Flurry’s Opt Out page</a> to restrict Flurry’s handling of your information.<br>
Advertising Technology Providers<br>
Data about your activities on our Service may be collected by advertising technology providers for use in delivering advertising (both online and offline) tailored to your individual characteristics, activities, interests and other factors.  These ad services may track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the automated technologies described above, and they may use this information, and other information they receive from us or other sources, to deliver advertisements to you.  We and third-party vendors may use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together, and other automated technologies, and in some cases additional information, (i) to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Service or other factors and (ii) to report how ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Service or other factors.  </p>
<p>You may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link, the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance “Your Online Choices” page or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link to opt out of receiving tailored advertising based on your Internet browsing activities from companies that participate in those programs.  Some of our advertising-related activities may involve the services of companies that do not participate in those programs.  To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.  The opt-outs apply only to the browser in which you set them.  For example, if you set the opt-out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt-out will not be active in Chrome. To opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt-out process.</p>
<p>The opt-outs described in this Privacy Policy do not block or delete cookies, or prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior. If you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising. Ads may be delivered based on other factors, such as the content of the web page in which they are shown, or demographic information obtained through other means. </p>
<p>Similar data collection takes place via our apps for advertising purposes.  In modern versions of Apple iOS, certain ad-related preferences that will be communicated to companies collecting data for in-app advertisements. For more information, or to use these mechanisms, consult your device settings.  Flurry also offers its own app-based advertising opt-out, which is described in the “Online Analytics Providers” above.<br>

These third parties may handle this information, and other information they directly collect through their technology, pursuant to their own privacy policies or practices.  We do not change our own collection of information in response to web browser “do-not-track” signals or other third-party tools that let consumers exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information.  Also, we generally do not require third parties collecting information on our websites and online services to respond to these technologies.  </p>
