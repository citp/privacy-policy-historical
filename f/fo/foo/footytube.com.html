      <p class="headline_med">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Site</p>
      <p><b>footy</b>tube allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the <b>footy</b>tube Site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the <b>footy</b>tube Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>

The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the <b>footy</b>tube Site, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
      <p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. <b>footy</b>tube's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
