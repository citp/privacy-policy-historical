**Privacy Policy**

Littlewoods Promotions Limited fully accept the privacy rights of individuals using this web site. Data collected on this site is kept secure. 

**1\. Registration Data**  
This data is used to enable us to set up an account for you to use for all your betting and gaming transactions. This allows us to check that you are over 18 years of age and that we have a valid address we can send prizes to where appropriate. It includes security questions which are used to allow us to renew your password if you forget it. 

**2\. Credit/Debit Card Data**  
This data is used to enable you to pay for betting and gaming transactions using a "virtual account". These details are used to verify the transactions with the banking systems. The credit card details are encrypted so that they cannot be interpreted by any external party when it is communicated to the banking systems. Your virtual account is used to store the balance of your account so that you know how much you have to play with. Your winnings are credited to this account and you can withdraw them back on to your credit card at any time. 

**3\. Financial Details**  
All financial transactions and betting and gaming transactions are stored so that you can view them in My Account. This data is only available to those people appointed to maintain it (such as those preparing financial accounts, or customer services to deal with any queries) and it is held on a secure database. 

**4\. Contact Information**  
If you select any of the contact boxes within the marketing area of the registration form, we will use your details to contact you in the event of a query, to send you prizes (where appropriate) or to send you news of products and services we can offer. If you do not select any of these boxes, we will only use your registration details to send you prizes (where appropriate) and will not send you news of products and services we can offer. 

At any time you can change this in your personal details, and if you receive any emails from us you will always have the option to unsubscribe so that you will no longer receive them. 

**5\. Cookies**  
A cookie is a bit of information that your browser stores on your computer at the request of a web server, and passes back to the web server that created the cookie every time you talk to that web server. It is created when a web server asks your client to store it. 

Cookies can only contain information that you've already sent to a given web site. 

Cookies can not otherwise discover information about you. A cookie is NOT something that looks at things on your computer, or examines your history, or anything like that. There may be other ways that a web server can find out information about you, but these work with or without cookies - they are unrelated. 

Cookies are only sent back to the web server that created them (unless your browser has a serious bug). Cookies can't leak information from a site you trust to a site that you don't trust. Cookies only store information and the only site able to retrieve it is the site that created the cookie. 

Our sites use cookies for a number of reasons, these are: 

  * To store information about whether the user has the flash player installed or not
  * To store the date and time of you visiting the site. This lets us limit the times a promotional popup appears when you load the site, saving a lot of annoyance. 



If at any time, you wish to get rid of these cookies, you can do so by following these instructions on these external sites: 

  * **[Internet Explorer](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q278835)**
  * **[Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/options#privacy)**

**6\. Exclusions**  
We may disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with any legal process served on us, (2) protect our rights or property. If, in our sole determination, you are found to have cheated or attempted to defraud the Company or any other user of our service in any way including, but not limited to, game manipulation or payment fraud, or if we suspect you of fraudulent payment, including use of stolen bank cards/credit cards, or any other fraudulent activity, we reserve the right to share this information (together with your identity) with other online gaming sites, banks, credit card companies, and appropriate agencies.
