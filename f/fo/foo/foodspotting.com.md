**I.                ****INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE**

“Personal information” is data that identifies, relates to, describes, can be used to contact, or could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you. For purposes of this Policy, there is no meaningful distinction between the terms “personal information” and “personal data.”

·       **Other information you may provide** (including other information you provide about yourself or others through our Services or to which you provide us with access via third-party platforms)

You may choose not to provide some of the personal information described above. Please note, however, that many of our Services require some personal information to operate, so if you choose not to provide the personal information necessary to operate and provide you with a particular Service or feature of that Service, you may not be able to use that Service or feature. 

We do not proactively collect sensitive personal information, such as health-related information. However, our Services include text boxes that are designed for you to describe certain details about your dining preferences that you want us or restaurants to know. Please be aware that information you freely submit in these boxes may reveal to us or to the restaurants or restaurant affiliates with which we or they share information (as detailed in the How We Share Your Information section, below) certain information that may be considered sensitive personal information under applicable law (for example, about any allergies or dietary restrictions). We do not use this information for the purpose of marketing or advertising products to you. Sensitive personal information you voluntarily submit is processed on the basis of your consent, which you may revoke at any time by contacting us at the details set out in the How to Contact Us section below.

**Personal Information Generated By Us.** As you use our Services, we generate certain personal information about you, including through automatic data collection and by inferences based on the information we collect about you and your activity.  We may automatically collect information about your interactions with the Services or communications you receive (such as email) using certain technologies, such as cookies, web beacons and other technologies (see our [Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising Policy](https://www.opentable.com/legal/cookie-policy?updated_201805=true&lang=en) for more details). We generate the following categories of personal information about you: ****

·       **Device information.** When you visit or use our Services, we automatically collect certain information about your device (e.g., your mobile device, computer, or tablet), including information about your hardware and software, device configuration, and nearby networks. Such data may include data about your device operating systems, browsers, and other software installed on your device; device identifiers, such as IP address, IMEI number, MAC address, or other device identifier; country of origin, region and language settings; and information about domain servers and wireless or network access points near your device.

For example, we may receive this information when you select restaurant search locations, enter your local dining city in your account profile, when you are in proximity to certain beacons, choose to publish your location in reviews you leave for restaurants on the Services, or in your comments or other communications with us. We may use and store this information to provide and improve features of our Services, for example, to tailor our Services on a needs-based manner to better facilitate your requests and to provide you with more relevant content about restaurants in your dining city or cities you visit. Please see the Your Rights and Choices section below for more information about how to adjust your preferences, including those related to location information. ****

·       **Inferences about you.** We combine the information we collect, generate, or otherwise obtain to draw inferences about your preferences and interests in order to provide and personalize our Services and tailor the offers we and our partners provide to you. ****

**Personal Information We Obtain from Third Parties.** We may also receive certain categories of personal information from third parties, such as third-party websites, applications, social media networks, and services (which may include publicly-available sources; each of these is a “ **third-party platform** ”), our group companies, restaurants, and other third parties, including individuals who have added you as a guest to their reservation. If you are an existing OpenTable customer, we will combine this information with information we collect through our Services and use and share it for the purposes described below. The categories of personal information we may obtain from third parties include: ****

·       **Your name**

·       **Email address or other contact information**

·       **Social media data,** if you connect to our Services using a social media third-party platform or interact with OpenTable by liking or commenting on our social media pages or content, or if any of your social media data is available to the public, we may receive information from that social media third-party platform or a third-party service about those interactions and your profile

·       **Browsing, usage and advertising details,** including how you use our Services and/or third-party websites, applications, and services; and information relating to your interactions with our advertising and marketing materials

·       **Purchase Information,** including information from point-of-sale devices at certain participating restaurants (such as items ordered, bill total, and time spent at the restaurant), information about travel accommodations and bookings you make through our group companies (for example, if you book a hotel stay through one of our group companies, we may receive the general location of your accommodations and use that information to provide nearby restaurant recommendations); or purchase information for other business partners and affiliates, such as food delivery partners

·       **Information from restaurants,** including information that certain participating restaurants provide us about diners (for example, if you eat at a hotel restaurant as a hotel guest, restaurants are able to flag that you are a guest at that hotel, or if you eat at a chain of restaurants, those restaurants can flag whether you have a loyalty card or other information about interactions with those restaurants)

**II.               ****HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION**

We use your personal information for the following purposes (“ **Purposes** ”), to:

·       **Provide the Services** , which includes providing you with the services, products, and functionality offered through our Services and fulfilling your requests, including but not limited to: making reservations, reviewing restaurants, paying for services or events, joining waitlists, and notifying people you add to or notify of your restaurant reservations through the Services

·       **Authenticate your credit or debit card account information**

·       **Tailor your experience with our Services,** such as by making inferences or combining different pieces of information we have collected about you to suggest restaurants that you may be interested in or otherwise tailor our Services to you according to your preferences or restrictions. For example, if you frequently search for or book Italian restaurants or restaurants with outdoor seating in your home city, we may prioritize Italian restaurants with outdoor seating in your search results when you look for reservations in another city 

·       **Provide you more relevant advertising on and off our Services,** including to show you personalized offers on and off our Services. For example, if you frequently search for or book reservations at Italian restaurants in a particular city, we may display advertising for a local Italian restaurant to you on our Services or work with our business partners to display advertisements for local Italian restaurants to you on other websites you visit

·       **Protect against, investigate, and deter fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity**

·       **Comply with our policies, procedures and legal obligations** , including complying with law enforcement or government authority requests, addressing litigation-related issues, and exercising rights or obligations conferred by law

·       **As otherwise consented to by you and as required or permitted by applicable law**. If you give your consent to any further use of personal information, you can withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us using the details set out below.

You have choices about your personal information, and in some circumstances, you may have the right to opt-out or object to our uses of your personal information for these Purposes. For more information, or to exercise these or other rights (where available), see the Your Choices and Rights section below.

**Electronic Communications** **.** Consistent with the above Purposes and as permitted by applicable law, we may communicate with you via electronic messages, including email, text message, or mobile push notification to: 

·       **Send you information relating to our products and Services.** This may include reservation and waitlist confirmations, reminders and updates, receipts, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages.

·       **Send you marketing communications.**  In other situations, subject to the Your Choices and Rights section below and applicable law, we may communicate with you about contests, offers, promotions, rewards, upcoming events, and other news about products and Services offered by OpenTable, our group companies, restaurants, and other business partners. 

With your consent, where required, we may contact you at the mobile phone number that you provide to us by way of direct dial calls, autodialed and prerecorded message calls, text messages and push notifications in connection with the above Purposes. 

**Our Role as Data Controller and Data Processor** **.** For purposes of European Union law and similar data protection regimes, we generally act as a data controller, meaning we determine the purposes and means of processing your personal information through our Services. Under certain OpenTable programs, however, restaurants may engage us to provide them with certain processing services related to information owned or controlled by the restaurant. We seek assurances from restaurants that they will process information in accordance with applicable laws, but we are not responsible for any restaurant's use of information (including information used by its affiliates and service providers) for which it is an owner or controller. To learn more about how a restaurant may use such information, you should review its privacy notice. 

**Processing Bases and Consequences.** When we process your personal information, we rely on the following legal bases:

·       **Performance of the contract we have with you** (such as if you use our Services to make a restaurant reservation, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer your reservation by sharing your information with the appropriate restaurant).

·       **Compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject** (such as tax obligations, and when we are obliged to comply with lawful requests from competent authorities such as law enforcement).

·       **To serve our legitimate interests** (such as tailoring your experience with our Services, carrying out online advertising, and for fraud detection), provided that such processing does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. The processing may also be pursuant to other applicable legal bases for data processing especially provisions set out under local law.

Where we use personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we take steps to ensure that your rights with respect to your personal information are not infringed. You can contact us using the details set out in the How to Contact Us section below for more information about the steps we take to ensure these rights are not infringed. You also have the right to object to such processing as described in the Your Choices and Rights section below.

·       **Consent.** To the extent that a legal ground described above would not apply to processing of your personal information by us, we will seek your consent for such specific purpose in accordance with applicable law (such as sending direct marketing messages by electronic means, like email, without an exception from the requirement to obtain consent).

**Aggregate Information.** We aggregate personal information collected directly from you, information generated about you by us, and information obtained from third parties (with your consent, where required) with personal information collected about other users in order to produce general statistics that cannot be linked to you or any other specific user. Information that has been aggregated and de-identified is no longer considered “personal information” and may be subsequently used for any purpose.

**Anonymized Information.** We may process information that cannot be linked to you or any other specific user using any means available to us, either because it was collected anonymously or has been subsequently anonymized. Information that is anonymous or has been anonymized is no longer considered “personal information” and may be subsequently used for any purpose.

We disclose the personal information we collect (or otherwise generate or obtain) as follows:

·       **With restaurants and restaurant affiliates.** We share your information with restaurants and their affiliates **** to provide the Services (such as connecting diners with restaurants to make an online reservation and sharing your dining activity and history, preferences, requests, restrictions, and other information with the restaurant) and for the restaurant or restaurant group’s own purposes, which may include marketing or advertising purposes **** (see below for more detail on Sharing with Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates).

**Sharing with Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates** **as a controller of your personal information.** When you make a request through our Services or through a restaurant, such as a restaurant reservation, joining a restaurant waitlist, making a payment to a restaurant through our Services, purchasing an event ticket, or if you are a guest of the person making the request, we necessarily provide certain categories of your information to the restaurant to facilitate that request. For requests to dine, this information may include your name, profile, time and date of visit, party size, your phone number, your dining preferences, guest information, any special requests, information or comments that you choose to submit (if any), and your email address.

If you provide a mobile phone number in connection with your request, restaurants may send you text messages regarding your request. Some restaurants also require you to provide credit or debit card account information to secure your reservation. When you make a reservation at a restaurant that is part of a restaurant group, we may also share additional information about your dining activity at that restaurant or restaurant group in the past, your dining preferences and/or information that we collect from you and third parties that may be relevant to that reservation.

In addition to providing you with more customized Services, we may receive certain information from participating restaurants from their Point of Sale terminals that we analyze to provide aggregate information to the restaurant about their customers.

We also share with restaurants summary reports of feedback from diners. If you provide comments about a restaurant through our Services, these comments may be shared with or may be accessible by that restaurant, and the restaurant may respond to you. We will not tie your comments with other information that can identify you directly, but a restaurant may be able to tell who you are from your comments, particularly if you give your name in the comments or provide contact information, such as an email address.

**Sharing with Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates as a processor or service provider on their behalf.** We act as a processor or service provider for Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates in certain circumstances as described above (see above for more detail on Our Role as Data Controller and Data Processor). In providing these services, we may, at the direction of the restaurant, share certain of your information with the restaurant’s affiliated restaurants (such as affiliated brands), restaurant group and/or restaurants with the same brand or parent-brand (collectively, such restaurant’s “ **restaurant group** ”), or other entities associated with the restaurant (such as the parent entity of the restaurant group or affiliated hotels) and/or their service providers (collectively, the associated entities and service providers, the restaurant’s " **restaurant affiliates** ") under OpenTable’s programs for the following purposes:

·       **Customized services** : restaurants may share your information (such as meal or seating preferences or special occasions) with their restaurant affiliates and restaurant group to enhance the hospitality the restaurant group provides you when you dine with them (such as trying to seat you by a window, if you previously expressed a preference for window seating).

**Sharing with Our** **Group Companies.** We share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries in the U.S. and worldwide, as well as with our parent corporation, Booking Holdings Inc., and its other subsidiaries (collectively, as also defined earlier in this Privacy Policy, “our group companies”). We may share your information with our group companies for the following reasons:

·       Provide you with integrated services (including to administer and manage reservations, purchases, services, and payments across our affiliated platforms).

·       Provide personalized offers or send you marketing communications with your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.

·       Enable “single sign-on”, i.e., allowing you to log into a shared account for multiple Booking Holdings Inc. brands using a single set of log-in credentials, which allows us to, for example, show your purchases and bookings made through the websites, applications, and services of our group companies on your account page, and allows our group companies to show information in your respective account(s) with them.

·       Provide customer support services.

·       Detect, prevent, and investigate fraud and misuse of our services, other illegal activities, and data breaches.

·       Analyze how users use our independent and affiliated platforms, including so that we may improve existing products and services and develop new features, products, and services that may be of interest to our users.

·       Ensure compliance with applicable law.

To learn more about your choices related to how we share your information with our group companies, please see the Your Choices and Rights section below.

**Sharing with Our Business Partners** **.** We share your information with other third-party business partners for their own marketing purposes. These third parties include online advertisers or ad tech companies, who may provide you with targeted advertising and marketing communications, where permitted under law. The information we share includes information collected through your use of our Services (e.g., bookings, reservations, or other purchases) and information we collect about you through the use of cookies and similar technologies (e.g., information about the websites you visit; information about your searches, including the cities or neighborhoods you search in, the type of restaurant or cuisine you searched for, price range, intended dining date, and the number of diners). 

For example, if you frequently book reservations at Italian restaurants, we use that information to help a particular Italian-themed restaurant group offer you a promotion.

To learn more about your choices related to how we share your information with our business partners, please see the Your Choices and Rights section below.

**Sharing with Social Networking Services** **.**   Our Services allow you to connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information publicly or with friends. Our Services may also allow you to connect with us on, share on, and use third-party platforms, including those on which OpenTable has a presence. Please be mindful of your personal privacy needs and the privacy needs of others as you choose whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with others. OpenTable also does not control the privacy practices of third-party platforms. Please contact those sites and services directly to learn about their privacy practices. ****

**Sharing to Process Payment Information** **.** To use certain Services (such as to make reservations at certain restaurants; to make payments to certain restaurants or to secure reservations; and to purchase tickets to events, or other products or services), we require credit or debit card account information. When you submit your credit or debit card account information through our Services, we share that information with restaurants, third-party payment processors, and other third-party service providers (including, but not limited to, vendors who provide fraud detection services to us and other third parties) to the extent necessary to meet our contractual obligations to you (e.g., to secure your reservation or make a payment to a restaurant where required), to meet our legitimate interests in preventing fraud and other misuse of our platforms, or with your consent where this is required by law. In particular:

·       When you use a credit or debit card to secure a reservation through our Services, we provide your credit or debit card account information (including card number and expiration date, but excluding the CVV number) to our third-party payment service providers and the applicable restaurant.

·       When you initially provide your credit or debit card account information through our Services in order to use our restaurant payment services, we provide your credit or debit card account information to our third-party payment service providers. As explained in the OpenTable Terms of Use, these third parties may store your credit or debit card account information so you can use our restaurant payment services through our Services in the future, to the extent permitted by local law.

·       For information about the security of your credit or debit card account information, see the How We Store and Protect Your Information section below.

**Sharing with Other Service Providers** **.** We share information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who perform services or functions on our behalf (e.g., hosting or operating our Services, data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, site analytics, data analysis, delivering marketing messages and advertisements, processing credit card payments, and providing fraud detection services). We do not authorize these third parties to use or disclose your information for purposes other than for which it has been provided. We require these third parties to maintain and implement security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or processing.

**IV.             ****HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

OpenTable maintains commercially-reasonable technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

When your credit or debit card account information is being transmitted to our Services or through our Services, it will be protected by cryptographic protocols. To be clear, OpenTable does not itself store your credit or debit card account information, and we do not have direct control over or responsibility for your credit or debit card account information. We use third party payment processors that are the controllers of your credit card information. Our contracts with third parties that receive your credit or debit card account information require them to keep it secure and confidential.

However, we cannot guarantee that transmissions of your credit or debit card account information or your other information will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat the security measures taken by OpenTable or our third-party service providers. Except to the extent that liability cannot be excluded or limited due to applicable law, we assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our control.
