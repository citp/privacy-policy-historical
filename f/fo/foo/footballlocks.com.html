<b>Most pro football handicappers &amp; sports betting fans don't succeed making NFL picks
over the long run because they use NFL gambling information and NFL betting stats already
factored into Las Vegas pro football lines when making their
NFL football picks &amp; predictions each week...</b><br>
Football<i>LOCKS</i>.com has a different approach to making NFL betting picks.
We use our innovative
<a href="http://www.FootballLOCKS.com/about.shtml#ABOUT">Backwards
Odds Handicapping</a> of Las Vegas NFL odds &amp; NFL point spreads to look for
possible indications in the weekly NFL line as to which teams Las Vegas
<i>sports odds makers</i> may think will cover the spread. 
<br>If you're placing
NFL bets or playing in a pool, see if you increase your NFL gambling success with a bet on
Football<i>LOCKS</i>.com's NFL weekly picks &amp; predictions. 
<br>While week to week NFL game picks at Football<i>LOCKS</i>.com are not
full blown free sports picks, we think you'll see by our packages
that you're practically getting our NFL expert picks free.
