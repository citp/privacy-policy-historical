You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

When you post a message, your Foodzie ID or alias is visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Foodzie may be required to disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Foodzie Terms of Use. Foodzie may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in compliance with Foodzie's Copyright and Intellectual Property Policy, as Foodzie in Foodzie's sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, Foodzie may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email address and company name. Foodzie may share aggregated demographic information with business partners.

Foodzie is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them. These businesses may operate stores on the Foodzie website or sell items to you from the Foodzie website. Foodzie may also provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. Due to the nature of Foodzie's business model, when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, you will share customer information that is related to such transaction with that affiliated business.

Foodzie employs other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and needs to share your information with them to provide products and services to you. Examples include but are not limited to fulfilling orders, handling billing disputes, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service.

Foodzie will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy to provide products or services you have requested or when Foodzie has your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Foodzie's Terms of Use, as specified in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. In some cases, Foodzie may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Foodzie will transfer information about you if Foodzie is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Foodzie will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Foodzie web site before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another Foodzie user's email address, shipping address and/or other information. Pursuant to Foodzie's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use this information. This information should only be used for Foodzie-related communications or for Foodzie-facilitated transactions. Foodzie has not granted you a license to use the information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without express consent from the user, you are not licensed to add any Foodzie user to your email or physical mail list.

## Forums

If you use a forum on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by others or could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Foodzie is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

## Third Parties

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information Foodzie collects from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are buyers or sellers on Foodzie or throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Foodzie does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. Foodzie is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the Foodzie site. Foodzie encourages you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. Your Foodzie account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) for registration Foodzie encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Foodzie follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Foodzie receives it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while Foodzie strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, Foodzie cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on Foodzie's Web site, you can email Foodzie at [support@foodzie.com](mailto:support@foodzie.com).
