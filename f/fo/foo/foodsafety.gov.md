## Privacy Policy for The FDA/CFSAN VM Web Site

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**

When you visit the "vm.cfsan.fda.gov" (aka "www.cfsan.fda.gov") web site, if you do nothing during your visit but browse through the web site, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally. We automatically collect and store only the following aggregated general information about your visit: 

  * the pages you visit, 
  * the date and time you access our site, 
  * the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are coming from an America Online account, or purdue.edu if you are connecting from Purdue University's domain), 
  * the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site, and 
  * your operating system and browser. 



We use this information 

  * to measure the number of visitors to the different food and nutrition sections of our site, 
  * to help us make our site more useful 
  * to develop and code content pages so that most people will be able to view the pages correctly. 



**If You Send Us Personal Information**

If you choose to provide us with personal information, as in an e-mail message or by filling out a form, we store the question and e-mail address information so that we can answer the question that was sent in, and send the answer back to the e-mail or other address or phone provided. If you send us a comment, we relay the comment to the most appropriate program manager in the agency. If enough questions or comments come in that are the same, the question may be added to our Question and Answer section, or the suggestions may be used to guide the design of our Web site. Unless otherwise required by statute, we do not identify publicly who sends questions or comments into our web site. 

**Children's Privacy**

We collect no information from children under 13. If a child sends us an e-mail inquiry or comment, we answer, then delete the e-mail from our files. 

**CFSAN Listservs**

If you subscribe to a CFSAN Listserv, CFSAN considers your e-mail address confidential and it will not be released under FOI. For your convenience, you can subscribe to other government and non-government Listservs from our site. Each Listserv has its own privacy policy which you should check prior to subscribing. 

## Disclosure

FDA does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or by statute. We will only use personally identifying information to respond to you or to help us perform our public health duties. In those cases, various people may see the personal information you provide in order to look into the matter you inquired about.

We may enter the information you send into an electronic database, to share with our attorneys and investigators involved in law enforcement or policy-making. We may also share it with other government agencies that have public health or consumer protection duties. FDA or any of those agencies may contact you. In other limited circumstances, including requests from Congress or private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit.

Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If you are worried because your communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information such as your social security number, you can send it by postal mail instead.

## Disclaimer of Endorsement

**Links to Other Sites**

Our web site has links to many other federal agencies, and in a few cases we link to private organizations. If you access another site through a link we provide, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.
