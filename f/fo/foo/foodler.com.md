# Privacy Policy | Foodler

## Information Collection

We collect information volunteered by consumers when they register and place orders on our Web site. The information we collect through registration and order placement is used to provide the services specified on our Web site. We store information such as page views, computer IP addresses and other statistics in the form of logs. These logs are used solely to enhance the technical performance of our Web site.

## Information Sharing

In order to process your food order, we must share the following information every time you place an order with a restaurant: your name, e-mail address, delivery address, phone number, food order and credit card information (if applicable).

## Customer Communication

Our customer service representatives may use your telephone number or e-mail address to notify you of the status of your order as necessary and appropriate. We do not share your information with any third parties, except the local restaurant as stated above.

## E-mail

We do not purchase bulk e-mail addresses nor do we use the services of bulk e-mail companies for promoting our service. This means we will not distribute, sell or rent your e-mail address to any third party except local restaurants. Additionally, our e-mail servers do not relay e-mail destined for non-local domains.

## Cookies

We use "cookies" (small text files stored in your internet browser) to enhance your ordering experience. Cookies allow our users to order faster and more efficiently by storing information such as your email address. We do not use cookies to track your surfing habits and activities outside of our Web site. Cookies can be easily and safely deleted from your system. See you browser's help section for instructions.

## Security Information

We always use industry standard encryption technologies, such as 128 bit SSL encryption, when transferring and receiving private consumer data on our site. This information can only be translated once it's received by our secure servers. These secure servers help to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you through our Web site.

## Policy Changes

If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should periodically check this section of our Web site.
