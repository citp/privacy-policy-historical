Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

By engaging with our website you acknowledge you have read and understood this privacy policy.

For the purposes of European Economic Area data protection law, (the “Data Protection Law”), the data controller is: The Motley Fool Limited, 5 New Street Square, London, EC4A 3TW United Kingdom ([dpo@fool.co.uk](mailto:dpo@fool.co.uk)).

### 1\. The information we collect about you

We will collect and process the following personal data from you:

#### 1.1 Information you give us

This is information about you that you give us directly when you interact with us.

  1. **Signing Up for Content Delivered via Email:**  When you sign up for a report or other content delivered by email, we will ask for your email address. We may also ask for your name as well as capturing your IP address.
  2. **Subscribing to a Share Tipping Service:**  When subscribing to any of our share tipping services, we need to know the sort of information typically used for credit card transactions, such as your name, address, telephone number, and credit card number and expiration date. We encrypt all of this information using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) technology.
  3. **Other Services:**  We may also ask for additional information when providing special, personalised services. If you don’t want to provide the information requested, you certainly don’t have to, but you will not be able to take advantage of such offerings. For example, if we launch a text alert feature, we wouldn’t be able to send you any alerts unless you provide us with your mobile number. On occasion, we may also ask you for other personal information in connection with surveys, sweepstakes or other promotional offers running on our site but again, your participation in these features is purely voluntary.



#### 1.2 Information we collect about you from using our site:

  1. While on our site, we automatically log certain information about how you’re using our site. This information may include the URL that you just came from, your IP address (or a partially anonymised IP address) and the pages you visit while on our site.
  2. We may place a pixel on pages on our site, or those of our advertisers and partners. This enables us to record in our server logs that a specific user ID has visited a particular page. This data allows us to analyse and determine our audience’s behavioural characteristics, which helps us to optimise our site, advertisement placement, and marketing focus.



#### 1.3 Information we receive from other sources:

We allow our partners to collect certain information when you visit our site. They may utilize cookies, pixels, beacons, or other technologies to collect and use information about you during your visit to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements they feel you would like.

To learn more about this behavioural advertising, including information on how to opt-out, please visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance, at [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/), the Networking Advertising Initiative at [www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and the Information  Commissioner’s Office, <https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/>.

### 2\. The legal bases we rely on

The law on data protection sets out a number of different reasons for which we may collect and process your personal data in certain circumstances, including:

#### 2.1 Consent

We can collect and process your data with your consent.

  * For example, if you have given your consent to receiving marketing material from us at the point we collected your information.



#### 2.2 Contractual obligations

We need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligations.

  * For example, where you have provided us with your email address to receive our services, we will use this information in order to effectively deliver and communicate our services.



#### 2.3 Legal compliance

If the law requires us to, we may need to collect and process your data.

  * For example, we can pass on details of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity to applicable law enforcement.



#### 2.4 Legitimate interest

We may require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way which might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.

  * For example, it is in our legitimate interests to ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and your computer and we provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us.



### 3\. How we use your information

We will use this information in our legitimate interests, where we have considered these are not overridden by your rights:

  * To administer our site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes.
  * To keep our site safe and secure.
  * For measuring or understanding the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you.
  * To keep you informed about products and services similar to the ones you subscribe to.
  * To improve our site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.
  * To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.
  * Internal research: Cookies (which are discussed further below) and the other information we automatically track, are used to help us better understand how our audience uses our site as well as for internal research on users’ demographics and interests.



### 4\. Our promotional updates and communications

Where permitted by one of the legal bases above, we will use your personal information for marketing analysis and to provide you with promotional update communications by email about our products/services and those of our business partners.

You can object to further marketing at any time by: (i) checking and updating your contact details within your account page (<https://www.fool.co.uk/account/>); (ii) selecting the “unsubscribe” link at the end of all our marketing and promotional update communications to you; or (iii) sending us an email to [CustomerServices@fool.com](mailto:CustomerServices@fool.com).

### 5\. Where your information is stored

The data that we collect from you is transferred to, and may be stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) that is not subject to equivalent Data Protection Law. For our purposes, the information we collect is processed by our parent company, The Motley Fool, LLC (“Fool US”) in the United States of America and some of this data is stored in the US.

We may transfer your personal information outside the EEA:

  * In order to store it.
  * In order to enable us to provide goods or services to you and fulfil our contract with you. This includes order fulfilment, processing of payment details, and the provision of support services.
  * Where we are legally required to do so.
  * In order to facilitate the operation of our group of businesses, where it is in our legitimate interests and we have concluded these are not overridden by your rights.



Where your information is transferred outside the EEA, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is subject to appropriate safeguards, such as relying on a recognised legal adequacy mechanism, and that it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

### 6\. How long we keep your information

We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil any legal obligations we may have as well as for purposes of processing your information (for example, if you continue to subscribe to one of our services, we will need your information to deliver the service to you). We may also retain aggregate information beyond this time for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services. You cannot be identified from aggregate information retained or used for these purposes.
