## The Information We Collect

  * **Registration:** When you register with the Fool we ask for your email address. We also capture your IP address.
  * **Signing Up for Content Delivered via Email:** When you sign up for a report or other content delivered by email, we will ask for your email address. We may also ask for your name as well as capture your IP address.
  * **Subscribing to a Share Tipping Service:** When subscribing to any of our share tipping services, we need to know the sort of information typically used for credit card transactions, such as your name, address, telephone number, and credit card number and expiration date. We encrypt all of this information using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) technology. 
  * **Emailing an Article or Message Board Post:** If you use our service to email an article or post to a friend, you will need to provide us with your friend's email address. The Motley Fool will automatically send this person a one-time email, attaching the recommended article as well as inviting them to visit and register with our site. We will not use these email addresses for any other purpose.
  * **My Scorecard:** If you enter stocks into My Scorecard, we will save that information, and use it to identify content that we think is relevant to you. We will also use that information in the aggregate to help us understand what our members are interested in, so we can create and target our content better.
  * **Other Services:** We may also ask for additional information when providing special, personalised services. If you don't want to give us the information requested, you certainly don't have to, but you will not be able to take advantage of such offerings. For example, if we launch a text alert feature, we wouldn’t be able to send you any alerts unless you provide us with your mobile number. On occasion, we may also ask you for other personal information in connection with surveys, sweepstakes or other promotional offers running on our site but again, your participation in these features are purely voluntary.
  * **Information We Automatically Track:**
    * While on our site, we automatically log certain information about how you're using our site. This information may include the URL that you just came from, your IP address and the pages you visit while on our site.
    * The Motley Fool may place a pixel on pages on our site, or those of our advertisers and partners. This enables us to record in our server logs that a specific user id has visited a particular page. This data allows us to analyse and determine our audience's behavioural characteristics, which helps us to optimise our site, advertisement placement, and marketing focus. Only anonymous, non-personally identifiable information is collected, and it cannot, by itself or in combination, be tracked to a specific individual.



## Our Use of Your Information

  * **More Customised Service:** The Motley Fool collects personal information to provide you, the user, with the best and most personalised web experience possible and to provide our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. In short, by knowing a little about you, The Motley Fool can deliver more relevant content and advertisements to you while at our web site and thus, provide you with a more efficient, customised and seamless experience when using our services.
  * **Internal Research:** Cookies (which are discussed further below) and the other information we automatically track are used to help us better understand how our audience uses our site as well as for internal research on users' demographics and interests.
  * **To Confirm Your Registration:** Once you've registered, we will send you a confirmation email acknowledging your new account to the address that you supplied to us.
  * **To Contact You:** If you have given us permission to do so, or otherwise consented to us contacting you, we may subsequently send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may interest you. Only The Motley Fool will send you these notices. If you change your mind and do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can let us know on our [Email Unsubscribe page](https://www.fool.co.uk/secure/members/edit/freemailsubscribe.aspx), or via email to [UK Privacy](mailto:ukprivacy@fool.co.uk) or send snail mail to: Privacy at The Motley Fool, 60 Charlotte Street, London, W1T 2NU. We'll remove your name from our lists as soon as we can. Another way is to simply to click the [unsubscribe link](https://www.fool.co.uk/secure/members/edit/freemailsubscribe.aspx) found in our email messages or untick the “the "Email" box in the "How we communicate with you" section of the ['Manage your Fool UK email subscriptions'](https://www.fool.co.uk/secure/members/edit/freemailsubscribe.aspx) page.

If you follow these links from our site to theirs, you should be aware that these other sites have their own privacy and data processing practices. The Motley Fool has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding a site and its privacy policies including its use of cookies, check that site.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

The Motley Fool does not give, rent, lend or sell individual information to any third party. Furthermore, we will not disclose any information about individual users, except as described below.

  * **Fool Community:** On our boards (and anywhere else on our site), you are publicly identified by your user or screen name. If you choose your full name as your username, you have voluntarily disclosed that information to the Fool community. Similarly, any information you provide in your public profile is for public consumption. The same is true for any personal identifiable information (such as an email address) you include in any message board posts. Also, if you choose to email one of our articles to someone or email a reply to a message board post (as opposed to posting the reply on the boards), your email address will be revealed to whoever opens and reads the email. Other users may also use this function and email you a response to a message you've posted on our boards. While you will be able to see the sender's email address, the sender will not be able to see yours. However, should you respond to the message, you will have disclosed your email address to the message's recipient(s).
  * **Current or Prospective Advertisers/Partners:** We only provide aggregate, non-identifiable information to our current and prospective advertisers and business partners. For example, we might tell advertisers that there are 120,000 Registered Fools in Metropolis, but we won't tell them that the user called 'Superman' is one of them, and we definitely won't tell them that his email address is ckent@dailyplanet.com.
  * **Our Parent Company:** As previously mentioned, the information we collect from our users is processed and stored by our parent company in the United States. Also, since our parent handles the distribution of some of our emails for us, we provide our users' email addresses to Fool US for the sole purpose of delivering these publications. Unless you've registered with Fool US or have otherwise provided them with your email address, they will not be contacting you or otherwise using your email address for any Fool US-related purposes.
  * **Third Party Service Providers:** We may employ the services of third party providers to aid us in certain aspects of our operations (such as the distribution of our email products or conducting a survey for us). Depending on the services performed, some of these providers may be provided with user information. These contractors would be subject to confidentiality agreements which limit their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through their relationship with the Fool to Fool-related business only, consistent with this policy.
  * **Legal Requests:** The Motley Fool may disclose your personally identifiable information to protect the rights and property of the Fool as well as to comply with any applicable law or valid legal process. This includes, but is not limited to: 
    * Requests by Government Agencies. We will disclose any information we have in our possession to law enforcement or government officials in response to any inquiry or investigation or if in our sole discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in connection with any investigation or activity that is or may be illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.
    * Disclosures we are legally required or entitled to make under any enactment, rule of law or by the order of a court.



## Security

The Motley Fool is committed to protecting your personal information. All information that you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Access to personalised areas of the site, such as My Fool and My Scorecard is password-protected for your privacy and security. While we do our best to protect your personal information, The Motley Fool cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. What does all this mean? Just as in the investing world, you must protect yourself. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. If you need to change your password, please follow the steps outlined below.

## Editing Your Information or Closing Your Account

You have the ability to edit your information and preferences at any time, including whether you want us to contact you about our various products and services. If you would rather not hear from us, you can opt out of all contact using the ['Manage your Fool UK email subscriptions'](https://www.fool.co.uk/secure/members/edit/freemailsubscribe.aspx) page. Another way is to simply to click the [unsubscribe link](https://www.fool.co.uk/secure/members/edit/freemailsubscribe.aspx), which you will find in our email messages.

If you want to correct or change the information in your Profile, or any other information we have about you, please go to <http://boards.fool.co.uk/editsettings.asp>. You will either be able to make your changes right there, or we'll give you instructions as to how to do what you want.

If you want to change your email address for delivery of your email subscriptions or unsubscribe, you should go to <http://www.fool.co.uk/account/freemailsubscribe.aspx> and follow the prompts.

If you want to close your account - ie, so that it cannot be logged into - please contact us at [CustomerServices@Fool.co.uk](mailto:CustomerServices@Fool.co.uk). 

## Users Aged 16 or Under

If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent/guardian's permission beforehand whenever you provide personal information to The Motley Fool's website. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.

## Changes to this Privacy and Cookie Statement

The Fool may amend this Privacy and Cookie Statement from time to time. If we make any substantive changes to this policy, we'll announce it on our site.
