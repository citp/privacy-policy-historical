### 1\. **Information Collection**

  * _Information You Provide to Us._ We only collect certain information from you when you provide it to us, such as when you: (1) register online or in one of our stores; (2) place an order; (3) complete a survey or product review; (4) participate in one of our promotions; (5) sign up for a Loyalty Program; or (6) contact us. The information we collect from you may include your name, age, postal mailing address, day time telephone number, cell phone number, email address, account user name and password, and payment information. If you use a third party login to register or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party (such as a social network) based on your registration and privacy settings on that third party service.
  * _Registration._ We encourage you to register when shopping on our site or App; however registration is not required. Our Registration Form requires users to provide contact information (such as name, age, postal mailing address, daytime telephone number, cell phone number, email address and password). **You must be 16 years of age or older to register or have consent of a parent or legal guardian.** Registration helps us to provide you with a quick and simple checkout experience. You can also register when you are shopping in our store. The customer contact information you provide will be used to contact you concerning the status of an order, send you a digital receipt from your in-store purchase, answer your questions and, in case you choose to opt-in, to send you communications about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product information. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your registration information and password. You are responsible for all use of the site or App under your registered account. If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile. While it is not required, information obtained from the customer profile questions helps us to learn more about our customers and is used to improve your shopping experience and to provide you with more relevant content and advertising.  
At Foot Locker you have the option of using the so-called Facebook Connect feature to log in using your Facebook account without the need for additional registration. Facebook Connect is a service of the Facebook social media network and is operated by Facebook Inc (1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA) Registration at Foot Locker is therefore no longer necessary. When you log in using Facebook Connect, you are redirected to the Facebook website where you can conveniently log in using your Facebook user information. During this process, your Facebook profile is linked with our Foot Locker service. Only information you have consented to be used is shared with us, such as (first name, last name, email address, profile image, gender, date of birth, place of residence, list of friends, interests and likes). We will only use this information to identify you in the context of your use of Foot Locker and to improve your shopping experience with more appropriate content and offers. You can find more information on Facebook Connect as well as access to your privacy settings at the following web page: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.
  * _Information We Automatically Collect._ We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or other technologies to automatically collect certain information when you use our site or App, or interact with our emails or advertisements on our site, our App, or other sites. For more information on cookies, please read the chapter on “Cookies” below.
  * _Tracking Options._ You may adjust your browser settings to limit certain tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Services or take full advantage of our offerings. Even without a cookie, you can still take advantage of most of the features of our site, including making a purchase, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user unless you log in.
  * _Service Providers._ We may use certain service providers to provide you with more relevant online advertising based on your activities on our site and third party sites. Foot Locker will not (and will not allow any third party to) use these services to track or collect or otherwise process any personal data of Internet users.



For certain service providers, such as social media platforms, and on your mobile device, you can adjust your privacy and advertising settings to limit your tracking for advertising or control whether you receive more relevant advertising.

  * _Information Collected From Other Sources._ We may obtain information about you from other sources, including social networks that you use to connect with us. This information may include name, user name, demographic information, updated address or contact information, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media and online activity.
  * _Combination of Information._ We may also combine the information we receive from and about you, including the information you provide to us on one of the Services, information we receive from third parties, information we automatically collect (as explained above), and information provided or collected offline when you shop in our Stores.



We will not identify users or facilitate the merging of personally identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless we have your explicit notice and your prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that identification or merger. Irrespective of your consent, we will not attempt to disaggregate data that Google reports in aggregate.

We may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about site users with third parties.

### **13\. Use of Cookies**

We use cookies on our site to make visiting our site attractive and allow the use of certain functions. These are small text files that are stored on your computer. Many cookies used on our site are automatically deleted from your hard drive after you finish using the site (so-called session cookies). Other cookies are stored on your computer and make it possible for us to recognize your computer on your next visit (so-called persistent cookies). If you don't want our cookies to be stored on your computer, please disable the storing of cookies in your browser for our site or set your browser so that cookies are generally not stored on your computer.

For example, we may automatically collect information such as your IP address, geolocation data, unique user ID, cell phone model, operating system, and carrier, and Internet Service Provider. We also may collect information about your use of our Services, such as the time you spend using the site or App, the number of times you return, whether you click-through, open, or forward links, emails, and ads, and other Service usage data. These technologies, such as cookies, allow us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site or App, recognize registered users when they visit, and to provide those customers with information and advertising that is more relevant to them. If you register with or order from us, we may use cookies or other technologies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our Services and what you buy. If you do not register with or buy from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use in order to improve your shopping experience and provide you with more relevant content and advertising.

The following cookies are used on our site:

  * **Session ID**  
In order to facilitate browsing through our site, we use a so-called session ID (or session identifier in full), which is allocated to each user at the beginning of each visit to our site. This session ID enables our server to identify you and/or your computer/browser as the same visitor, even if the IP address may have changed in the meantime. Based on this session ID, several associated inquiries made by a user can be allocated to one session. The session ID cookie used by us will only be valid until the end of a session. It will be deleted automatically upon closing your browser.


  * **Google Analytics**  
This site collects and stores data for marketing and optimisation purposes using cookies-based technologies from Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA (Hereafter: “Google”). From this data, user profiles can be created under a pseudonym. Cookies allow recognition of the web browser you use. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there. We use Google Analytics with an IP anonymization feature on our site. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from member states of the European Union or signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. The data collected with Google Analytics technologies will not be used without the explicit consent of the person concerned; it will not be used to personally identify visitors to this site and it will not be merged with personal data regarding the user of the pseudonym. Data collection and storage can be cancelled any time with effect for the future. In this case, a cookie will be stored on your computer which indicates to us for as long as it is stored on your computer that you do not want Google Analytics to be used. Please do not delete this cookie as long as you wish to maintain your objection.


  * **Google Analytics Store Visits**  
We also activated "Store Visits" in Google Analytics on our site. Based on the anonymized aggregated data collected in Google analytics, Google Store Visits provides an estimated count of the number of store visits from users who visited our website and then visit one of our physical stores within 30 days. Store Visits data is based on anonymous, aggregated statistics. Google Analytics creates modeled numbers by using current and past data on the number of people who visit our website and later visit our store. Store Visits data can't be tied to individual ad clicks or people. Google uses industry best practices to ensure the privacy of individual users. You can maintain your settings to opt-in or opt-out in your google account at any time <https://myactivity.google.com/>


  * **Google Maps with recommendation components**

We use the “Google Maps” component on our site in combination with the so-called “Share function". “Google Maps” is a service of Google. Each time this component is called up, Google sets a cookie in order to process the user configuration and data when the page with the integrated “Google Maps” component is displayed. As a general rule, this cookie is not deleted by closing the browser, but rather expires after a certain time, as long as it is not previously manually deleted by you. If you do not agree with this processing of your data, you may choose to deactivate the “Google Maps” service

and thereby prevent the transfer of data to Google. To do this, you must deactivate the Java Script function in your browser. However, we would like to point out that in this case you will not be able to use “Google Maps” or at least only to a limited extent.

The use of “Google Maps” and the information obtained through “Google Maps” is according to Google’s Terms of Use as well as the additional Terms and Conditions for "Google Maps".

The Google Maps function also includes the following recommendation buttons:

“Google+-Button” from the company Google. “Facebook-Button” from the company Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA and the “Twitter-Button” from the company Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. By calling up the “Google Maps” page, these “Recommendation components” cause the browser you are using to download a corresponding display of the component from the respective provider. In this way, the respective provider mentioned above will be informed about which specific page of our internet site you are currently visiting. If you are logged in to your personal account at the provider previously mentioned at the time of calling up the “Google Maps” page, this will be able to collect the information obtained about the sites recommended by you as well as your IP address and other browser relevant information and link it to your respective account.

If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data by the respective provider about you and your behaviour on our site, you must log out of those providers before you visit our site. You can find out more about the data collection of the respective providers in their privacy policies online.



  * **Use of Google-Adwords**


  1. For purposes of promotion, our site also employs the Google ad tool "Google-Adwords". As part of this, our site employs the analysis service "Conversion-Tracking" from Google If you access our site by way of a Google ad, a cookie is placed on your computer. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and stores to your computer. These so-called "conversion cookies" cease to be active after 30 days and are not used to identify you personally. If you visit certain pages of our site while the cookie is still active, we and Google know that you, as user, have clicked on ads placed on Google and were redirected to our site. Google uses the information obtained through "conversion cookies" to compile statistics for our site. These statistics tell us the total number of users who have clicked on our ad as well as which pages of our site were then accessed by each user. However, neither we nor other advertisers who use "Google-Adwords" receive any kind of information that can be used to personally identify users. You can prevent the installation of "conversion cookies" by making the appropriate change to your browser settings, for example by setting your browser so that the automatic placement of cookies is deactivated or by blocking cookies from the domain "googleadservices.com “. You can obtain the relevant data privacy policy from Google



  * **Use of Google AdSense**


  1. Our site employs Google AdSense. Google AdSense is a service of Google for incorporating advertisements. Google-AdSense uses so-called “cookies“, text files, that are stored to your computer and which provide analysis of the use of our site. furthermore, Google AdSense uses so-called “web beacons“. Web beacons allow Google to analyze information, such as visitor traffic to our site. This information, along with your IP address and the ad format displayed, is transmitted to Google in the US where it is stored and may be transferred by Google to contracting partners. However, Google does not merge your IP-address with other stored data on you. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our site. By using our site you declare that you agree to the

processing of data collected about you by Google in the manner previously described and for the purposes there specified.



  * **The use of Google Remarketing**


  1. On our site, we promote the service Google Remarketing belonging to the company Google. Advertisements may appear for users who have already visited our site in the past with Google Remarketing. Within the Google network, advertisements adapted to your interests can hereby be displayed on our site. Google Remarketing uses cookies

for this evaluation. Cookies are small text files stored on your computer which allow the use of the site to be analyzed. This makes it possible to recognize our visitors if these sites are accessed within the advertising network of Google. In this way, advertisements can be presented within the advertising network of Google based on content which has previously been accessed on sites within the Google advertising network by visitors who are also using the Google Remarketing feature. Google does not itself collect any personal data. You can disable this feature by making the appropriate settings under <http://www.google.com/settings/ads> (http://www.google.com/settings/ads).

Use of affilinet tracking cookies. Our site employs affilinet tracking cookies in order to correctly record sales and/or leads. Cookies are small text files that are saved to your computer when you visit a site. These affilinet tracking cookies do not store

personal data of any kind. Instead, it only collects the identification number of the intermediary partner as well as the reference number of the advertising material that was clicked on by the visitor to the site. This information is required in order to process the payment transaction between the site operator and the advertiser. The partner identification number serves to designate the intermediary partner to which a commission is to be paid once a transaction has been concluded. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our site.



  * **Online advertising / third-party cookies**


  1. Some of the cookies on our site are used by our co-operation partners for the purposes of online marketing (so-called third-party cookies). Here is some more information:

When you visit our site for the first time, specific cookies from our advertising partners are stored on your computer and used by our co-operation partners for switching, optimisation and evaluation of online advertising. These cookies collect information such as the products you view on our site. Advertisements of our deals can subsequently be switched on sites of partners of the advertising networks of our cooperation partners (so-called usage-based advertising). When ads appear on other sites, information about your visit to this site where we have an advertisement – such as how many times you have viewed an ad – will be collected and passed on to us. However, no personal data are generated or forwarded. You can therefore not be identified personally on the basis of this information.




We may use cookies and other similar technologies to make our site better. You can read more about this and how to limit or decline cookies under Section I “ **Information Collection** " and specifically paragraph 4 “ **Tracking Options"**.

### **14\. Plug-ins**

On our site, we use so-called plug-ins of various social networks. Here is more information on the plug-ins we use:

  * **Facebook Social Plug-ins**



Our site uses programmes (plug-ins) from the social network Facebook. These are operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (Facebook). The Facebook plugins are identifiable by the Facebook logo or the "Like" or "Share" buttons on our site. When you visit a page on our site, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook server using the plugin.
