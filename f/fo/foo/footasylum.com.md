## Profiling and Automated Decision Making.

### Profiling

We use a third party data processor to help us analyse sets of data to determine common patterns in behaviour which allows us to provide you with a more personalised, individual experience on our website, in our digital advertising and in our electronic marketing communications. For example, if we recognise that you browse several products with a common feature over a period of time, we are able to recommend similar products that you may also be interested in.  
You have a right to object to this kind of processing.

### Automated Decision Making

We do not use automated decision-making processes that could be considered to have a significant impact or legal effect on our customers. Examples of this are performed by other companies who use profiling and the results of the profiling to make automated decisions regarding credit worthiness or to deny or permit a service.  
Our profiling data process is used to ensure we can more accurately target direct marketing to you and direct marketing is always sent to you only with your consent which can be withdrawn at any time (for guidance in how to do this, see Stop Marketing Updates).

## Ensure that we do not keep your data any longer than we need to.

We only keep your personal information for as long as we need it, either for the lifetime of your account or for the purposes of providing customer service to you. We may also retain some personal information after the lifetime of your account for legal and regulatory purposes, for the purposes of recording disputes, fraud prevention or for terms and conditions we have agreed with you. In these cases, we will seek to minimise the amount of personal information we hold to ensure that we only retain the personal information we require to meet these obligations.
