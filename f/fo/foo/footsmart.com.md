This information is personally identifiable information such as name, address, email and phone number. The personal information you have provided us and information about your order may be shared with third parties. This information may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from our records and other sources. This information will be used to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. It may also be used by our marketing partners to bring you offers of interest.

If you prefer we do not share the personal information you have provided us and information about your order with marketing partners, please email us at [privacy@footsmart.com](mailto:privacy@footsmart.com) .

In addition to personal information, we collect site usage information to help in our efforts to continually improve our site.

We also use it to perform statistical analysis to improve our website. We may provide statistical information about buying patterns and traffic patterns to others, but this data does not include any personally identifiable information.  
     **d. Use of Cookies

We use cookies to improve your shopping experience. When you visit FootSmart, your cookie helps us keep track of your order as you shop our Web site. If you have saved your information with us, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our Web site and provides you with access to your account information.

We also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our Web site. If you have not saved your information or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Web site in a manner that does not identify you. In either case, this information helps us serve you better by improving our Web site design, as well as our products, services and promotions.

We may also use cookies to track and maintain the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to ours to further improve our Web site design and fulfill contracts with our business partners. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other Web sites.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. **If you turn off cookies, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our Web site.** We will also not be able to recognize you as a registered user and allow you to access your account information.  
  
  
**2.   Receiving Information From FootSmart  
**  
**      a. Email**  
| 

FootSmart periodically sends email to our customers to help keep you informed of FootSmart's new products, features and/or special promotions. In every email that we distribute, we include instructions on how to remove [unsubscribe] your email address from the distribution list or you may simply email us with our [Customer Service Contact Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20080623113042id_/http%3A//www.footsmart.com/ContactUs.aspx) and request to be removed from the mailing list.  
  
  
     **b. Catalog

| 

In addition to shopping on our website, FootSmart distributes a full-product catalog. We send these catalogs throughout the year to our registered users and customers.

**3.   Changing Personal Information  
**  
| If you need to make any changes to your personally stored information it is possible to update your name, billing address, shipping address, phone number and email address by clicking on "Access Your Account" or during checkout, when you modify your account information.  
**4.   Online policy for individuals 17 years old and under  
**  
| This site is not directed to children under the age of 13 and no information should be submitted through the website by individuals 17 years of age and under without their parent's or guardian's permission.  
**5.   Secure Credit Card Transaction Processing  
**  
| Our web site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to transmit your credit card information from a secure web page to a secure application on our server. Once on our server, your credit card number is saved only long enough for us to process and approve the transaction unless you have chosen to establish a FootSmart account. During the final stages of ordering online, you will see an unbroken key or locked padlock at the bottom of your browser window and https:// in the location window at the top of your browser. Both of these indicate that the page you are on is secured using SSL encryption to communicate with our secure web server. Because SSL encryption slows down a web site, it is only used in the final stage of ordering, before and after you enter your credit card information. You will not see these security indicators until you begin the checkout process and indicate that you prefer to order online with a credit card.  
**6.   Acceptance of Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions  
**  
| By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by FootSmart. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of our policies.
