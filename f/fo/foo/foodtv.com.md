**Privacy Policy**  
FoodTV.com is committed to protecting the online privacy of visitors to its Web site. We believe that greater protection of personal privacy on the Web will not only protect consumers, but also increase consumer confidence and ultimately their participation in online activities. At FoodTV.com, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. 

The purpose of our policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you visit our site(s), how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. 

Our site(s) may contain links to other Web sites, including Web sites directed to children. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our business partners, advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide links from our sites. You should check the applicable privacy policy of the Web site sponsor when linking to other Web sites. 

**I. Personal Information Which We Collect**   
We may request that you supply us with personal information, including your e-mail address, postal address, home or work telephone number, credit card number (only if you choose to purchase a product online), for such purposes as correspondence, making a purchase, or participating in online contests, surveys or games. If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we or our business partners may need--to correspond with you, to process an order or to provide you with a subscription, for example--then it is our intent to let you know how we will use such information. Like many other commercial sites, our site(s) may utilize a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a Web site recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was previously browsing the site. Our cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on a computer virus. Our Web site(s) may use cookies to enhance your visit. Cookies can securely store a user's password, personalize Homes, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." Our cookies may collect a domain name (for example, "aol.com" or "netcom.com") and track a path through our Web pages. We only use "cookies" to gather the information indicated in this policy and do not use cookies to gather personal identifying information about you (such as your name) without your consent. 

We may require you to supply us with personal information (demographic information such as age, income, education, population data, zip codes) during a "registration" process online prior to using certain features of our site (for example, prior to entering an online sweepstakes). We use this general information in statistical form to understand our site's demographics, such as percentage of male and female users, geographic location, age ranges, or a combination of these or other demographics. We also require registration in some circumstances to contact users when necessary, such as with online sweepstakes and Forums. As detailed below, we will not share specific information about you to advertisers or third parties without your consent. The Company is not responsible for events arising from the distribution of the registration information if you choose to publicly post or share that information. 

**II. Use of User Information**   
We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate (group) user behavior. This allows us to measure relative consumer interest in the various areas of our Web sites for product development purposes. Any information we collect is used for our own internal purposes to improve the content of the Web site(s), to enhance users' experiences when visiting our site(s), to customize the content and/or layout of our pages, and to provide the services required by an individual user. We do not use personal identifying information for any reason that is not disclosed either in this Policy or at the time the information is requested. Aside from an automatic reply to an e-mail received by us, it is our intent not to e-mail to you unless you request a particular service, or consent to being contacted by e-mail. There may be instances where you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail list that will send information about the site or our advertisers to your e-mail address, but after an initial mailing gauging your interest this will be continued only with your permission and consent.

Third-Party advertising companies such as DoubleClick Inc. utilize certain technologies to deliver specific advertisements, which appear on pages throughout this Web site, to the site's users. These companies may collect, store and use non-personally identifiable user information. If you want to prevent a third-party advertiser from collecting such user information, you may either visit each third party advertiser's Web site directly and opt-out (for example [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object=1&) for DoubleClick's privacy policy and opt-out options), or [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp) to visit the NAI gateway opt-out site. The NAI gateway opt-out site will allow you to review various third-party advertising companies' privacy policies and opt-out options. 

**III. Disclosure to Third Parties**   
We do not share personal identifying information with any third party without your permission. We disclose only in aggregate (group) form our statistical analyses or demographics of users to third parties, such as advertisers or other business partners. This aggregate information does not include names or e-mail addresses. In some instances, we operate shared Web sites with businesses affiliated with us. Our Privacy Policy will apply to these Web sites. PLEASE BE AWARE that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (such as your name or e-mail address) in chat areas or bulletin boards or to third parties, that information may be collected by others outside our control and may result in unsolicited messages from others. 

**IV. Accuracy of User Information**   
Questions regarding our Privacy Policy, the accuracy of your personal information or the use of the information collected should be directed via e-mail to [webmaster@foodtv.com](mailto:webmaster@foodtv.com), or you can reach us by telephone at (212) 398-8836. You also can write us at:

Food Network  
Attn: Web Site Privacy Policy  
1180 Avenue of the Americas, 11th Floor  
New York, NY 10036 

These privacy policies are effective as of October 25, 2001. We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time, and will post any changes to this Policy as soon as they go into effect. 

**V. Security of Information**   
We seek to ensure the security of personal information submitted by our users. When collecting credit card information for online purchases, we offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it. When we collect other information from our users, it is stored in an area to which the general public does not have access. 

**VI. Opting-out**   
At times while assessing our site(s), a user may be given a choice of "opting-out" of certain uses of his or her information. We will provide this choice where appropriate. 

**VII. Permission to Use of Materials**   
The right to download and store or output the materials in our site(s) is granted for the user's personal use only, and materials may not be reproduced in any edited form. Any other reproduction, transmission, performance, display or editing of these materials by any means mechanical or electronic without the express written permission of the Company is strictly prohibited. Users wishing to obtain permission to reprint or reproduce any materials appearing on this site may contact us at [webmaster@foodtv.com](mailto:webmaster@foodtv.com).
