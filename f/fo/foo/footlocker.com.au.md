# Privacy Policy

Foot Locker, its subsidiaries and its affiliates believe in protecting your information. With this in mind, we have adopted this Privacy Policy, which describes the information we may collect when you use our Website, sign up for a brand loyalty membership (each a "Loyalty Program"), use our mobile applications (each an "App") or shop in our stores (each a "Store") (collectively the "Services"). By using the Services, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, then please do not use our Services. 

**PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
Personal information is information or an opinion that identifies you or that will enable your identity to be reasonably ascertained (including your name and contact details such as your residential or postal address, email address, date of birth or your telephone number).

Please note that any information which cannot be reasonably linked to your identity (e.g. IP address, browser information, favourite websites) does not constitute personal information and is not regulated by the Privacy Act.

Foot Looker collects information about you and its other customers using the Services and the information collected may vary depending on your particular interaction with Foot Locker, but will be limited to the information necessary to record and manage Foot Locker’s interaction with you or as permitted or required by law.

The personal information that Foot Locker collects is primarily related to its provision of the Services and by providing such personal information, you consent to your personal information being collected, stored, used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**INFORMATION COLLECTION**  


  1. _Information You Provide to Us._ We only collect personal information from you when you provide it to us, such as when you: (1) register on our Website; (2) place an order; (3) complete a survey or product review; (4) participate in one of our promotions; (5) sign up for a Loyalty Program; or (6) contact us. The personal information we collect from you may include your name, age, mailing address, daytime telephone number, mobile phone number, e-mail address, account user name and password, and payment information. If you use a third party login to register or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party (such as a social network) based on your registration and privacy settings on that third party service. 

The provision of your personal information is entirely voluntary and you are entirely free to decide whether or not to give your personal information to us. However, you acknowledge and agree that if you do not provide sufficient or adequate information to us, we may not be able to provide you with a full range of Services or may not be able to fully assist you with your enquiry. 

  

  2. _Registration._ Registration on our Website or App helps us to provide you with a quick and simple checkout experience. We encourage you to register when shopping on our Website or App; however please note that registration is not required in order to shop with us. Our Registration Form requires users to provide contact information (such as name, age, mailing address, daytime telephone number, mobile phone number, e-mail address and password). You must be 18 years of age or older to register or have consent of a parent or legal guardian. The personal information you provide will be used to contact you concerning the status of an order, answer your questions and, if you choose to opt-in, to send you communications about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product information. Please note that you will be able to opt-out of receiving such communications at any time. 

You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your registration information and password. You are responsible for all use of the Website or App under your registered account. If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile. While it is not required, personal information obtained from the customer profile questions helps us to learn more about our customers and is used to improve your shopping experience and to provide you with more relevant content and advertising.

  

  3. _Information We Automatically Collect._ We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, or other technologies to automatically collect certain information when you use our Website or App, or interact with our emails or advertisements on our Website, our App, or other websites. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Please note that our cookies do not store or collect any personal information about you nor do they personally identify you (though they do identify a user's browser). We may automatically collect information such as your IP address, geolocation data, unique user ID, mobile phone model, operating system, and carrier, and Internet Service Provider. We also may collect information about your use of our Services, such as the time you spend using the Website or App, the number of times you return, whether you click-through, open, or forward links, emails, and advertisements and other Service usage data. 

These technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, allow us to keep track of your order as you shop on our Website or App, recognise registered users when they visit, and provide customers with information and advertising that is more relevant to them. If you register with or order from us, we may use cookies or other technologies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our Services and what you buy. If you do not register with or buy from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use in order to improve your shopping experience and provide you with more relevant content and advertising. 

  

  4. _Tracking Options._ Most browsers are set to accept cookies automatically. However, you may adjust your browser settings to limit certain tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Services or take full advantage of our offerings. Even without a cookie, you can still take advantage of most of the features of our Website, including making a purchase, but we will not be able to recognise you as a registered user unless you log in.
  

  5. _Third Party Service Providers._ We may use third party service providers to provide you with more relevant online advertising based on your activities on our Website and third party sites. On our website we use the services of Google Analytics and Adobe Target for analysing aggregated non-personalised data. Foot Locker will not (and will not allow any third party to) use these services to track or collect or otherwise process any personal information of users of its Website. For certain service providers, such as social media platforms, and on your mobile device, you can adjust your privacy and advertising settings to limit your tracking for advertising or control whether you receive more relevant advertising. 

We will not identify users or facilitate the merging of personal information with non-personal information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless we have your explicit notice and your prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to that identification or merger. Irrespective of your consent, we will not attempt to disaggregate data that Google reports in aggregate.

  

  6. _Combination of Information._ We may also combine the information we receive from and about you, including the information you provide to us on one of the Services, information we automatically collect (as explained above), and information provided or collected offline when you shop in our Stores.
