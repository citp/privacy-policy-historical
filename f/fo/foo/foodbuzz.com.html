<br>
<p>Updated June 18, 2007</p>
<br>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers the website www.foodbuzz.com (the "Site"), which is owned by Pricing Dynamics, Inc., dba Foodbuzz ("Foodbuzz", "we" or "us"). Foodbuzz will maintain your data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<br> 
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To demonstrate our commitment to our users' privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices.</p>
<br> 
<p>This Privacy Policy is an integral part of our Site and cannot, in any way, be separated from the Users Agreement or from the usage or transaction process. If you do not agree to our Privacy Policy in whole, you must not use the Site. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you can contact Foodbuzz customer service by email at support@foodbuzz.com.</p>
<br> 
<p>In summary:</p>
<br>
<span class="indent">We will not collect personal information without your knowledge and permission;</span><br> 
<span class="indent">We will not knowingly disclose your personal information to third parties, except as provided in this Privacy Policy;</span><br> 
<span class="indent">We will allow you to view, correct or remove your personal information; and</span><br> 
<span class="indent">We will take reasonable steps to protect the security of the personal information we collect from you. </span><br>
<br>
<p>Consent</p>
<br>
<p>BY SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US, AND/OR BY USING OUR SITE, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AS PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY LAW. </p>
<br>
<p>If you do not agree with these terms, do not provide any personal information to us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, or if you choose not to provide us with any required personal information, we may not be able to provide you with services that can be offered on our Site.</p> 
<br>
<p>Eligibility</p>
<br>
<p>You must be 18 or over, or the legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction if that age is over 18 years of age, to register as a Foodbuzz member or to use the Site and Services.

Only your website persona is automatically displayed on the Site.  You may choose to display your name or to not display your name.  Your email and password are never displayed on the Site.  This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including: (1) to allow you to log in to your profile using a secret password so that you may fully utilize the services provided on the website, (2) to allow us, if necessary, to contact you for customer service, (3) to allow us to send you a confirmation email upon joining that makes it more difficult for third-party "spammers" to abuse our registration process.  As a registered member, you can opt-in to receive email updates from us about special offers, new foodbuzz.com services, and other noteworthy information including comments that other users have made to content that you have submitted. However, you may always choose to decline to receive these email messages at any time. Please see our Opt-out policy described below.</p>

<br>
<p>Usage of Your Information to Enhance the Users Experience </p>
<br>
<p>Cookies</p>
<br>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer with information about your visit to a particular site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session ID cookies are erased when you close your browser and do not last beyond one visit to our Site. Session cookies help us keep track of information such as what date or restaurant you are searching for. A persistent cookie is a small file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. These cookies are used to remember items like your login information if you have selected for it to be remembered on your computer. </p>
<br>
<p> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. If you reject the cookie, you may not be able to fully use the Site. In particular, session ID cookies are required to store relevant information as a user moves from page to page. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. </p>
<br>
<p>Log Files</p>
<br>
<p>Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track general user movement (as a whole rather than as individuals), diagnose problems with our servers and gather broad demographic information. IP addresses and log files are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p> 
<br>
<p>Pixel tags </p>
<br>
<p>We use pixel tags to monitor the open rate of our communications. This helps us understand the effectiveness of communications we send. We do not use this information for any other purpose.</p>
<br> 
<p>Security</p>
<br>
<p>Foodbuzz takes every precaution to protect your personal information. When you submit sensitive information via the Site, this information is protected both online and offline.</p>
<br> 
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your personal information offline. All of our user's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our user's information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.</p>
<br> 
<p>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</p>
<br> 
<p>If a Registered User's personally identifiable information (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address) changes or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate user's personally identifiable information. Registered Users can change your personal information on the User Profile (My Profile) page of our Site. Users can also email our customer support at support@foodbuzz.com.</p>
<br>
<p>Notification of Changes</p>
<br>
<p>If we decide to change our policies, we will add those changes to this Privacy Policy and other places on the Site we deem appropriate so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.</p> 
<br>
<p>If, however, we are going to use your personally information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if you have opted out of all communication with the Site, or deleted/deactivated your account, then you will not be contacted, nor will your personal information be used in this new manner.</p> 
<br>
<p>California Privacy Rights</p>
<br>
<p>Under California Law, California residents have the right to request in writing from businesses with whom they have an established business relationship, (1) a list of the categories of personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to the customer, that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and (2) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please e-mail us at: support@foodbuzz.com, or write to us at: Customer Service, Foodbuzz, 921 Front St. San Francisco, CA 94111 with a reference to California Disclosure Information.</p>
<br>
<p>We will respond to such written requests within 30 days following receipt at the e-mail or mailing address stated above. If we receive your request at a different e-mail or mailing address, we will respond within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 150 days from the date received. Please note that we are only required to respond to each customer once per calendar year.</p>
