Information Collection

 _Knowledge and Consent._ Your consent will be obtained, as required, for the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. Your consent may be obtained verbally at the store level, in writing on our store forms, through written registration or ballot forms, electronically through our Site, during telephone conversations or during a live chat session.

_Information You Provide to Us._ We only collect certain information from you when you provide it to us, such as when you: (1) register; (2) place an order; (3) shop in our Stores; (4) complete a survey or product review; (5) participate in one of our promotions; (6) sign up for a Loyalty Program; or (7) contact us. The information we collect from you may include your name, age, date of birth, mailing address, daytime telephone number, cell phone number, e-mail address, account user name and password, and payment information. If you use a third party login to register or otherwise link to us, we may receive certain information about you from the third party (such as a social network) based on your registration and privacy settings on that third party service.

_Registration._ We encourage you to register when shopping on our Site; however registration is not required. Our registration form requires users to provide contact information (such as name, age, mailing address, daytime telephone number, cell phone number, e-mail address and password). **You must be 14 years of age or older to register.** Registration helps us to provide you with a quick and simple checkout experience. The customer contact information you provide will be used to contact you concerning the status of an order, answer your questions and, if you have chosen to opt-in, to send you communications about upcoming sales, contests, promotions and product information, including via email, instant message, SMS text message and direct mail. _You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your registration information and password._ You are responsible for all use of the Site under your registered account. If you would like, you can also fill out a customer profile.

We also may collect information about your use of our Services, such as the time you spend using the Site, the number of times you return, whether you click-through, open, or forward links, emails, and ads, and other Site usage data. These technologies, such as cookies, allow us to keep track of your order as you shop on our Site, recognize registered users when they visit, and to provide those customers with information and advertising that is more relevant to them.

If you register with or order from us, we may use cookies to monitor and maintain information about how you use our Site and what you buy in order to improve your shopping experience and provide you with more relevant content and advertising. Even if you do not register with or buy from us, we may still monitor and maintain certain information about your use of our Site for these same purposes.

Even without a cookie, you can still take advantage of most of the features of our Site, including making a purchase, but we will not be able to recognize you as a registered user unless you log in.
