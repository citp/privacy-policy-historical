INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED

We also may use non-identifiable information to initiate interactive, real-time discussions with users. Your non-identifiable information may be disclosed to others and permanently archived for future use.

3\. Cookies: The website uses cookies, a technology that installs a small amount of information on a website user's computer to permit the website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the website. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the website, so you do not have to enter your personal information every time, offer personalized web page content and information for your use, track your activity at the website to respond to your needs and otherwise facilitate your website experience.

Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. 

We employ, either directly or through trusted third parties, a software technology called tracking pixels, which help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Tracking pixels are tiny, transparent graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to provide analytical information concerning the user experience as well as supporting custom marketing activities for our web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by tracking pixels to our customers' personally identifiable information.
