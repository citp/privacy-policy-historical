We also collect non-personal information ("Anonymous Information"), such as pages visited, on the Foodie Blogroll.com. We may also collect or develop aggregated information, which may include Anonymous Information and Personal Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you or any of our other users ("Aggregated Information"). </p>
