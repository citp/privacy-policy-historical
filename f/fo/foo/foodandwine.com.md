When you **browse** any American Express Publishing website, you do so anonymously. Personal information -- including your E-mail address -- is _not_ collected. We may, however, request that you **voluntarily** supply us with personal information, including your E-mail address, for purposes such as correspondence, site registration, making a purchase, or participating in online surveys.

Like many other commercial websites, American Express Publishing websites may utilize a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. Please read [About Cookies](https://web.archive.org/web/20030412200657id_/http://www.amexpub.com/privacy/cookies.html) for more information.

**Information Use**

If you provide us with your E-mail address, or have done so in the past, we may upon occasion send you E-mail offers. We may use information you have given us to, for example, provide a service, measure consumer interest in our various services, or inform you about products and services. These offers may be based on information you provided in your initial transaction with us, from surveys that may indicate purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources, such as census bureau data. We may also, upon occasion, share E-mail addresses with certain other well-established companies so that they can send you product and service offers that may be of interest. 

All offers are carefully developed to ensure that they meet our standards. Our goal is to target offers to people who we believe will find them of value. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under strict conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of customer personal information.

**Declining E-mail Offers**

American Express Publishing provides customers with an easy means to decline receiving E-mail offers. 

Although most customers tell us they appreciate receiving notice of these carefully designed opportunities, we recognize the importance of providing you with choices. At any time, you may request to discontinue receiving these offers by simply replying to the E-mail and informing us of your preferences. All E-mail offers that you receive from American Express Publishing will inform you of how to decline receiving further E-mail offers.

American Express Publishing does not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children.
