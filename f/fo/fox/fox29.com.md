**Privacy Policy  
FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC.**  


Effective Date: July 1, 2001

FOX Philadelphia, a unit of Fox Television Stations, Inc. ("Fox"), is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of [Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. FOX Philadelphia has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. 

From time to time FOX Philadelphia may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law, technology or industry initiatives. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.

_**COLLECTION:** COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY FOX Philadelphia_

**General.** FOX Philadelphia collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services, or information. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.

**Cookies**. Cookies are small bits of information that the Internet sites operated by FOX Philadelphia place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on our site(s) and enable FOX Philadelphia to make your visits to our site(s) more enjoyable. The cookie itself does not contain PII and FOX Philadelphia does not combine cookies with PII. FOX Philadelphia’s site currently generates cookies that remain only for the duration of the session for which you are logged in, and are then deleted. A new session cookie is generated each time you visit FOX Philadelphia’s site.

Third party advertisements displayed on Internet site(s) operated by FOX Philadelphia may also contain cookies. FOX Philadelphia does not control these advertiser cookies and visitors to our web site(s) should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. 

**_NOTICE:_** FOX Philadelphia WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When FOX Philadelphia collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses FOX Philadelphia will make of the information. 

This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your personal information (See "Use" below). However, at the time your PII is collected, FOX Philadelphia will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below). 

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.

FOX Philadelphia’s web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a FOX Philadelphia logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by FOX Philadelphia. FOX Philadelphia’s web site(s) also carry advertisements from other companies as well as advertisements placed by national Internet ad agencies. Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, FOX Philadelphia is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites or for the privacy practices of third party or so-called national advertisers. Once you’ve left FOX Philadelphia’s site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

FOX Philadelphia’s web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with FOX Philadelphia. Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.

_**CHOICE** : FOX Philadelphia WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII_

FOX Philadelphia will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted. You will also be able to choose whether your information is shared with companies that are not affiliated with FOX Philadelphia (i.e., not part of the News America Group).

_**USE:** FOX Philadelphia’S USE OF PII_

FOX Philadelphia will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and only for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other uses are disclosed at the time of collection and you allow us to use your information in these other ways. 

FOX Philadelphia may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is part of the News America Group of companies. FOX Philadelphia may also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with FOX Philadelphia, but would like to send you information about their products and services. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties.

FOX Philadelphia employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) may only use PII to provide FOX Philadelphia with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

If FOX Philadelphia obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy.

FOX Philadelphia may be required to disclose PII to comply with legal requirements, such as a court order, and to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites.

_**SECURITY** : FOX Philadelphia PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII_

FOX Philadelphia uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. In addition, FOX Philadelphia uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
