  <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Fox5sandiego.com strives
  to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to
  provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally
  Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address,
  telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. Please note
  this policy applies only to information collected by Fox5Sandiego.com online
  and does not impact information collected or used by Fox5Sandiego.com or its
  affiliates through other means. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">How we gather
  information from users.</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">How we collect and
  store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in
  which you elect to participate and the services provided. You can visit many
  pages on our site without providing any information. Other pages may prompt
  you to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions
  of our site, sign up for membership, request certain features (e.g.,
  newsletters, news updates and other products), sign up for a newspaper
  subscription or make a purchase. You may also provide information when you
  participate in sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities,
  message boards and chat rooms and other interactive areas of our site.<br>
  <br>
  Like most Web sites, Fox5Sandiego.com also collects information automatically
  and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our
  visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider
  or use "cookie" technology. Among other things, the cookie may
  store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that
  information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you
  encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt
  additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In
  certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example
  by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit
  your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to
  re-enter your user name and password. Additionally we may not be able to
  customize the site's features according to your preferences.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">What we do with the
  information we collect.</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We will use your
  information only as permitted by law. Aggregated Information (information
  that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. As one
  example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar
  information obtained from other users to learn which pages are visited most
  or what features are most attractive. Aggregated Information may occasionally
  be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but cannot be used to
  contact you individually.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">We also collect
  information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and
  advertising. For example, we may use Personally Identifiable Information
  collected on Fox5Sandiego.com to communicate with you regarding our <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="javascript:void(window.open('/pages/terms_of_service'));">Terms of Service</a> and privacy policy, products and services offered by
  Fox5Sandiego.com and other Tribune Company affiliates and partners,
  administration of sweepstakes and contests, processing e-commerce
  transactions and other topics we think you might find of interest. We reserve
  the right to share this information with other Tribune Company business units
  and affiliates, including for example our affiliated newspapers and entities
  in which Tribune Company has an ownership interest (collectively, "Affiliates").
  This policy does not apply to any Affiliate's use of such information.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Personally Identifiable
  Information collected by Fox5Sandiego.com may also be used for other purposes
  including but not limited to site administration and troubleshooting. Certain
  third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site
  (our Web hosting service and our newsletter provider, for example) may access
  such information.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">As we continue to develop
  our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or
  businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the
  transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a
  court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do
  so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,
  and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information
  to law enforcement authorities. Please note we may not provide you with
  notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Your choice to opt
  out.</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The quality news and
  information on Fox5Sandiego.com is supported by advertising revenue and a
  controlled program of e-mail marketing is an important element of our online
  publishing business. Like other Web publishers, we sometimes permit our advertising
  and promotional partners to e-mail you about services, features, products,
  special offers and unique content we believe might interest you. If you
  prefer not to receive e-mail communications sent directly from our
  advertisers or promotional partners, you will be given an opportunity to
  decline before you provide us information we might use for this purpose. If
  you decline at the time you provide us such information, we will not share
  the Personally Identifiable Information you provide with non-Affiliated
  advertisers for such purposes, though we may on occasion send you information
  on their behalf. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Affiliated sites,
  linked sites and advertisements.</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Fox5Sandiego.com
  expects its partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the
  privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners,
  advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our
  site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
  For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part
  of a frame on a Fox5Sandiego.com page, certain content that is actually
  created or hosted by a third party. Also, through Fox5Sandiego.com you may be
  introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, advertisements,
  features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Fox5Sandiego.com
  is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You
  should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when
  providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">A cookie gets entered by
  your Web browser into the "Cookies" folder on your hard drive after
  you close your browser, and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits
  to the Site. We use persistent and session cookies to analyze and enhance
  your experience on the Site, and use third party ad technology to serve ads.
  The data that is collected is the property of sandiegocw.com, not the third
  party. We also allow third parties called ad networks or ad servers to serve
  ads to you on sandiegocw.com. Cookies enable them to compile information
  about where you, or others who have used your computer, saw their
  advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information makes
  it possible for the ad technology, ad servers and ad networks to deliver
  targeted advertisements to you on sandiegocw.com. Fox5Sandiego.com does not
  have access to the cookies that may be placed on your computer by third-party
  ad technology, ad servers or ad networks. Fox5Sandiego.com maintains
  relationships with a number of third-party networks, including Doubleclick,
  Unicast, and Pointroll. Those parties that use cookies may offer you a way to
  opt out of ad targeting. You may find more information at the Web site of the
  individual ad network or the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp"><b>Network
  Advertising Initiative.</b></a></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">While on our site, our
  advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or
  other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve
  information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by
  third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine
  whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features
  available on our site, third parties may use cookies or other technology to
  gather information. Fox5Sandiego.com does not control the use of this
  technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any
  actions or policies of such third parties.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Please be careful and
  responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily
  disclose Personally Identifiable Information on our site, such as in message
  boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that information
  can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without
  our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals
  or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Fox5Sandiego.com
  and this policy.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
