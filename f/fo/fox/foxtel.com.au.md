  * the fact that you have applied for credit and the amount,
  * the fact that we are a current credit provider to you;
  * payments that are more than 60 days overdue and for which debt collection action has started;
  * information that in our opinion you have committed a serious credit infringement (that is, acted fraudulently or shown an intention not to comply with your credit obligations); and
  * cheques drawn by you for $100 or more which have been dishonoured more than once.



If we report your default to a credit reporting agency your credit rating may be affected and you may have difficulty obtaining credit in the future.

The section on Payments in FOXTEL’s Residential Digital Subscription Agreement tells you more about when we will be a credit provider to you.

You can contact us by writing to us at PO Box 612, Moonee Ponds, Victoria, 3039 or contacting us on 131999.
