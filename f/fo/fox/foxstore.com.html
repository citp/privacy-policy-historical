                              Fox Store ("Fox Store"), is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Principles</a> applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. Fox Store has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S both online and offline. 
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
From time to time Fox Store may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our web sites, or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effecitve date will be noted at the begining of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If Fox Store materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of and have not objected to the change.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
<u><b>COLLECTION:</b> COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY FOX STORE</u>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
<u>General</u>. Fox Store collects personally identifiable information ("PII", that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats, bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
<u>Cookies</u>. Cookies are small bits of information that the Internet sites operated by Fox Store place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on our site and enable Fox Store to make your visits to our site more enjoyable. For example, cookies can track the things you have placed your "shopping cart" during a visit to our online store. 
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Third party advertisements displayed on Fox Store's site(s) may also contain cookies set by Internet Advertising companies or advertisers. Fox Store does not control these cookies and visitors to our web site(s) sent by Internet Advertisers or other companies should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Fox Store may use cookies or similar tools to relate your use of our web site(s) to PII obtained by you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream information about your activities on Fox Store's website(s) may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. 
However, if Fox Store wishes to combine your personal and cookie or clickstream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent (i.e., <b>"opt in"</b>). 
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you won't be able to conduct transactions such as placing an order via our shopping cart or completing a sale for any VHS or DVD merchandise.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
<u><b>NOTICE:</b> FOX STORE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</u>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
When you voluntarily provide PII to Fox Store, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Fox Store will make of our information. At the time you provide PII, Fox Store will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See "Choice" below).
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore want to share your personal information provided you have given Fox Store permission to do so (See "Use" below). 
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Fox Store's web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Fox Store logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Fox Store. Fox Store's web site(s) may also carry advertisements from other companies. Fox Store is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third paties that are linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet Advertising companies. Once you've left a Fox Store site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Fox Store's web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Fox Store (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although News America Group entities adhere to the Group's Privacy Principles, visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy. 
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
<u><b>CHOICE:</b> FOX STORE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII</u>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Fox Store will not use the PII you proide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Fox Store (i.e, not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
<u><b>USE:</b> FOX STORE'S USE OF PII</u>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Fox Store will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If Fox Store obtains PII from a third party such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this policy.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Fox Store may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is are part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us consent, fox Store may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with Fox Store, but would like to send you information about their products and services. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties when PII is collected.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Fox Store employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Fox Store may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e, sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) but they may only use PII to provide Fox Store with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
There may be instances when Fox Store may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Fox Store, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud and for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Fox Store sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Fox Store may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
<u><b>SECURITY:</b> FOX STORE PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII</u>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
Fox Store uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Fox Store uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
<u><b>ACCESS:</b> HOW TO ACCESS, OR CORRECT YOUR PII, OR STOP ALL FUTURE COMMUNICATIONS FROM FOX STORE</u>
</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" font="" color="white">
