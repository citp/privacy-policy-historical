<p>We have implemented suitable security policies, rules and technical measures to protect and safeguard all the PII under our control from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction or accidental loss. All our employees and data processors who have access to, and are associated with the processing of your PII, are obliged to respect your privacy.</p><h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>We may send you a permanent cookie when you register with us. A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can help us to recognize you when you next visit the Website, note the advertisements you click on and the other sites you enter via a link from the Website. This allows us to tailor the service we provide to your preferences. We may also use the data generated from cookies to compile statistical data on your use of the Website. The Website uses four types of cookies: (i) 'session cookies' which are stored only temporarily during a browsing session in order to allow normal use of the system and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed; (ii) 'first party cookies' / 'persistent cookies' which are set and read only by the Website, saved on your computer for a fixed period (usually a year or longer) and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Such cookies are used where we need to know who you are for repeat visits, for example to allow us to store your preferences for the next login (such as user name and/or password); (iii) 'third party cookies' which are set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing, for example by third party analytics companies who monitor and analyze our web access; and (iv) 'flash cookies' which are saved during game play to allow quicker and better gaming experience. You are not obliged to accept a cookie from us or from any other website. You can modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for instructions on how to do so correctly. However, for legitimate security reasons, we may refuse access to specific Website content unless you accept the use of a cookie or similar device.</p><h2>Advertisements</h2>
<p>We use a third−party advertising technology to serve advertisements when you visit the Website. This technology uses information about your visits to the Website (not including your name, address, or other personal information), to serve our advertisements to you. In the course of delivering our advertisements to you, a unique third−party 'cookie' may be placed or recognized on your browser. We also transmit Website usage information about visitors to the Website to the servers of a reputable third party for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on the Website and other sites. To do this, we use 'Web beacons' and 'cookies' provided by our third−party advertisement server on the Website. The information that is collected and logged on our behalf through this technology is not personally identifiable. If you do not want your non−personal information used to target advertisements to you, please visit www.networkadvertising.org and follow the "opt−out" instructions.</p><h2>Protection of Minors</h2>
<p>The services provided by the Company are not intended for or directed to minors or persons under the age of legal consent. Any person who provides us with PII represents to us that they are 18 years of age or over the age of legal consent in their jurisdiction. We reserve the right to access and verify any PII submitted by or collected from you. If we become aware that a minor has attempted to or has submitted PII, we may not accept this information and may take steps to remove such information from our records.</p><h2>International Transfer</h2>
<p>Since we operate globally, it may be necessary to transfer your PII to Recipients who are located in countries outside the European Union. This may happen if our servers or such Recipients or their servers are based outside the European Union. If you use our services and products while visiting countries outside the European Union or if we transfer your PII to Recipients or Recipients which have their servers located outside the European Union, you hereby consent to said transfer of your PII. The data protection and other laws of these countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the European Union − in these instances we will take steps to ensure that a similar level of protection is given to your PII.</p><h2>Retention</h2>
<p>Your PII will not be stored for any longer period than is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.</p><h2>Information about us
