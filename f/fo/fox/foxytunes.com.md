## INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

Yahoo! does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Yahoo! under confidentiality agreements.

However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

In addition, we may provide your personal information to a Yahoo! affiliate worldwide for the general purposes described above under “Information Collection and Use.” For example, various Yahoo! affiliates may be responsible for processing and storing your information in order to deliver content and services to you. In these situations your information may be subject to the legal jurisdiction of these countries.
  * We respond to disclosure demands if permitted or required by law including responding to warrants, subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities including suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Yahoo!'s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. We transfer information about you if Yahoo! is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Yahoo! will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.



Yahoo! displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. 

  * Yahoo! does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 
  * Yahoo! advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). 



Yahoo! works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.
