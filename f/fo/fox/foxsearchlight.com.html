General</u>:&nbsp; Fox FE collects personally identifiable information (<b>"PII"</b> 
-- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address

When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the 
information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, 
contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in connection with 
content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because 
you want us to furnish you with products, services or information.&nbsp; We may also 
obtain PII from reputable third parties. &nbsp;</span></p>

personalized home page or can track the items you have placed in your "shopping

Fox FE sites and other non-personally identifiable information about you may

us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find
