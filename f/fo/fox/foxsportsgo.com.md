## 1\. Scope and Application 

This privacy policy describes the treatment of information provided or collected on the Fox Sports Go sites and applications where this privacy policy is posted, whether on our digital properties or on applications we make available on third-party sites or platforms (collectively, the 'Services'). By using the Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

As set forth in our [**Terms of Use**](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use), the Services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. This Privacy Policy applies to our collection and use of information that identifies you, such as your full name or email address. It also describes generally our practices for handling information such as interests, demographics and Services usage.

## 2\. Collection of Information 

When you access and interact with the Services, Fox Sports Go ('we' or 'us') and our service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Services, our servers may receive and record information about your computer, device and browser, including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data (including your precise location), or other transactional information for that device in order to provide the Services to it.

 **Information Collected from Other Sources.** To improve the quality of the Services, we and our service providers may supplement the information we collect via the Services with information from other sources, such as information that is publicly or commercially available and information from affiliates or business partners.

 **Tracking Technologies.** Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data may also be used. Websites, apps, and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website, app or other service can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website, app or other service.

  *  _We and Our Service Providers_. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such as pages you have visited, the videos and other content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen. Cookies may also be used by us or by our service providers to collect and store information on your use of other companies' websites or services, such as sites you visit and materials you view. We may merge this data with other data we collect about you from third parties to assist us in our ability to provide the Services, including, without limitation, to advertise and provide content to you. Our work in this respect is compliant with the Digital Advertising Alliance's Principles for the Self-Regulation of Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more, visit [**www.aboutads.info/choices**](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).
  *  _Third Parties._ Third parties that support the Services by, for example, serving advertisements may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Services or third party services. These third parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. We do not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled 'To deliver relevant advertisements,' below.



Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the 'Help' section of your browser for more information. You can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available on Adobe's [**website**](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html). Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the Services.

 **Nielsen.** The Services that enable you to view video content may feature Nielsen's proprietary measurement software, which will allow you to contribute to market research, like Nielsen's TV Ratings. The information is collected directly by Nielsen's software within the applicable Service. We make no representation or warranty to you regarding the Nielsen software. To learn more about Nielsen's digital measurement products and your choices in regard to them, please visit [**www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy**](http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy). If you do not wish to participate in Nielsen's digital measurement research, please visit [**http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy#choice**](http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy#choice) to learn more about your choices and how to opt-out.

 **Do Not Track.** At this time we do not respond to browser 'Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.

## 3\. Notice and Choice

If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information ' including data from cookies and other tracking technologies ' processed in the United States. United States data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.

 **Linked Services.** The Services may also be linked to sites and apps operated by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by those third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties, and once you leave the Services via a link, enable a third-party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party service. In addition, we are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of other organizations, such as Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other app developer, app provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including in connection with any information you may disclose to other organizations through or in connection with the Services.
