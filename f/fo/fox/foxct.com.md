**Important Information for California Residents**  
This section applies to California residents whose personal information may be collected by us and/or our affiliates that are businesses subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“ **CCPA** ”).  It describes how we collect, use and share their Personal Information offline and online in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.  For purposes of this section, “ **Personal Information** ” has the meaning given in the CCPA but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.

Your California privacy rights. As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.

    * Whether we’ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.
  * Access. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.

  * emailing privacy@tegna.com


  * **Right to opt out of the “sale” of your Personal Information.** California law classifies the use and operation of a wide range of common online advertising services as a “sale” of your Personal Information because they collect, use and share information about your device and online activity to help tailor online ads that may be of more interest to you.

**Personal information that we collect, use and share**

The chart below summarizes how we collect, use and share Personal Information by reference to the statutory categories specified in the CCPA, and describes our practices during the 12 months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy.

**Do Not Sell My Personal Information**

Like many companies online, we use services provided by Google, Facebook and others that help deliver interest-based ads to you. California law may classify our use of these services as a “sale” of Personal Information from which California residents have the right to opt-out. This is because the companies that provide the services collect information from our users (e.g., device data and online activity data) to help them serve ads that they think users may want to see based on their online activity. These ads are known as interest-based advertisements. Your choices for opting-out of use of your Personal Information by these companies for interest-based advertising include:

**Blocking cookies in your browser**. Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based advertising. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings. Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org.](https://allaboutcookies.org/)

**Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings**. Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.

**Using privacy plug-ins or browsers**. You can block our site from setting cookies used for interest-based ads by using a browser with privacy features, like [Brave](https://brave.com/), or installing browser plugins like [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) or [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), and configuring them to block third party cookies/trackers.

**Platform opt-outs**. The following advertising partners offer opt-out features that let you opt-out of use of your information for interest-based advertising:

  * Google: [https://adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/)
  * Facebook:[ https://www.facebook.com/about/ads](https://www.facebook.com/about/ads)



**Advertising industry opt-out tools**. You can also use these opt-out options to limit use of your information for interest-based advertising by participating companies:

  * Digital advertising Alliance: [http://optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/)
  * Network Advertising Initiative: <http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1>
