FOX SPORTS SOUTH PRIVACY POLICY

Effective as of October 28, 2009. 

Fox Sports Net, Inc. (“FSN,” “we,” “us”) is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles (the “Principles”) (http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. FSN has implemented those Principles in this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information (“PII”) we obtain online and offline from and about individuals located in the U.S. 

The Fox Sports South web site (www.foxsportssouth.com) and all other related web sites owned or controlled by FSN (the “Site”) is a general audience web site, and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. 

Our Privacy Policy applies to "Visitors,” which means that you simply browse the Site, “Subscribers,” which means that you have subscribed to: (i) receive one or more FSN newsletter, email alerts or partner emails; and/or (ii) receive FSN Mobile Alerts, and "Members," which means that you have registered with FSN. The term "User" refers to a Visitor, Subscriber or a Member. By using the Site, you signify your agreement with all the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to those web sites that do not display or link to this Privacy Policy or that have their own privacy statements.

From time to time FSN may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices or the features of the Site or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, FSN will post those changes in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of such Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after FSN posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If FSN materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change. In the event the last e-mail address you provided to us is not valid or is not capable of delivering the notice to you, FSN’s dispatch of an e-mail containing the notice to that e-mail address shall nonetheless constitute effective notice.

A. COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PII BY FSN

1\. General. When FSN collects PII, such as your full name, email address, physical address or mobile number from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting PII to us in order to register as a Member or a Subscriber, or to participate in activities like creating a personal profile (“Your Profile”), sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties or supplement PII that we have collected directly from our Users with additional PII or non-PII from reputable third parties. 

You may also choose to voluntarily provide or store non-PII information in Your Profile (as described in Section A.1 (a) below) or provide or store non-PII information on other public forums provided on the Site, including but not limited to, text, files, images, photos, video, musical works, works of authorship, or any other materials (collectively “Content”) that you choose to post to the Site (Content posted by any User is "User Content"). If you choose to make Your Profile or any information from Your Profile public or provide any User Content on other public forums provided on the Site, you do so at your sole discretion and risk. 

Members can change their Registration Data (as defined below in Section A(1)(a)) and Your Profile information at any time and can control how Visitors and FSN communicate with them by controlling their account settings, available within the “Edit Profile” portion of Your Profile. 

FSN collects information from you at several different points on the Site in the manner set forth below:

(a). Member Registration and Profile: In order to access certain information and services on the Site, you must first become a Member by completing the FSN registration credentials. During the registration process you will be required to provide registration data, which may include PII such as your name and e-mail address (such information is the “Registration Data”). The Registration Data will automatically become incorporated into Your Profile; however, in the Your Profile section of the Site, you have the option to make such Registration Data (including, but not limited to, your PII) public or private. You also have the option of adding certain User Content to Your Profile. 

Important Information about Changing and Updating Your Profile: If Your Profile information changes, you may correct, update, edit, or remove it. You can edit Your Profile information by going to the Your Profile page and clicking on the “Edit my Profile” button.

 (b). Newsletters; Mobile Alerts: During the subscription process you will be required to provide subscriber data, which may include your e-mail address, zip code and mobile number (such information is the “Subscriber Data”). If you would like to subscribe or unsubscribe from any FSN newsletter or FSN Mobile Alerts please refer to our Terms of Use for more information.

(c) Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions:  On the Site you may have the opportunity to participate in contests and other promotions that may require you to provide information about yourself. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy (See Section D (Use) below) we will not share your contest information with any third party, except in aggregate form, without your prior consent. In addition, if and when we sponsor contests or other promotions, or third parties sponsor such promotions with us; either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes, contest or promotion. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular sweepstakes, contest or promotion—please remember to read it carefully.

2\. Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that the Site places on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on the Site and enable FSN to make your visits to the Site more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your password for easy logon to a Site you have previously visited, can save your preferences for a personalized home page. Information about your activities on the Site and other non-PII about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.

Third party advertisements displayed on the Site may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. FSN does not control these cookies and visitors to the Site should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. (See Section B (Notice) below for more information on third party advertisements). 

FSN may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the Site to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the Site may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if FSN wishes to combine your PII and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being set or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you may not have access to certain features on the Site, or contests.

A pixel tag is a tiny image inserted in a webpage and used to record the number and types of views for that page. FSN may allow third party pixel tags to be present on the Site for purposes of advertising, providing services or data and statistics collection. We also may use pixel tags in order to recognize Users and assess traffic patterns, and we may include pixel tags and cookies in our e-mail messages, including newsletters, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened. 

3\. Message Boards and Public Forums: The public forums and similar features offered on the Site are for public and not private communications, and you have no expectation of privacy with regard to any PII or other information posted, submitted or distributed on or through a public forum.  FSN cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose through any of the public forums available on the Site and you make such disclosures at your own risk. 

B. NOTICE: FSN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When you voluntarily provide PII to FSN, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses FSN will make of the information.

At the time you provide your PII, FSN will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See Section C (Choice) below). This Privacy Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your PII, provided you have given FSN permission to do so (See Section D (Use) below).

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in an off-line or manual format, such as by mobile phone. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Privacy Policy and other relevant information from us.

The Site may be linked to Internet web sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party web sites may be co-branded with a FSN logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by FSN (for example, the co-sponsored chat pages, advertising sponsor pages or Site Product purchase pages). The Site also carries advertisements from other companies. FSN is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to the Site, for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies or for third party payment processing companies selected by FSN. Once you leave a FSN Site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, FSN’s Privacy Policy no longer applies and you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser web site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

The Site may also be linked to web sites operated by companies affiliated with FSN (i.e., that are part of the News America Group). Although all News America Group entities adhere to the group’s Privacy Principles (http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html), visitors to those affiliated web sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

Some of the advertisements that appear on FSN’s Site are delivered to you by national Internet advertising companies such as Doubleclick and/or by third party video player providers.  These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to the Site, including information about the banner ads they display, any cookie they place on your computer and your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit:

C. CHOICE: FSN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII

FSN will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted unless otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy (See Section D (Use) below). FSN will not share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with FSN (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission or as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy (See Section D (Use) below). 

D. USE: FSN’S USE OF PII

FSN will use your PII provided under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If FSN obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that PII is governed by this Privacy Policy. 

Unless a User has opted out of receiving such e-mails during the registration process, FSN may occasionally send Users who provide us with their e-mail addresses information about special offers, Site updates, contests and other offerings via e-mail. We may also send information about products and offerings of our partners or other News America Group companies that we think may be of interest to our Members and Subscribers. To opt out of receiving these partner e-mails from us please visit: FSSouth.Privacy@fox.com.    
FSN may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, are part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, FSN may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with FSN, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, FSN may share your PII with the companies who supply prizes for FSN’s contests and may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to FSN users. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties when PII is collected.  

FSN employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. FSN may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities but they may only use your PII to provide FSN with a specific service and not for any other purpose. For example, if you subscribe to FSN Mobile Alerts, your mobile number will be shared with our mobile alerts service provider and your mobile carrier; and if you enter a sweepstakes on the Site your PII may be shared with our sweepstakes administrators. 

FSN may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows FSN to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Site. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on the Site may be shared with these companies so this customization may be accomplished. We require that these companies do not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with FSN’s advertisers and business partners.

There may be instances when FSN may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of FSN, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to the Site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if FSN sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, FSN may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

E. SECURITY: FSN PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII

FSN uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, FSN uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. However, no security system is impenetrable. FSN cannot warrant or guarantee the security of its servers, nor can it guarantee that information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to FSN over the Internet.

F. ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII

Whenever possible, Members and Subscribers may review the PII we maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a Member or Subscriber informs us of in writing is incorrect. If you are a Member, you can view, change and remove your PII, Member preferences and Your Profile information by logging into your account and accessing “Edit Profile.” Section A (1) (b) above describes how to change your subscriptions preferences. 

If for any reason you want FSN to stop using your PII, FSN will honor that request; however, FSN will retain any record of your PII that is necessary to comply with applicable federal, state or local law. Keep in mind, moreover, that there will be residual information that will remain within FSN's databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such PII. Even after removal of PII and User Content by you or FSN, PII and User Content may still be viewable in cached and archived pages or if another User has stored your User Content.

If you would like to communicate with us about this Privacy Policy or FSN’s collection or use of your PII, or request FSN delete your PII, please contact FSN at:
