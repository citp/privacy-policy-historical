# FOX Broadcasting Company: Privacy Policy

FOX Broadcasting Company ("FBC") is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of [Privacy Principles](http://newscorp.com/privacy.html) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. FBC has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. both online and off-line.

FBC does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.

From time to time FBC may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our web sites, or technology. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.

_**COLLECTION:** COLLECTION OF PII BY FBC_

_General_. FBC collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards; or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.

_Cookies_. Cookies are small bits of information that the Internet sites operated by FBC place on the hard drive of your computer. FBC uses cookies to identify your Internet browser and to determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed to access certain material on our web site(s). However, FBC does not use cookies or similar tools to collect or otherwise record any type of PII provided by or about any FBC web site visitor. 

Third party advertisements displayed on Internet site(s) operated by FBC may also contain cookies. FBC does not control these advertiser cookies and visitors to our web site(s) should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.

On occasion, FBC may use cookies or similar tools to relate your use of our web site(s) to personally identifiable information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or other information about your online activities may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we know you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if FBC wishes to coordinate your personal and web site activity information in this manner, we will obtain your express prior consent (i.e., "opt in").

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you may not have access to certain features on FBC's web site(s).

_**NOTICE:** FBC WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES_

When FBC collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses FBC will make of the information. 

This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personal information (See "Use" below). However, FBC will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable information, including whether we can share it with outside companies, typically at the time of collection (See "Choice" below). 

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.

FBC's web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with an FBC logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by FBC. FBC's web site(s) also carry advertisements from other companies as well as advertisements placed by national Internet ad agencies. Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, FBC is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our site(s) or for the privacy practices of third party or so-called national Internet advertising companies. Once you've left an FBC site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

FBC's web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by our business partners or by other companies that are part of the News America Group. Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.

_**CHOICE:** FBC WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII_

FBC will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted. You will also be able to choose whether your information is shared with companies that are not affiliated with FBC (i.e., not part of the News America Group of companies).

_**USE:** FBC'S USE OF PII_

FBC will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other uses are disclosed and you allow us to use your information in other ways. FBC may use PII in aggregate, anonymous form for research purposes. In most instances, FBC will delete PII from its records as soon as possible; for example, sweepstakes entry information will be retained only until a winner is selected or for as long as the law requires.

FBC may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us (i.e., part of the News America Group of companies). FBC may also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with FBC, but would like to send you information about their products and services, such as sponsors of promotions, sweepstakes or programs that appear on the FOX Network. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with unaffiliated third parties.

FBC employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) must comply with FBC's instructions with respect to PII, and may only use PII to provide FBC with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

If FBC obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our subsequent use of this information is governed by this Policy.

There may be instances when FBC may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of FBC, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if FBC sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, FBC may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

_**SECURITY:** FBC PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII_

FBC uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, FBC uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.

  
_**ACCESS, REMEDIES AND COMPLIANCE:** HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII AND HOW TO CONTACT FBC ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS_

Whenever possible, visitors to FBC may review the PII we maintain about them in our records. We will not be able to provide such access to PII that we plan to delete from our records as soon as we are allowed to by law. However, prior to such deletion we will not use that PII except for the purpose for which it was submitted. We will also take reasonable steps to correct any PII a visitor informs us is incorrect. 

If you would like to communicate to us about this Privacy Policy or FBC's collection and use of your PII, to review, correct or delete your PII, or to stop all future communication from us, please contact FBC's Privacy Officer, Ms. Carolyn Gray at:
