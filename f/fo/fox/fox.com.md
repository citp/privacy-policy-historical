## 1\. INTRODUCTION

FOX Broadcasting Company ("FOX" or "we") operates FOX.com and other FOX show and entertainment websites that are operated by FOX (collectively, the "FOX Website" or "Site"). The services FOX offers include the FOX Websites, applications, community pages and any other features, content, promotions, games or applications offered from time to time by FOX including when accessed via the Internet, mobile or other devices (collectively, the "FOX Services"). FOX is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation. 

As set forth in our Terms of Use, the FOX Services are general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. 

This Privacy Policy applies to all "users," including both those who use a FOX Service without being registered with FOX or subscribing to a FOX Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to any FOX Service. This Privacy Policy describes FOX's collection and use of users' personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly available on the FOX Services. We also provide information on the FOX Privacy Settings and describe generally FOX's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account. 

## 2\. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE FOX SERVICES

_User Submitted Information_

**Registration Information** is the information that users must provide to FOX at registration for or upon subscription to a FOX Service, for example, to create an account or profile, enter a contest or sweepstakes, receive a newsletter, play a game or take a survey. Registration Information may include, for example, name, username, email address and birthday. 

**Public Information and Posts** consist of your username and, if you provide one, your profile picture and your posts and comments on or in connection with the FOX Services outside of your profile. Your posts and comments outside of your profile include those made on other user's profiles, on Site or other FOX Service photos, in general Site or other FOX Service areas, such as community forums and on third party websites and services if connected to a FOX Service. 

**Profile Content** consists of information a user may add to the user's profile on the FOX Services. For example, for the FOX Websites' community profile, it includes a user's information such as "Status" and "About Me", and content such as photos, as well as the user's blog, friends, comments and other similar information. You may also be able to set up a profile in connection with another FOX Service, for example, an application, game or reward program. 

**Third Party Information and Content.** If you access a FOX Service through a third party connection or log-in, your user submitted information may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that third party service, any information/content you have permitted the third party to share with FOX, and any information you have made public in connection with that third party service (collectively, "Third Party Information and Content"). Third Party Information and Content obtained in this manner will be governed by this Privacy Policy, any applicable policy of the third party and the terms of use for the FOX Service.

_FOX Collected Information_

**Transactional and Site Activity Information.** When users access the FOX Services, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the FOX Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the FOX Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We may also use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe flash technology), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your usage of the FOX Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. FOX may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the FOX Services to personal information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the FOX Websites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. 

Third parties that support the FOX Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as providing users with the ability to comment on content, allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site usage statistics may also use these technologies to collect similar information. FOX does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see www.aboutads.info.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies>). Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see <http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html>. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the FOX Services. 

**Third Parties.** To improve the quality of our services, FOX may supplement the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties. If you access a FOX Service through a third party connection or log-in, we may also collect Third Party Information and Content. 

## 3\. NOTICE & CHOICE

FOX will not use your personal information in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your permission. 

**Privacy Policy Changes.** FOX may modify this Privacy Policy as necessary. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you to seek your consent either through a email or a prominent posting at our FOX Services. In the event the last email address you provided to FOX is not valid or is not capable of delivering the notice to you, FOX's dispatch of an email containing the notice to that e-mail address shall nonetheless constitute effective notice. 

**Location of Data Storage.** The FOX Services are hosted in the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information you provide transferred to and processed in the United States. U.S. data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.

**Linked Services.** FOX Services may also be linked to sites or services operated by FOX affiliates (i.e., that are part of the News America Group: "Affiliated Companies") or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, rewards programs, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by third parties including, the online store. FOX is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave FOX Services via a link, enable a third party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site. Additionally, although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the News Corporation corporate Privacy Principles, users who visit an Affiliated Company site should still refer to its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.
