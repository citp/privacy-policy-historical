(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>General</u>:&nbsp; Fox FE collects personally identifiable information 
(<b>"PII"</b> -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, 
mailing address or telephone number) in order to create or enhance our 
relationship with you.&nbsp; When we collect PII from you it is because you are 
voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in 
activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription 
registrations, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats 
or bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, 
services or information.&nbsp; We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties. 
&nbsp;(b) <u>Cookies</u>:&nbsp; Cookies are small bits of information that the Fox FE web 
sites place on the hard drive of your computer.&nbsp; Cookies remember information 
about your activities on our site(s) and enable Fox FE to make your visits to 
our site(s) more enjoyable.&nbsp; For example, cookies can store your password for 
easy log-on to a site you have previously visited, can save your preferences for 
a personalized home page or can track the items you have placed in your 
"shopping cart" during a visit to our online store.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Fox FE 
may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our web site(s) to PII 
obtained from you or a reputable third party.&nbsp; For example, if you've asked us 
to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie 
and/or click stream data about your activities on Fox FE’s web site(s) may allow 
us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find 
interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.&nbsp; However, if 
Fox FE wishes to coordinate your personal and web site activity information in 
this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent. &nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">You can 
program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse 
cookies completely.&nbsp; However, without cookies you won't have access to certain

time you provide your PII, Fox FE will notify you of your options regarding our 
use of your PII, including whether we will share it with outside companies (See 
"Choice" below). This Policy describes the types of other companies that may 
want to send you information about their products and services and therefore 
want to share your personal information, provided you have given Fox FE 
permission to do so (See "Use" below).&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Sometimes 
we collect PII from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card 
or subscription form.&nbsp; Providing detailed notice in those situations often 
proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice 
that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant 
information from us.</font></span></p>

applicable privacy policy of the third-party site to determine how they will 
handle any PII they collect from you.</font></span></p>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Fox FE

instruct us not to share your information with third parties at the time of 
collection.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Fox FE 
employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to 
obtain access to your PII.&nbsp; Fox Fe may share your PII with outside contractors 
or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes 
administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may only use 
PII to provide Fox FE with a specific service and not for any other purpose.&nbsp; 
Fox FE uses a third party vendor to distribute e-mails and to collect and store 
consumer registration information.&nbsp;<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.rsvp0.net/">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">There may 
be instances when Fox FE may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in 
order to protect the legal rights of Fox FE, other companies within the News 
America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety 
and security of visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk 
management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if 
Fox FE sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets 
or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Fox FE may transfer 
your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Fox FE 
uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to 
safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use,

online newsletter or receive other online communications from Fox FE.&nbsp; In these 
instances Fox FE will also obtain a parent's email address along with the 
child's.&nbsp; Before any further contact with the child, Fox FE will send an email 
to the parent (A) notifying him or her we have collected the child's email 
address in order to respond more than once to the child's request for a 
subscription, information, etc.; (B) informing the parent that he or she can

the parent that if he or she does not respond to the email within one (1) week, 
Fox FE may use the child's information for the purpose for which it was

Before using this information for any purpose, we will send the parent an email 
that (A) informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child's PII and 
need the parent's consent to do so, and (B) provides the parent with a link to 
access this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use 
policies as required by COPPA.&nbsp; Fox FE will ask the parent to provide consent by
