<h4>5.	DATA SECURITY</h4>

<p>We are, through technical and organisational means, committed to ensuring the security of, and prevention of unauthorised access to, your personal data. For example, we limit who can access your personal data to those individuals and third parties who need to know it and who are subject to a duty of confidentiality. If we become aware of a data breach we will, where we are required to, notify the Information Commissioner's Office. If we believe that the data breach is serious, we may notify you as well.</p>

<h4>6.	INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS </h4>

<p>We will not transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, except to a country offering the same level of protection for your personal data.  For example, with certain service providers we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which ensures that your personal data has the same protection as it would have in Europe.</p>

<h4>7.	DATA RETENTION</h4>

<p>We will retain your personal data whilst you use our services (or whilst we provide services connected to you) and for at least seven years thereafter, for legal, regulatory and accounting purposes. If we need to retain your personal data for longer, we will take into consideration the potential risks in continuing to store your data against why we might need to keep it. In some circumstances we might anonymise your personal data so it is not associated with you, and we may then use this information indefinitely.</p>

<h4>8.	YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4>

<p>To the extent provided by law, you have the right to:</p>

<ul class="default">
	<li>access a copy of the the personal data that we hold and process about you. You have rights to the following information:
		<ul class="default">
	<li>the purpose(s) for which we are processing your information;</li>
	<li>the categories of personal information we hold about you</li>
	<li>the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed;</li>
	<li>the period for which we will store your information, or the criteria used to determine that period;</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>object to the use of your personal data (including for marketing purposes) by 
		<ul class="default">
	<li>informing a Foxtons telephone operator; or </li>
	<li>by ticking the relevant boxes on the data collection forms; or </li>
	<li>by logging into your ‘myfoxtons’ account (if you have done) and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences; or </li>
	<li>by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@foxtons.co.uk">privacy@foxtons.co.uk</a> </li>
</ul>

Please note that even if you refuse marketing, we will still contact you to discuss the services you have asked us to provide to you or to tell you about changes to our terms and conditions:<br><br></li>
	<li>rectification of any inaccurate information we hold about you;</li>
	<li>erasure of the personal data we hold about you (in certain situations);</li>
	<li>ask that we do not make decisions about you using completely automated means; and/or</li>
	<li>ask that personal data we hold about you is, where technically feasible, transmitted to a third-party chosen by you, in a commonly used, machine-readable format.</li>

</ul>

<p>The rights listed above may not apply in certain circumstances. Therefore we may not always be able to comply with your request. We will tell you if this is the case.  We will usually respond to a request from you to exercise your rights within one month of receipt, but it might take longer if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. Please be aware that we may need to process your personal data and/or request specific information from you to help us comply with your request. Generally, you do not have to pay a fee to exercise these rights, but you may have to pay a fee if your request is  unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request.</p>

<h4>9. HOW TO CONTACT US</h4>

<p>We are registered as a Data Controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues. To contact us about how we handle your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@foxtons.co.uk. Alternatively, write to us at Data Protection Officer, Foxtons Limited, Building One, Chiswick Park, 566 Chiswick High Road, London, W4 5BE. If you have a complaint about the way in which your personal data has been processed you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner's Office but you may be required to first complete our internal complaints procedure.</p>

<h3>Money Laundering</h3>
<p>Foxtons is committed to operating its business in a transparent and open manner consistent with our legal and regulatory obligations. We are aware that the real estate industry is a target for organised criminals seeking to launder the proceeds of criminal activity. We always seek to prevent this activity by cooperating fully with the authorities and reporting suspicious activity to the National Crime Agency.

</p><p>As part of this commitment, we adopt a strict compliance of all Anti-Money Laundering rules, with specific emphasis on the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the Money Laundering Regulations 2017, the Bribery Act 2010 and the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

<p>Foxtons policy commitment is applicable to all of our customers, including vendors, buyers, landlords and tenants. As a result we obtain and hold for a period of at least seven years evidence pertaining to our customers' identity and, where appropriate, we obtain proof of ownership of property and source/destination of funds. We will be unable to proceed with any work on behalf of our customers if we are unable to obtain this information. Customers' identity will be subject to an electronic identity check, which may also include a credit check</p>
