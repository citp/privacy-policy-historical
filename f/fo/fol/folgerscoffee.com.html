					about visitors to our website, use of our online features, and interactions with our emails and online advertisements. For example, through these means, we
					may collect your browser type and operating system, viewed web pages, links that are clicked, IP address, sites visited before coming to our website,

                <p>
                    We also may use third party advertisements placed by ad networks to support our site. Some of these advertisers and ad networks may use technology such as

					use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, search activities on our site and on other third
					party sites, demographic information and/or relevant to your general location, so that the advertising you see on our site more closely reflects your
					interests and needs. For example, if you search for or browse a, recipe or product on our site, you may see an advertisement from a third party with
					information about, or an offer similar to, that for which you were searching or browsing on our site, or an offer related to a third party whose site you
					have visited in the past.

					advertising cookies. You can learn more about and opt out from receiving third party advertiser cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s
					opt-out page <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">here</a>. Please note, without cookies or pixel tags, you may not be able to take full
					advantage of all of our website features.

                    — We may obtain information about you from other sources, including commercially available sources, such as data
					aggregators, public databases and other third parties. This information may include name, demographic information, interests, and publicly-observed data,
					such as from social media and shopping behavior. For example, if you are on another website, and you opt in to receive information from us, that website
					will forward to us your email address and other information about you so we may contact you as requested. We may combine this information with the
					information we collect from you to help us tailor our communications to you and to improve our services and products.

            <div>
                <p>
                    <u>Personally-Identifiable Information</u>
                    — We may share information among our various businesses and brands within The Folger Coffee Company and its
					subsidiaries. We may provide your personal information to third parties who provide services on our behalf. For example, we use an outside shipping company
					to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill for goods. We use other third parties to provide promotions, contests, newsletters and
					hosting for our site. These service providers may use the information solely in conjunction with the specific services they provide for us. These service
					providers are not authorized to use, share, retain or store your personally-identifiable information for any other purpose. We may conduct joint promotions
					with other companies, and may share with these promotional partners (and their service providers) personally-identifiable information necessary to conduct
					the promotion. We may also use and disclose personally-identifiable information where we think it is necessary to investigate or prevent actual or expected
					fraud, or criminal activity or injury or damage to us or others, including when requested or required by law enforcement or government officials. We will
					not share personally-identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties. For California residents, please see Opting Out, below.
                </p>
                <p>

                    — We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers
					who perform services on our behalf. This information does not identify individual users. We do this for online data analysis and research purposes to help
					provide our users with relevant tool and features. We do not link aggregate user data with personally-identifiable information.

                </div>
			<h3>OPTING OUT</h3>
				<div>
				<p>
					<u>Your Choices</u> 
					— As discussed above, we provide you with the option to receive marketing and promotional materials. If you no longer wish to receive our
					newsletters and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or by    <a href="http://www.folgerscoffee.com/folgers-unsubscribe/">clicking here</a>.

                    <u>For California Residents</u>
                    — We may share your personally-identifiable information with affiliated third parties, some of which do not share the name of The
					Folger Coffee Company, for their own direct marketing purposes. Because this category of affiliates is considered to be “unaffiliated parties” under
					California Law, you may opt out of us sharing with them. To opt out, please send a letter with your name, postal address, e-mail, with the heading
