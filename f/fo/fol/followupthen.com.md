# Privacy Policy | FollowUpThen

#### Our Policy

Welcome to the website (the " **Site** ") of FollowUpThen, Inc. (" **FollowUpThen** ", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by FollowUpThen and has been created to provide information about our company and its reminder services (together with the Site, the " **Services** ") to our Service visitors ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth FollowUpThen’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (" **Personal Data** ") and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services. 

#### A Note About Email Content:

Our Service allows users to forward emails to our Service for the purpose of setting automated reminders associated with those emails. We recognize that your emails may be very private, and we take special care with them. For example, we encrypt the message body of these emails using industry-standard methodologies while they are stored on our servers. We store the content of these emails for the period of time required in order to send you the requested reminder. After the requested reminder period has expired and the Service has sent the reminder, we delete the message body, message text and attachments from our servers within six (6) weeks. For example, if you forward an email to 5months@followupthen.com, we retain the complete email information for five (5) months plus six (6) weeks (providing the followup was not postponed). With respect to other email-related information, we retain the subject heading of these emails for the sole purpose of performing internal quality assurance and de-bugging and providing records of followups sent and received on users’ account pages. We also retain certain non-personally identifiable information related to these emails (for example, date sent, email configuration, name of the email provider), for the purpose of improving our Services and as described below in the "Non-Identifiable Data" section. 

#### Information We Collect:

When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below: 

  * **Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:**

We collect Personal Data (like name, email address and telephone number) from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the FollowUpThen Services or use certain FollowUpThen Services. Wherever FollowUpThen collects Personal Data, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. 

  * **Personal Data of Non-Users:**

The Service may allow users to enable reminders for the people with whom they communicate. As part of this service, we will collect the email address(es) provided by our users in order to provide this feature. We use the email addresses of non-users only in connection with providing the requested feature (for example, to send the reminder as requested by one of our users). If you are not a user of our Service and do not wish to receive a reminder from the Services, please click the opt out link in the reminder email that you receive. If you do opt-out, we will keep your email address on file for the sole purpose of ensuring we never contact you without your permission. If you do not opt out from the reminder, then we will delete your email address and the applicable email within the time period described above in the Section called “A Note About Email Content.” 

  * **Personal Data of Non-Users:**

The Service may allow users to enable reminders for the people with whom they communicate. As part of this service, we will collect the email address(es) provided by our users in order to provide this feature.

#### Other Information:

  * **Non-Identifiable Data:**

When you interact with FollowUpThen through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. FollowUpThen may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by FollowUpThen affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the languages of users, time zones, location, name of the email client, the configuration of the email client, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.   
In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, the Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services’ features. 

  * **Location Information:**

Our Service may collect and use your location information to provide certain functionality of our Service (for example, associating a reminder with a particular location). We may also use your location information in an aggregate way, as described below in the “Aggregated Personal Data” section. 

  * **Aggregated Personal Data:**

In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the FollowUpThen Services, FollowUpThen often conducts research on its user demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and FollowUpThen may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners.

FollowUpThen may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

Such interactions are limited to only technical support and system administration instances.   
If your Personal Data is provided by others using the Service, your Personal Data is used only in connection with the Services (for example, to provide you with the reminders others schedule for you).
