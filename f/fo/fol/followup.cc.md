# Followup Software

You should know:

* We collect limited account information to maintain your account, contacts, reminders, and notes on our servers.   
* We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes without your express permission.   
* You can update your account information and preferences at any time.

To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time FollowUp Personal CRM is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, please do not use the FollowUp Personal CRM service.

## What types of personal information do we collect and how do we use it?

**Account information**. When you register with FollowUp Personal CRM, we will request some personal information, including your email address and name from Google via Oauth authentication. Your grants and information are stored securely and never distributed.

**Google API Access**. When you register with FollowUp Personal CRM, we will ask you to grant us access to the Gmail, Contacts, and Calendar API's on your behalf. FollowUp Personal CRM requires these permissions so that we can provide you with features like scheduling calendar events from Gmail, importing your Google contacts for use into FollowUp Personal CRM, and letting you know when the last time was that you interacted with a Contact via email. We do store Calendar Event/Gmail metadata on our servers on Google's Cloud platform. Additionally, your Google Contact's full information including their avatars is synced to your FollowUp Personal CRM address book.

**Contacts, Notes, and Reminder contents and usage**. The contents of your FollowUp Personal CRM account are stored and maintained on FollowUp Personal CRM servers in order to provide the service. Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of reminders may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account. FollowUp Personal CRM employees do not access the content of any contacts, reminders, or notes unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect FollowUp Personal CRM or the public.

We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your registration and use of FollowUp Personal CRM. Information displayed or clicked on in your FollowUp Personal CRM account (including UI elements, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the FollowUp Personal CRM user interface.

FollowUp Personal CRM will never sell, rent or share your personal information with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.

## Cookies & log information

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer when you first visit a website. As with most website cookies, our cookies include an identification number that is unique to the computer you are using. This identifier helps us better understand our user base and how they are using our site and services.

When you visit FollowUp Personal CRM and create a FollowUp Personal CRM account, we set and access cookies on your computer. We use cookies for a number of reasons, such as recognizing you when you visit the site, displaying the site according to your chosen user settings for language, and maintaining the security of your account. We may also use the cookies to collect aggregated information about the use of FollowUp Personal CRM to maintain, analyze and improve the service. If you set your browser so that it refuses cookies, you will not be able to use the FollowUp Personal CRM service.

**Log information**   
When you use your FollowUp Personal CRM account, we collect certain information (the same information that most web sites log when they are accessed). This information, contained in the "header" of your request to access the FollowUp Personal CRM page, usually includes the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. In addition, we log the unique ID provided by our cookie and the URL of the last site you visited.

As a basic matter, we need this information to help us provide our services to you. For example, we need to validate your identity in order to maintain the security of your reminders. We also need to know what Internet Protocol address your query came from so we can send the appropriate pages back to you.

In addition, we log this information for internal business purposes. For example, this log information helps us determine how well our services are working so we can continually improve the quality of FollowUp Personal CRM. The log information is also important for security, audit, quality improvement, and other internal business purposes.

## How we may contact you

FollowUp Personal CRM may send you information related to your FollowUp Personal CRM account or FollowUp Personal CRM services. Because we believe such information is important, you will not be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of FollowUp Personal CRM, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, FollowUp Personal CRM will notify you with an opt-out option before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Terminating your account

You can terminate you account by contacting support . We typically deactivate accounts within two business days of such requests. You should be aware, however, that residual copies of information may remain stored on our systems even after the deletion of information or the termination of your account.
