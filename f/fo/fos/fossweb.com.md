# Fossweb: Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

If you are under 18, be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself (your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet.

This site collects no personally identifying information about you except when you knowingly and specifically provide it to us. Your personally identifying information may be used for our editorial, marketing, and/or promotional purposes. We may also provide your personally identifying information to our parent company, subsidiaries, and/or affiliates and/or carefully screened companies whose products and services might be of interest to you.

The use of "cookies" is common on the Internet. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some portions of this site will not function properly if you do so. If you do not set your browser to refuse cookies, we may place a cookie in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not give us any personally identifying information, although it will enable us to relate your use of our site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to us.

While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined in this policy, we sometimes collect anonymous aggregated data and provide it to our advertisers for statistical purposes. For example, we might tell them that a certain percentage of users live in a certain geographic area.

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on bulletin boards or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other Internet users.

We encourage parents to get involved with their children's on-line usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating.

For questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact Delta Education, Attn.: FOSS Product Development, 80 Northwest Boulevard, P.O. Box 3000, Nashua, NH 03061-3000. We can be reached by e-mail at mbacon@delta-edu.com.
