            Privacy Policy of Fotor

        <p class="marginT10">Last Updated: 27 Jun, 2018</p>
        <p class="marginT10">
               Your privacy is important to Fotor. Our Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and
               store your information and customized user data. We hope our policy is straightforward and easy-to-understand.
         </p>
        <p class="marginT10">
            Please take a few minutes to review the details of our privacy practices below. By using the site and/or
            services of Fotor, you acknowledge and agree that you have consented to the collection, use and
            disclosure practices set out in this Privacy Policy as they relate to your personal information.

        <div class="privacy-title2 open_sans">
            1. Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
        </div>
        <p class="marginT20">
            We may collect non-personal information, such as data that does not allow direct association with any
            specific individual. Non-personal data is collected, used, transferred, and disclosed for a number of
            purposes. These purposes include the use of cookies and other technologies that give us a better
            understanding of our users' needs. A "cookie" is a small data file that is stored on your device.
            Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. We use information collected from cookies to
            improve users' experience and the overall quality of our services.
        </p>

        <p class="marginT20">
            We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our site or use our apps.
            These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone
            number) about your visits to our site and to other websites in order to provide advertisements about
            goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and clear GIFs to measure
            advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and clear GIFs
            is generally not personally identifiable (unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable
            information to them through an ad or e-mail message). We encourage you to read these businesses’ privacy
            policy if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your personal information. If you would
            like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used
            by these companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer website.

            2. Collection and Use of Personal Information

            Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you use any of the products or services
            offered by Fotor. We may prompt you to provide information, including personal information. For example,
            we may ask to collect your name, email address, user name, telephone number and credit card number whenever
            you register for an account, purchase our products, or contact us via email. If you use Fotor as a platform
            to sell or buy copyright protected pictures or to participate in any photo competition, we may require further personal
            information in order to identify you and/or to provide services, in compliance with applicable laws.

        </p>

        <p class="marginT20">

            knowledge base, which will be available to all users of the site. Your correspondence will most
            likely not be used verbatim, but paraphrased in an FAQ format.

            Fotor provides a number of online services allowing users to edit, share and make designs with their photo
            work. In order to better serve the needs of users, we host both the photos you uploaded and the Fotor

           4. Disclosing Your Personal Information
       </div>
        <p class="marginT20">
            We may disclose your personal information to third parties who perform services on our behalf.
            These services include processing of payments/orders, marketing, auditing, etc. Those third parties
            shall only be permitted to obtain the personal information that is absolutely necessary to perform
            their service. They must protect personal information to the same extent as Fotor and shall not use
            the personal information they obtain for any purpose other than the service they provide to Fotor.
        </p>
        <p class="marginT20">
            We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement authorities in the event of assistance
            to prevent, detect or investigate criminal activity. When provided with notification of copyright infringement,
            we may reveal the information of the image provider (seller) to the licensee, copyright owner, judicial or administrative authorities.

            competition sponsor may publish your name and other information such as your city of residence.
        </p>
        <p class="marginT20">
            Customer information, as a whole, including personal information, is stored as part of business assets
            of the company, which may be disclosed in a merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its assets,
            as well as in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, as far as permitted by applicable laws.
