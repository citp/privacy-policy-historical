PRIVACY POLICY 

Your privacy is important to Fotor. Our Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. We hope our policy is straightforward and easy-to-understand. Please take a minute to review the details of our privacy practices below.

COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We may collect non-personal information, such as data that does not allow direct association with any specific individual. Non-personal data is collected, used, transferred, and disclosed for a number of purposes. These purposes include the use of cookies and other technologies that give us a better understanding of our users' needs. A "cookie" is a small data file that is stored on your device. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. We use information collected from cookies to improve users' experience and the overall quality of our services.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our site and to other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and clear GIFs to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and clear GIFs is generally not personally identifiable (unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable information to them through an ad or e-mail message). We encourage you to read these businesses’ privacy policy if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your personal information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer website. 

COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION / CONTENT 

Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you use any of the products or services offered by Fotor. We may prompt you to provide information, including personal information. For example, we may ask to collect your name, email address, user name, telephone number and credit card number whenever you register for an account, purchase our products, or contact us via email. If you use Fotor as a platform to sell or buy copyright protected pictures, we may require further personal information in order to identify you and/or to provide services, in compliance with applicable laws.

From time-to-time we may also collect personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, promotional offers, and other activities on the site.

When you use our email support services, we collect your correspondence in order to build up a public knowledge base, which will be available to all users of the site. Your correspondence will most likely not be used verbatim, but paraphrased in an FAQ format.

We use the information collected through Fotor products: (I) to communicate with you; (II) to process your requests and transactions; (III) to improve the site; (IV) to customize the services and/or products we provide to you; (V) to assist with our product and service development; (VI) to perform marketing analysis; and (VII) for other purposes related to our business.

Storage and Host of User Data 

Fotor provides a number of online services allowing users to edit, share and make designs with their photo work. In order to better serve the needs of users, we host both the photos you uploaded and the Fotor projects you started in a secured way. Unless you share or make it public voluntarily, only you can see and revisit these photos and/or the projects by logging into your Fotor account.

TRANSPARENCY AND CHOICE 

You may configure your browser to block cookies, including cookies associated with our services. However, many of our services may not function correctly with cookies disabled. You can also control which social websites you upload images to.

Third party accounts 

Fotor does not store your Facebook, Twitter, or Flickr passwords. Your account information is not disclosed to Fotor and you are free to cancel any of your social networking website connections with Fotor at any time.

ENFORCEMENT 

We regularly review our own compliance with our Privacy Policy. If you submit a formal written complaint, we will contact you and try our best to resolve the issue.

CHANGES 

Our Privacy Policy may change occasionally. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without providing explicit, advanced notice. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, in the event of significant changes, we will provide a more prominent notice (such as an email notification). We will also archive prior versions of this Privacy Policy for your review.

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us .
