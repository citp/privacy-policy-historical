      This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by fotonauts, Inc.("fotonauts", "we" or "us") with respect to your use of the web site located at www.fotopedia.com or other sites as may be owned, managed or controlled by us from time to time (the "Site") so you can make an informed decision about using the Site. <b>We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time.

    <h2>
      WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION?
    </h2>
    <p>
      As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account number), and information about that individual's location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site, when directly linked to personally identifiable information. A user name may be personal information if it includes personally identifying information such as a first and last name. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
