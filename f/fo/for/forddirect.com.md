# FordDirect Privacy Statement

#### INTRODUCTION

At FordDirect, we care about consumer privacy, and we believe in providing transparency to consumers about our information practices. This Privacy Statement explains how FordDirect collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information. 

FordDirect is dedicated to helping visitors to our sites connect with Ford and Lincoln dealers ("Dealers"), Ford Dealership Associations ("Dealer Associations"), and Ford Motor Company (and its affiliates and subsidiaries) to learn about Ford and Lincoln vehicles and related products and services. 

This Privacy Statement applies to the information FordDirect collects about you through websites, applications, social media assets, software, and other services provided by or on behalf of FordDirect. When you access, visit or use the Services, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure and retention of your information as described in this Privacy Statement. 

If a Service is co-branded or developed by a third party or linked to a third party, the third party's privacy statement may apply.

#### HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION

**Information You Provide.** We and our vendors collect the information you voluntarily provide to us in connection with using our Services, including through product inquiries, requests for vehicle information, technical services or questions, product registration and support, events and promotions, job applications, other inquiries and transactions. Our vendors also may collect information from you, including, for example, when you participate in our contests, sweepstakes, surveys, and other promotions. Some portions of the Services may allow you to submit comments, reviews, ratings and other content.

**Information We Obtain from Affiliates, Business Customers and Others.** We may obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, our affiliates, Dealers and Dealer associations that deploy FordDirect products and services, may share with us certain information you have previously provided to them. We also may obtain commercially-available demographic information from third parties. If you engage with us, our affiliates or our business customers via social media, the social media platforms also may share certain information with FordDirect. You may be able to adjust your social media privacy settings to limit the sharing of your social media data.

**Information We Obtain by Automated Means.** We may collect information about your use of our Services or devices you use to connect to the Services by automated means, including tracking technologies. These tracking technologies may include "cookies," which are small lines of text/data that are written onto your computer by a website. FordDirect and vendors acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar technologies to operate the Services. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.

#### DATA COLLECTION BY THIRD PARTIES

Our Services may include third-party advertising, promotions, co-branded features, links to other websites, and other programs offered by or in collaboration with third-party businesses. In addition to collecting information directly from you, these third-party businesses may use web beacons and cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content, and track users who click on the links made available through the Services. When you use our Services, these third-party businesses may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies, which may apply to these third-party programs. Some third-party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their tracking or advertising. For example, they may be members of [the Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) (which manages the privacy choices of its members) or other organizations that offer consumers [privacy choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

#### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

**Information About You.** The information that you provide directly to us and that we obtain from others is what we need to serve you, our affiliates and business customers. This information may include your contact details (such as name, postal or email address, phone number, Twitter handle or other online aliases); details about your vehicle and Dealer transactions; contact information of individuals with whom you would like to share FordDirect content; social media identifiers; demographic information; and other information you may choose to share with us by interacting with our Services or with our affiliates, business customers or other businesses that share information with us.

**Information About Your Device.** The information we collect by automated means also helps us, our affiliates and our business customers to provide and tailor various products and services. We may collect the following details by automated means:

**_Usage Information._** We and our vendors may automatically collect your usage activity, preferences, and browser details (such as your IP address and browser type), as well the ID and type of the device you use to connect to our Services, and other details about your use of our Services. This may also include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. 

**_Online Tracking._** Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not-track ("DNT") mechanisms, FordDirect does not itself respond to web browser-based DNT signals. However, certain of our websites participate in the [AdChoices](http://www.aboutads.info/) program. If the website that you are visiting displays an AdChoices icon, you may click on the icon and follow instructions to adjust your privacy preferences. If you opt-out using AdChoices, our sites that participate in the program will no longer collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for behavioral advertising purposes.

**_Location Data._** Some of our Services may collect geo-location data to provide location-related functionality, such as the location of your nearest Dealer. We may link location data to other information we have collected about you.

We also may use information about your use of our Services to tailor our offers to your preferences or to offer you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.

**Mergers, Acquisitions or Insolvency.** If FordDirect should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if FordDirect should decide to buy, sell, or reorganize some part or all of its business, FordDirect reserves the right to disclose your information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.

**As Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures.** FordDirect may be required to disclose your information if it: 

  * believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority;
