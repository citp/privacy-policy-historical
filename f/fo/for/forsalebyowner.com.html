At ForSaleByOwner.com user privacy is of utmost concern.&nbsp; We are committed to your privacy and security, and to providing you the best possible user experience.&nbsp; We may update this policy from time to time, so please check here frequently. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
What do we mean by privacy?&nbsp;&nbsp; We will never disclose your information to any third party without your consent, except in limited circumstances to our business partners with whom we have established agreements that protect your privacy<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Here's how we collect and use information from you in our efforts to provide the highest quality user experience:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>IP Address </b>- Your IP or "Internet Protocol" address and other site usage data is used to gather broad demographic information.&nbsp; This data helps us serve you by allowing us to understand how visitors use our web sites. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Cookies</b> - Our sites use a technology called "cookies," small files stored by your browser to help keep track of your user profile.&nbsp; Our cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, nor do we share them with anyone.&nbsp; We use cookies to remember your personal profile for your convenience, to deliver content specific to your needs and interests, and to ensure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.&nbsp; We also use cookies to track user trends and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ads</b> - We sometimes use outside companies to display advertising on our web sites.&nbsp; These ads may place cookies on your computer, which are referenced by our ad companies.&nbsp; We do not have access to this information. We use customer contact information from registration forms to send you information related to our products and services if you consent to receiving such mailings.&nbsp; Your contact information may also be used to contact you when necessary for administrative purposes related to your account.&nbsp; We use your email as a unique identifier in our record system, to verify communications from you, and to send you newsletters and promotion offerings that you ask to receive or to tell you about changes to the ForSaleByOwner.com website. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Demographic information and site usage data is also collected on our sites. We use this data to tailor your experience, allowing us to provide content related to your preferences and information on products or services we think you may be interested in.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
