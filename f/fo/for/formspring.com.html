<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
FormSpring respects each individual's right to personal privacy. We
will collect and use information through our Web site only in the ways
disclosed in this statement. Your information is used strictly for
internal purposes, and we will not distribute or sell your information
to a 3rd party.
</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
However, any information collected by FormSpring may be shared if it
is necessary to investigate, prevent or prosecute illegal activities,
suspected fraud, violations to the <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a> ,
or as otherwise required by law or a valid government request
(including but not limited to search warrants, subpoenas, or court
orders).
</p>
<h2>Account Information</h2>
<p>
We collect email addresses from those who contact us via email, and
ask for information such as your email address and name when you sign
up for an account with FormSpring. The information we collect is not
distributed or sold to a 3rd party. It will only be used to communicate
with you about your FormSpring account, and where needed as part of
certain FormSpring features. You may update your account information at
any time.
</p>
<h2>Web Server Logs</h2>
<p>
We also log information on pages users visit on this site for
statistical purposes. Those logs contain standard information collected
by typical web servers, such as client IP addresses, browser types,
etc. This information is only used internally, and is not distributed
or sold to a 3rd party.
</p>
<h2>Application Data</h2>
<p>
As part of the FormSpring service, we store the forms you build and
any data that was collected from those forms. We respect the privacy of
you and your users, and consider all data that is collected to be
private. We will never use the collected data, except to access it for
your sole use within the FormSpring applications. We will never
distribute or sell your form data to a 3rd party. You may choose not to
have your form data stored within the FormSpring database, or may
choose to encrypt the data in the database so that it will be
impossible to access without a password that you specify.
</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
Cookies are required to use the FormSpring service. A cookie is a
small text file containing a unique identifier that our web server
sends to a user's browser, and may be stored on a user's hard drive.
The cookies we use are not permanent.
</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>
FormSpring may update this privacy policy. We will notify registered
users about significant changes by sending a notice to their email
address and by posting the changes on the FormSpring web site.
