      <h1>Privacy and Information Security Policy</h1>
      <p>Foreclosuredeals.com is committed to actively respecting and protecting your personal information in all of our online and offline procedures and processes. This document will explain our Privacy and Information Security Policy, as well as some of the steps we take to maintain your privacy and security when you use our website.</p>      <h2>Types of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>We collect two main types of information from our members. The first type of information we collect includes personal information supplied by members during the registration process. The second type includes information supplied by you when you add a property to our foreclosure listings.</p>      <h2>Personal Information</h2>
      <p>We define personal information as any information about yourself, supplied by you, when either registering as a new member, updating your membership profile, or listing a property for sale, as well as statistical information collected regarding your usage of our website and online services. Statistical website usage information typically includes data such as the length of time you are logged on to our site and which areas of our site you spent the most time viewing or searching. This information helps us to establish usage patterns and adjust our site to bring you a more robust and user-friendly online experience.</p>      <h2>IP Address</h2>
      <p>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is unique to your internet network connection. IP addresses are used to identify both the sender of information as well as the receiver of information. We collect IP addresses only from users that send us an email via our Contact Us pages. We do not report any IP addresses to advertisers.</p>      <h2>Information Security</h2>
      <p>Your security is extremely important to us. Here at Foreclosuredeals.com, we safeguard your personal information using the same secure infrastructure that protects our proprietary property database. Once your username and password information is stored, access is achieved only by Foreclosuredeals.com employees who have access to our secure property database. This security infrastructure is constantly monitored for best practices and updated to meet our high standards of online information protection. Foreclosuredeals.com does not store any of your credit information. All credit information is processed by CCBill's secure credit processing website. Please review CCBill's Privacy Policy by <a href="http://www.ccbill.com/cs/acf/html/privacy_policy-english.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. Foreclosuredeals.com is not responsible for the security practices or policies of any vendors, advertisers, or third-party service providers.</p>      <h2>Nondisclosure</h2>
      <p>Except as noted within this document, or as expressly agreed upon by you, Foreclosuredeals.com does not share or disclose any of your individual personal information with any vendors, advertisers, or third-party service providers. Foreclosuredeals.com is not responsible for the privacy or information disclosure policies of any vendors, advertisers, or third-party service providers.</p>      <h2>Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy</h2>
      <p>Foreclosuredeals.com holds the privacy of our customers and members as one of our chief concerns. Below you will find details on how we strive to keep our customers safe and secure, as well as details on how we handle and protect your personal information.

Information found in a log file includes information about user visits to our page, such as IP address, the type of browser used, your internet service provider, time and date stamps of your visits, number of clicks and page views, and referring and exit pages. This information helps us better understand our user demographic by analyzing trends and tracking where people seem to be going on our site. However, none of this information is linked to any personal information or any other data which may be used to identify individual users. Our log files are kept safe and securely encrypted within our system, and we use them solely for our own informational purposes.</p>
