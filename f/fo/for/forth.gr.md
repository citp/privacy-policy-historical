Purpose and Principles of Personal Data Collection
FORTH collects and processes the personal data of visitors/users exclusively and only with a view to
meeting its purposes and functions and, more specifically, for the purpose of its communication with
you. Processing is limited to personal data that are necessary and appropriate for meeting the purpose
and functions of the website. Processing is subject to the requirements of the General Data Protection
Regulation and the relevant Union law, Greek legislation and international conventions and treaties.
Use of the Personal Data Collected by Us
The personal data we collect from the contact platform available on our website, as well as any other
data that may be sent to us through our profiles on the various social networks, shall be used only for
the needs of our communication with you and for your better service. While navigating on our website,
cookies are used only for the purpose of statistical analysis of the visits to our website. No further
processing, transmission or exchange of these data shall take place. In any event, you are a priori
requested to consent to the above use of your personal data.
Cookies Policy
During users’ navigation on this website, FORTH may collect identification data of users, by using
relevant technologies, such as cookies and/or Internet Protocol (IP) address monitoring. Cookies are
small text segments that are sent to the browser by a website visited by the user. The use of cookies
helps the website to remember information about the user’s visit, such as your preferred language and
your preferences, to make secure searches, to calculate the number of visitors, or to facilitate your
registration in our services.
How to control cookies: You may control and/or delete cookies as you wish. You may find more details
at aboutcookies.org. You may delete all cookies from your computer and, in most browsers, select
settings that do not allow installation of cookies. However, in that case, you may have to adjust certain
preferences every time you visit a website. Users may make use of the website without problems even


without use of cookies, but, potentially, to the detriment of its user-friendliness and of the functioning
of certain of its services.
Any personal data collected via cookies that can be correlated to a specific visitor/user shall be
processed exclusively for the purposes cited above.
For the Newsletter issued by FORTH
A page has been created on FACEBOOK for subscription to the newsletter issued by FORTH

recipients of the newsletter at any time and the data registered for the above purpose shall be deleted.
Data Transmission/Disclosure to Third Parties
The personal data collected may be disclosed or transmitted to third parties, if this is mandatory for
fulfilling legal obligations or necessary for meeting the purposes and functions of the website, subject to
the safeguards provided for by relevant legislation. We may assign to natural or legal persons the task of
performing certain services and functions of the website. Those persons shall receive only personal data
that are necessary for performing the services assigned and are bound by FORTH to the confidentiality
and safe processing of the personal data.
Your Rights Relating to the Processing of Your Data
In accordance with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (679/2016/EU), you have
the right, both during the collection and afterwards, to be informed about any processing of your
personal data, its purpose, as well as the disclosure/transmission to third parties and their identity (right
of information and access). You have also the right to request that your personal data kept by FORTH be
corrected, updated or deleted. You have also the right to have the processing restricted and the right to
object.
In order to receive information and exercise your rights, you may contact the Personal Data Officer at
dpo@admin.forth.gr.
We point out that, in accordance with the Regulation, you have the right to file a complaint to the Data
Protection Authority.
Confidentiality and Security
The personal data we collect within the context of the operation of the website are those strictly
necessary for the purpose of our communication with you. They are strictly confidential and are kept
only for the needs of such communication. Access to these data is provided to very few officers of the
organisation, who have been bound to keeping confidentiality. Moreover, we have adequate security
systems and take all necessary and appropriate organisational and technical measures in order to
prevent any breach of personal data security (leak, disclosure, unauthorised access) in our systems.

This personal data protection policy may change whenever necessary, always in compliance with
national and Union law. For that reason, you are kindly requested to visit this page regularly in order to
be informed. By navigating on and using the FORTH website, visitors/users acknowledge that they have
read, understood and unconditionally accepted the Personal Data Protection Policy.
