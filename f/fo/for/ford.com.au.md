### 1\. Introduction

1.1 Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited ABN 30 004 116 223 (“ **Ford** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **our** ” and “ **us** ”) is committed to responsible privacy practices and to complying with the Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“ **Privacy Act** ”). Where applicable, Ford will handle personal information relying on the related bodies corporate exemption and the employee records exemption in the Privacy Act and any other applicable exemptions in the Privacy Act or other legislation. 

1.2 This Privacy Policy sets out our policies on the management of personal information including how we collect personal information, the purposes for which we use this information, and to whom this information is disclosed. 

1.3 Authorised Ford Dealers (“ **Dealers** ”) are independent entities and not related to Ford and may have privacy policies which differ from ours. Dealers are responsible for their own privacy policies and privacy practices. Please contact your Dealer directly for further information. 

1.4 We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time at our discretion. At any time, the latest version of our Privacy Policy is available from our website at www.ford.com.au or from our Customer Relationship Centre. 

### 2\. What is personal information?

2.1 In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” has the meaning set out in the Privacy Act. Essentially, personal information is information or an opinion about an individual who is reasonably identifiable. 

### 3\. What types of personal information does Ford collect?

3.1 The types of personal information Ford collects from you depend on the circumstances in which the information is collected. 

3.2 Ford may collect contact details including your name, address, email address and phone and fax numbers. 

3.3 Where relevant, Ford may also collect your driver’s licence and registration details, date of birth or age group, occupation, gender, information about your vehicle (including its number plate and vehicle identification number), answers you provide to questions we ask and other information in relation to your dealings with Ford or Dealers (such as types of vehicle purchased and replaced and repair/service history). 

3.4 If you are an individual contractor to Ford, in addition to the information referred to in section 3.3 we may collect information relevant to your engagement with Ford including qualifications, length of engagement, resume, pay rate and salary, bank details, feedback from supervisors, training records and logs of your usage of Ford equipment (e.g. phones, computers and vehicles). A reference to an individual contractor in this document includes those individuals who perform work for Ford under a “purchased service” arrangement. If you are employed by or contracted to a Dealer, we may also collect and maintain training records about you. 

3.5 When using the Ford website, we or our third party service providers may collect web site usage information such as the IP address you are using, the name of your Internet service provider, your browser version, the web site that referred you to us and the next website you go to, the pages you request, the date and time of those requests and the country you are in. Except where you provide it to us via the website, we do not collect personal information such as your name, mailing address, email address or phone number when you are browsing our website. 

3.6 Ford does not generally require customers to disclose any sensitive information (e.g. details of race, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, health information etc.) to us. In limited circumstances, we may require prospective employees, individual contractors and Dealer personnel to provide us with certain health information. See **section 10** of this Privacy Policy for further details. 

3.7 If you do provide sensitive information to us for any reason (for example, if you provide us with information about a disability you have), you consent to us collecting that information and to us using and disclosing that information for the purpose for which you disclosed it to us and as permitted by the Privacy Act and other relevant laws. 

3.8 Occasionally, sensitive information in relation to an individual’s membership of a trade or similar association may be provided to us but we do not actively seek this information. We will only use and disclose that information for the purpose for which you disclosed it to us and as permitted by the Privacy Act and other relevant laws. 

3.9 In addition to the types of personal information identified above, Ford may collect personal information as otherwise permitted or required by law. 

### 4\. How do we collect your personal information?

7.3 Where we disclose your personal information to third parties we will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that such third parties only use your personal information as reasonably required for the purpose we disclosed it to them and in a manner consistent with the Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act, e.g. by (where commercially practical) including suitable privacy and confidentiality clauses in our agreement with a third party service provider to which we disclose your personal information. 

7.4 If you post information to certain public parts of our website or to our social media pages, you acknowledge that such information may be available to be viewed by the public. You should use discretion in deciding what information you upload to such sites.

### 8\. Does personal information leave Australia?

8.1 Some of the third parties to whom we disclose personal information may be located outside Australia. For example, we may disclose personal information to our related companies overseas and to our overseas service providers. 

8.2 The countries in which these third parties are located will depend on the circumstances. In the ordinary course of business we commonly disclose personal information to parties located in the United States, India, China and Singapore (where our Ford group data and business centres are located). Except where an exception applies under the Privacy Act, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such overseas recipients do not breach the Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act in relation to such information. 

### 9\. How do we protect personal information?

9.1 Ford will take reasonable steps to keep any personal information we hold about you secure. However, except to the extent liability cannot be excluded due to the operation of statute, we exclude all liability (including in negligence) for the consequences of any unauthorised access to, disclosure of, misuse of or loss or corruption of your personal information. Nothing in this Privacy Policy restricts, excludes or modifies or purports to restrict, exclude or modify any statutory consumer rights under any applicable law including the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). Please notify us immediately if you become aware of any breach of security. 

9.2 Your personal information will not be “sold” by Ford to any other organisation for that organisation's unrelated independent use. 

### 10\. What about information you provide in job applications?

10.1 If you submit a job application to Ford, we will use the information provided by you to assess your application. Ford may disclose the information contained in your application to contracted service providers for purposes such as screening, aptitude testing, medical testing and human resources management activities. 

10.2 As part of the application process or (if you are successful in being employed by Ford) after you commence employment with Ford, you may be required to complete a health questionnaire. You may also be asked to undergo a medical assessment. In that case, you will be asked to give specific consent for Ford to disclose your questionnaire to its service providers for the purposes of the medical assessment and for the relevant service providers to disclose the results of the assessment to Ford. 

10.3 If you refuse to provide any of the information requested by Ford, or to consent to Ford disclosing your questionnaire to its service providers for the purpose of a medical assessment or to the disclosure of the results of your medical assessment to Ford, we may be unable to consider your application (or if you have been successful in being employed by Ford, we may not be able to consider you for particular roles or positions within Ford). 

10.4 Ford will handle health information in accordance with applicable laws and our Health Information Policy. 

10.5 Ford may also ask you whether you agree to your personal information being provided to appropriate Ford suppliers so that you may be considered for positions with those suppliers which are relevant to your qualifications and experience. 

### 11\. Is the personal information we hold accurate?
