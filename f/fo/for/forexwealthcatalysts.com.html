        <p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all the people who use our Internet services (the Services). Those who visit our site and may access some our Services without having accounts with us (Visitors) as well as those who purchase Products and pay a fee to subscribe to our Services (Members). It also sets out what we do with the information we collect and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of this information. We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.</p></td>

We use this information mainly to provide a personalized experience as you use our Products and Services and generally do not share this information with third parties. <br>
                  <br>
      However, we may disclose personal information collected, if we have received your prior permission, or in very special circumstances as when we believe disclosure is required by law and in the special cases described below. </td>

    <td class="normal"><p><b>Upon Registration</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Products and Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information, (such as credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. Personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member’s account (such as for billing purposes.) This information is not shared with third parties, except as specifically stated or in special circumstances.<br>
                      <br>
        However in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner some personal information like the name, address and user name of the persons who subscribed who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion solely for the purpose of allowing us and the partner to asses the results of the promotion.<br>
                      <br>
        In this case, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate general non-identifying profiles from personal information our Members provide during registration, (like total number, but not the names of Members). As explained below, we would use this information to sell advertisements which may appear in the Services.

To provide Visitors and Members with some of these Products and Services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In such cases, you will be notified before any of your data is collected or transferred, giving you the choice of consent and allowing you to decide whether to use that particular feature or service.</p>

                  <br>
      In some cases, we use this general non-identifying profile information to deliver specific advertisements and for joint ventures. As an example, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the general non-identifying profile information we have collected, we may then display or send the information to the intended people. Our company does not share personal information of Visitors and Members with these advertisers or joint venture partners.

Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in customer surveys is voluntary. <br>
                  <br>
      We may take the information we receive from people responding to our surveys and combine it with the responses of other customers we have to prepare broader, general responses to the survey questions (such as age, gender, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry and other demographic information). We then use this information to improve the quality of the Services and Products we provide to you and to develop new products and services. This general non-identifying profile information may be shared with third parties.
