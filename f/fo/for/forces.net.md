You can exercise you rights by contacting us using the contact information provided in section 1 above. We have one month to respond to you. This period can be extended by a further two months where requests are complex or numerous. If this is the case, we will inform you within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why the extension is necessary.

a) Your right to be informed: this right is fulfilled through this privacy policy.

b) Your right of access: You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you.

c) Your right to rectification: You have the right to ask us to rectify any information we hold about you that you think is inaccurate or incomplete.

g) Your right to data portability: You have the right to ask us to transfer the information you gave us to another organisation, or to give it to you. The right only applies if we are processing information based on your consent or in talks about entering into a contract and the processing is automated.
