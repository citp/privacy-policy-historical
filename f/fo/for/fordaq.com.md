**How we protect your personal data**

Fordaq will take appropriate legal, organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data consistent with applicable privacy and data security laws. When Fordaq uses a third-party service provider, that provider will be carefully selected and required to use appropriate measures to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. 

**Sharing personal data**

We may transfer your personal data to various service providers. These service providers will usually provide IT services such as data hosting or services with regard to our websites’ functionalities. We require all such recipients to meet the same standards of data protection as our own. 

**When we may disclose your personal data to others**

If you are registered on Fordaq’s websites, Fordaq shall publish on its websites certain of the personal data you provided us during your registration. Other users, registered or not on the websites, shall be able to find these data through our websites. This is in line with the purpose of our websites, which primarily intends to help users find and to contact each other for business purposes. The following data shall be published on the websites : your name, contact details (phone number, email address, spoken languages, professional activity), the name of your company and other business information about your company (activities, products, number of employees, location, company number, date of membership with Fordaq, posted notices and advertisements, etc.). 

Furthermore, Fordaq reserves the right to disclose personal data about you, in accordance with law, for reporting to government authorities, to parties in relevant legal proceedings and otherwise to the extent required or explicitly authorized by applicable law. In certain special cases where permitted by law, we may disclose your personal data: 

  * when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to you or otherwise injuring or interfering with Fordaq's rights, property or operations, other users of this websites or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities
  * when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation
  * in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of a product line or division, a merger, consolidation, asset sale or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.



**Transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area**

Personal data collected may be transferred to recipients established outside the European Economic Area, in countries, which do not offer a level of protection for your personal data comparable to European Union law. 

This refers for example to Google, Facebook, Pingdom, Zopim (Zendesk), Mailchimp, Rackspace, Softlayer, Machinio, established in United-States of America. Sufficient guarantees in relation to these transfers however result from the fact that these recipients have formally adhered to the EU-US Privacy-Shield framework. 

Fordaq may also transfer personal data to a service provider called Yandex, which is established in Russia. Sufficient guarantees in that case result from standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data between Fordaq and Yandex . 

**Use of IP addresses**

An IP address is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your Internet service provider or through your organisation's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). Web servers automatically identify your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online. 

Fordaq, or third party companies acting on our behalf, may collect IP addresses for the purposes of systems administration and to audit the use of our websites. We also may use IP addresses to identify users of our websites when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the websites’ terms of use or to protect our service, websites or other users. 

**Cookies**

Our websites may use technology called "cookies." A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a server. Cookies allow our websites to respond to you as an individual. Websites can tailor their operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. For instance, our server may set a cookie that keeps you from having to enter a password more than once during a visit to a website. 

For additional information regarding our use of cookies, review our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/html/cookiePolicy.jspa). 

**Rights related to your personal data**

Provided all conditions provided by the GDPR are met, you may formulate the following requests in relation to the personal data we hold about you: 

  * having access to your personal data;
  * asking an update or correction of your personal data in the event of inaccuracies;
  * exercising your right to portability on your personal data;
  * asking erasure of your personal data;
  * asking restriction of the processing of your personal data



Furthermore, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data, including in case of automated individual decision-making or for direct marketing purposes. More specifically, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on the necessity for the conclusion of a contract or Fordaq’s legitimate interest, including profiling based on those grounds. Fordaq shall no longer process the personal data unless it demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. 

These rights may be exercised using the contact information provided at the end of this Privacy Statement. For emails Fordaq sends you for direct marketing purposes, you always have the possibility to unsubscribe by clicking on the link provided to that end in the e-mail. 

**Retention period**

We will retain your information only for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
