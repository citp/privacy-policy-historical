Foreign Policy, (“FP”, “we” or “us,”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our subscribers and visitors to the website [foreignpolicy.com](https://foreignpolicy.com/) (the “Site”). Visitors to the Site may view certain limited content without providing any personal information. Visitors who wish to view or subscribe to additional content may voluntarily register or subscribe as described on the Site and in this Privacy Policy.

**Contact Information**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, questions or complaints about the collection, use and processing of your personal information, please contact us by postal mail or email at:

Foreign Policy, 1750 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC, 20006

[privacy@foreignpolicy.com](mailto:privacy@foreignpolicy.com)

**What is Covered by this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy applies to users of this Site (“users”), which includes any person who accesses our Site. Users may be referred to in this Policy as “user,” “you” or “your.” The Terms of Use for the use of our Site are posted at <https://foreignpolicy.com/termsofuse>.  The Site is operated by Foreign Policy, a division of The Slate Group, LLC. This Privacy Policy applies to the use of personal information collected by us online, and offline if you subscribe offline, as described in this Policy.

**Purposes of Processing**

FP processes personal information to: (i) process your registration or subscription and enter into a contract, (ii) when you provide your explicit consent, (iii) for our legitimate business interests such securing and protecting the integrity of this Site, and for Site and product development; and as permitted to meet by applicable legal requirements.

**Registrations**

The minimum information we need to register you to our Site is name, email address, login ID, password, country, job title, and job industry. Registering for the Site and subscribing to our content are completely voluntary.  If you do not provide the required information, we may not be able to process your registration or subscription. During the registration process, you will have the ability of choosing to opt-in to receiving promotional emails, e-newsletters, and to access certain content on the Site.  At any point in time, you can choose to unsubscribe to these email communications by contacting us at the location in the Contact Information section.

**Subscriptions**

When you subscribe to FP online, we collect the same information required for registered users (items are listed in the Registration section of this Privacy Policy) and your postal address in order to deliver the requested items in our FP subscription and to manage your account. We also request information such as your job title and company in order for us to learn more about our customer base and to tailor our offerings.  During the subscription process, you choose the level of access you want to our Site and are given the ability to choose to opt-in to receiving e-newsletters. By choosing to purchase a subscription you are entering into a contract with us.

**How We Collect, and Use Your Personal Information**

Credit or debit card information and personal financial account information is considered “Sensitive Information.”  We do not directly collect credit card, debit card or personal financial account information when you subscribe to our content, because we use a third-party vendor, Braintree Payment Services, via a third-party fulfillment vendor to process our subscription billing. When you provide payment information to subscribe to our content you provide it directly to Braintree Payment Services and not to foreignpolicy.com.  Braintree Payment Services is a third-party vendor and has its own privacy policy, which may be different from ours. This Privacy Policy does not cover Braintree Payment Services and foreignpolicy.com is not covered by Braintree Payment Services privacy policy. To learn about Braintree Payment Services privacy practices, please read their privacy policy at <https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/braintree-privacy-policy>.

When you register for the Site or subscribe to our content, we collect your IP address for analytic purposes. If you have access to the Site through a business or employer account, we use your IP address to identify you with the account so you may access the Site.

We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to our Site through that site.

Our collection of your personal information is limited to the collection of necessary and adequate information required to accomplish the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

When you provide personal information, it is being provided directly by you to us, unless we receive it from publicly available sources such as a social media site.

If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or sale of our assets, your personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

**Marketing Communications**

You may receive marketing emails from us, only if you agree to do so.  Before sending any marketing communications we will make it clear to you during the registration or subscription process to check boxes or otherwise to “opt in” to receiving marketing emails and providing you the ability to change your preferences if you no longer want to receive them.  We also may email you occasionally with information or questions about your registration or your subscription account with reminders, warnings, or other types of requests.  We will collect and use individual user details if we have your permission or we have a legitimate interest for doing so, for example, collecting enough information to manage your subscription.

**How do we Protect Your Personal Information?**

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your information when you enter, submit, or access your information online. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect your personal information against accidental or intentional destruction or loss, and unauthorized disclosure or access.

Product, content, and subscription purchases made on foreignpolicy.com are directed through a secure transaction server to protect your personal and financial information.

**International Transfers of Personal Information**

Please be aware that the personal information we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location. If you are located outside of the United States, please be advised that we process and store personal data in the United States. Foreign Policy has executed standard contractual clauses to legitimize these data transfers.

**Data Storage and Retention**

Your personal information is stored on our servers and on the servers of database management service providers that we have engaged which are located in the United States.  We retain data for the duration of the relationship you have with us.

**Third Party Sites and Links**

Our Site may contain links to or features of other websites that are independent, are not owned or operated by us and which may incorporate Third Party Information. The collection of information by third party websites is not covered by this Privacy Policy and such third-party websites may have their own separate and independent privacy policies.  If you access other sites or features using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you, which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from ours.  We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of other websites, even if they are linked to our Site. In addition to collecting information directly from you, these third-party businesses may use tracking technology to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content, and track users who click on the links made available through the Site. When you use or interact with our Site, these third-party businesses may collect information about you, including your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties and we encourage you to read their privacy policies, which may apply to these third-party programs.

**Advertisement Choices**

Online advertising for our Site is delivered by multiple third-party vendors. For example, one of these types of vendors is Google’s DoubleClick. DoubleClick places cookies on your browser to facilitate serving particular ads.  For instance, to help determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, to tailor ads to you if you have visited our Site before, and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can opt out of these vendors use of cookies for these purposes by contacting them directly. To receive a list of the third party vendors that deliver online advertising to our Site, please contact [privacy@foreignpolicy.com](mailto:privacy@foreignpolicy.com).

In some cases, we and advertisers on our Site and other sites work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements tailored to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and audience segment providers, and they place cookies on your browser to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads on our Site and other sites that they believe you would find most relevant. You can opt out of those vendors’ use of cookies to tailor advertising to you by visiting <http://www.aboutads.info/>.

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and click stream data.

We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

Please be aware that any information that you submit to a social media site such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter is done at your own risk and without any expectation of privacy. Foreign Policy cannot control the actions of social media site users and is not responsible for any content or submissions contained on such sites. You should always review the privacy policy of any third-party site or application.

By using any functionality that permits submissions to social media sites, you are indicating that you have reviewed the applicable privacy policy and terms of use of that site. While we offer functionality through our Site that permits the posting of content on social media, please be aware that these sites may allow you to publicly post and share this content.

**Accuracy of personal information**

While we take various steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your personal information, we rely upon you to provide accurate and complete Information when interacting with us.

**Your Rights in Connection with Your Personal Information**

If you are in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, under certain circumstances, and as required by applicable law you have the right to:

  * **Request access** to your personal information. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
  * **Request correction** of any incomplete or inaccurate personal information that we hold about you.
  * **Request erasure** of your personal information when there is no need for us continuing to process it or you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
  * **Object to processing** of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
  * **Request the restriction of processing** of your personal information to suspend the processing, for example if you want us to verify its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
  * **Request the transfer** of your personal information to another party.



If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact the Data Protection Officer in writing per the ‘Where to turn with questions’ section of this Policy. Valid requests will be honored within 30 calendar days of request. This 30-day period may be extended for another 2 months for complex requests with notification of the reasons for the extension to you. Any such requests should be submitted using the information listed in the Contact Information section.

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances. In addition, there may be requests that we are unable to process because of other EU/EEA/Swiss legal requirements.  If a request is denied, we will notify you of the reason.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

If you are located in the EU, EEA or Switzerland you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU Supervisory Authority. However, if you have a complaint regarding the processing of your personal information we request that you first contact us and we will reply on timely basis.

If you have a rights request, please contact us using the information in the “Contact Information” section of this Privacy Policy.
