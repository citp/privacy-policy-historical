We follow industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

When your credit or debit card account information is being transmitted to our Sites or through our Sites, it will be protected by cryptographic protocols. To be clear, Finance Magnates LTD does not itself store your credit or debit card account information, and we do not have direct control over or responsibility for your credit or debit card account information.
