Last Updated: 29 November 2016 

### FORCEPOINT PRIVACY POLICY 

This Privacy Policy explains how Forcepoint and its affiliates ("Forcepoint", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, discloses and transfers the personal information you provide to us or we collect: 

  *  When you use http://www.forcepoint.com/ (and any of its sub-domains (the “Website”)); 
  *  When you do business with Forcepoint as outlined below; 
  *  When you use Forcepoint products; or 
  *  As otherwise described in this policy. 



This Privacy Policy also expresses our commitment to the Privacy Shield program as described below. 

This Privacy Policy was last updated at the date indicated above. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time so please check back regularly to keep informed of updates. 

Forcepoint has a separate privacy policy that governs how we collect, use and manage personally identifiable information regarding our employees. Forcepoint also applies Privacy Shield principles with respect to the personally identifiable information regarding our employees. A link to the privacy policy for employees can be found on the Forcepoint intranet home page. 

### 1\. PRIVACY SHIELD PARTICIPATION 

Forcepoint is pleased to participate in in the Privacy Shield program (<https://www.privacyshield.gov/>). Privacy Shield was established by the United States (US) government, in consultation with the European Commission and others, to provide a reliable means for transferring personal data from the European Union (EU) to the US while assuring data subjects continue to benefit from effective safeguards and protection as required by European legislation with respect to the processing of their personal data when they have been transferred to non-EU countries. 

We are committed to subjecting such EU Personal Data to the Framework to the extent that we have received it in reliance on the Framework, including its Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. To learn more about the Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's [Privacy Shield List here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/). In the event of a conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. 

Forcepoint has self–certified its commitment to subject all personal information received or collected from the EU to the Principles of the Privacy Shield program. Forcepoint’s Privacy Shield certification is reflected in the list of Privacy Shield program participant companies, which can be found by clicking on this link: Privacy Shield list. Forcepoint’s compliance to the Privacy Shield principles is subject to the enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission.
