**5 How we process and store your information**

5.1 For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is forward2me Limited.

5.2 The data that we collect from you is processed by staff who work either for us or one of our group companies or for one of our service providers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

5.3 All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain features or parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You must not share the password with anyone.

5.4 When you proceed to the Checkout, before you are prompted to complete your billing and delivery address, your browser will go into secure mode. Data relating to your order and your personal details will all pass to our server in an encrypted format. As soon as you have finished ordering you will exit secure mode. As an additional protection for you, our system is designed so that you cannot place an order until you are safely within secure mode.

We do not store any of your financial details such as credit card numbers. PayPal operates a secure server to process your payment details. PayPal encrypts your credit/debit card information and authorises payment.
