You may also provide information to the Website in other contexts, including, for example, to enter into a sweepstakes or promotion.

If you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit the Website, but you may be unable to access certain options and services.

### _Cookies_

A cookie is a small data file that is written to your computer's hard drive by your web browser.

Forbes uses cookies to track web analytics throughout the Website and membership status so that you don't have to login each time you visit the Website. The data read from these cookies may be linked to personally identifiable (PII) and non-personally identifiable (non-PII) information.

Business partners of Forbes, vendors providing hosting and other services for the Website and third party analytics providers may set their own unique cookies through your browser.

However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from the Website, you may not be able to use certain features of the site.

### _Web Beacons_

We use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our sites in order to recognize users, assess traffic patterns, identify preferred content and measure site engagement. We also include web beacons in our e-mail messages, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened.

The Website also uses a reputable third party to collect information, including through the use of web beacons, browser cookies and other tracking technologies. We may collect via web beacons various data provided by your browser while you are on our site and elsewhere where we may be acting as a 3rd party.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### _Sharing of Information_

When you are on an area of the Website and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Forbes as well as business partners and vendors providing hosting and other services for Forbes.

We use third parties to provide credit card processing, e-mail service providers and hosting services on our site. When you sign up for such services, we will share your personally identifiable information as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of your information by not using that particular service or the Website.

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you, such as your name and e-mail. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have the choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this personally identifiable information to notify contest winners and award prizes.

We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

### _In The Event of Sale or Bankruptcy_

The ownership of Forbes Magazine may change at some point in the future. Should that occur, we want this site to be able to maintain a relationship with you. In the event of a sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy or other change in control of Forbes Magazine LLC and/or Forbes Magazine your information may be shared with the person or business that owns or controls this site. Opting out of receiving information from third parties will not affect our right to transfer your information to a new owner, but your choices will continue to be respected regarding the use of your information. You will be notified as described below in "How will I know if the Privacy Policy is changed."

### _As Required By Law_

Forbes may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served on Forbes or to protect and defend the rights or property of Forbes.

### _Security_

Your information is stored on Forbes’ servers located in the United States. We use industry standard procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

### _Privacy of Children_

Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to us--including information such as your name, address, or e-mail address. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event that we learn we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.
