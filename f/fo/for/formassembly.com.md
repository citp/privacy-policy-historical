## What Information Do We Collect?

When you visit our Web site you may provide two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site. 

### 1\. Personal Information You Choose to Provide

When a User completes a form created, or purchased, by one of our Subscribers, the User may choose to provide the Subscriber with personal information, such as:

Name  
Mailing address  
E-mail address  
Social security number  
Health related information  
Home and business phone number  
Other personal information (i.e., mother's maiden name)  
E-mail Information  


We ask that Subscribers who create forms on our Site do not use the forms to collect credit card information. However, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MONITOR OR RESTRICT ALL OF THE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY OUR SUBSCRIBERS. FURTHER, DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT INFORMATION, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL INFORMATION THAT IS PROVIDED WILL REMAIN SECURE. See the section titled ‘How Can Your Information be Secured?’ below for further information.

In addition to providing the foregoing information to our Subscribers, if you choose to correspond further through e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone. 

### 2\. Web Site Use Information

Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual. 

## How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?

Broadly speaking, we may use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities and for providing Subscriber service. We are a Web site host and our primary function as it relates to User data is to facilitate use of the forms and to store such User inputted data for use by the Subscriber for their business purposes. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities, such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. WE DO NOT SELL OR SHARE ANY COLLECTED INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY OTHER THAN THE SUBSCRIBER TO WHOM YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW THE SUBSCRIBER USES THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY USERS. 

We do not spam email and we do not permit our Subscribers to spam to the extent we can reasonably prevent such efforts. Our [Terms of Service](http://www3.formassembly.com/terms-of-service.php) prohibit all Subscribers from engaging in spam activity. Violations of this policy may result in immediate termination of service and legal action. 

### Choice/Opt-Out

We enable you to create an account, and share information such as messages, offers, & requests with others. 

**Newsletters & Promotional Emails**  
As part of our service, you have the option to receive our newsletter. Out of respect for your privacy, if you wish to no longer receive our newsletters you may follow the instructions in the email and/or make the appropriate setting changes directly in your account. 

**Service-related Announcements**  
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. If you wish to no longer receive our newsletters you may follow the instructions in the email and/or make the appropriate setting changes directly in your account. 

**Surveys or Contests**  
From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). 

We use this information to gather feedback on new or improved features, determine what improvements should be made to the application, and improve personalization of the application. In the case of a contest, information is used to notify winners and award prizes. 

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. They are small pieces of data that are stored by a User's Web browser on the User's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a User accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same User or to use the information to streamline the User's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a User to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized. 

### Tracking Technologies and Third Party Cookies

We use Google Analytics, a third-party tracking service, which uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about our visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics. Some of our business partners (e.g., Google Analytics) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Veer West LLC only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party. 

## How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?

We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Web site Users' browsing activities in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve Users. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most User-friendly manner and to continually improve our Web site to better meet the needs of Users and Subscribers. 

Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by Users to our Web site as they move from one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site's visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture your individual e-mail address or any personally identifying information about you. 

## How Can Your Information be Secured?

We provide the capability for your data to be encrypted. However, the creator of the form in which you input data chooses how and whether to encrypt your information. Before inputting any sensitive information, determine if encryption is enabled by looking for the "lock" symbol on your web browser or a yellow highlight in the web browser address bar. 

INFORMATION OR E-MAIL THAT YOU SEND TO US MAY NOT BE SECURE UNLESS WE ADVISE YOU THAT SECURITY MEASURES WILL BE IN PLACE PRIOR TO YOUR TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION. For that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as a social security number to us through an unsecured e-mail. 

## Information Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at contact@formassembly.com. We do not, however, secure your personal information that is in the possession or control of our Subscriber. 

## How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may request access to all your personally identifiable information to correct, update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it by making the change by logging into your account, by emailing us at contact@formassembly.com, or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. 

## What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?

We may disclose your personal information:

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process,
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,
  * if Veer West LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.



## What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site? 

Integration with 3rd party services (Google Apps, Salesforce and more) requires exchange of information, such as credentials (username, password, open ID/single-sign-on tokens) and any other data required for implementation of said integration. Integration is optional, and subscribers must explicitly authorize such transaction. Any data received from 3rd party service is covered by this privacy policy. 

We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site (such as our blog) nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the Users of our Web site. 

Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have a link to our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. 

Although not owned, controlled, or moderated by our site, we do offer a link to our publicly accessible customer feedback tool. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. 

## Your Consent

By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our Web site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Your continued or subsequent use of our services after any such change shall constitute your consent to such change. 

With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at contact@formassembly.com. 

## Notification of Privacy Statement Changes

We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
