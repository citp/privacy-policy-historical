If you have previously given your consent to us using your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may withdraw your consent at any time by writing to us or emailing us at [privacy@forgerock.com](mailto:privacy@forgerock.com)**

Some of our events are sponsored or hosted by our external partners.  If you register to attend such an event, we may share the Contact Information you provided in connection with registration with our event partner for purposes of verifying registration and ensuring only registered guests are allowed access. 

Although the event registration page has the same look and feel as [www.forgerock.com](http://www.forgerock.com/) you may actually be submitting registration information to a third-party service provider that then returns the information to our website in order to fulfil your registration request.  

**Please note that  we will only share your Contact Information directly with our event partner if you registered for the event. If you do not wish to have your information included in an attendee list or do not wish to receive information from our event partners, you can so advise us when you register for our events or you may contact us directly at [privacy@forgerock.com](mailto:info@forgerock.com). **

#### e) When you attend one of our live events, web conferences, or seminars:

If you register for one of our events and you have a ForgeRock account, we will access the Personal Information in your ForgeRock account in order to provide you with information and services associated with the event. If you do not have a ForgeRock account, we will collect your Contact information upon registration, which we will use to provide you with information and services associated with the event.

When you register for University offerings through one of our third-party training partners, you will be notified that you are leaving our website, whereupon your activities will be subject to that third party’s privacy policies and this Statement will no longer apply . While we endeavour to work with partners who share our commitment to protecting your privacy, we encourage you to confirm that you are comfortable with that party’s policies before sharing any Personal Information on their website. 

#### g) When you pursue certification through ForgeRock University:

When you register for one of our certification exams, we collect your Contact Information, which we share with our third-party, computer-based-exam service provider. That service provider will, in turn, share with us the Contact Information you furnish to them to verify your identity for the exam. We will also collect your exam results in order to update and maintain our certification records.  

**Only authorized  ForgeRock employees have access to our certification records and individual exam results. **

In addition, you can object to the processing of your Personal Information in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the information to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the information for direct marketing). These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal Personal Information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping (such as fraud prevention purposes).  

To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us using the details set out at the end of this Policy. Additionally, our websites allow you to edit your Personal Information and your communication preferences by accessing your [ForgeRock Preference Center](https://go.forgerock.com/Preference-Center_Submit-Your-Email.html).

To register with ForgeRock, to create an account with us, and to use some ForgeRock websites, products or services, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer a ForgeRock account to you, or provide you with the websites, products or services requested.  All other provision of your information is optional. Providing optional information will help us offer you a better experience, such as more personalized or tailored content or offerings.

#### Withdrawing Consent or Otherwise Objecting to Direct Marketing

ForgeRock and the third-party marketing services providers we hire to help us market our products and services on our behalf may use your Personal Information to provide you with information and offers related to ForgeRock.  Wherever we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your information for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time by: updating your preferences by accessing your [ForgeRock Preference Center](https://go.forgerock.com/Preference-Center_Submit-Your-Email.html) or contacting us using the details provided at the end of this policy.

This information is used to help improve the website, analyse trends, administer the website and provide optimised advertising to you. 

#### Our Cookies

Cookies and ad technology such as web beacons, pixels, and anonymous ad network tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively.  A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit that site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font-size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you do not have to keep re-entering them whenever you return to the site.  Pixels help us understand and improve the delivery of ads to you 

Our website uses cookies to improve user experience. By using our website, you Consent to all cookies in accordance with our Cookie Policy if you chose not to opt out. Our cookies are not used to identify your Personal Information. They use pattern data to identify trends, hence they are not used for any other purpose except those described here. 

  * **Strictly Necessary Cookies** :  Some of our cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you, which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any of your Personal Information and are only used to deliver essential functionality to the website. 
  * **Performance Cookies** :  These cookies allow us to count website visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our website.

We provide those companies with only the necessary amount of Personal Information they need to deliver our service and only where there is a legitimate reason to do so. Where this reason involves your consent, we will ensure that we obtain it and do not share Personal Information where we do not have permission to do so.  

We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with other organizations. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it will not include Personal Information. 

All of our partners, suppliers and contractors are legally obliged to maintain your Personal Information confidentiality at all times and that they are not to use your Personal Information in any way other than to provide you with ForgeRock products and services that you have consented to be provided unless there is another legitimate legal purpose to do so.

In some circumstances, we may provide targeted lists of names as well as offline and online Contact Information for marketing purposes to a third-party agent acting on our behalf.  Should this be the case, the third party will be subject to ForgeRock policies and will have a clear contracted purpose.  You have the right not to allow us to share your Personal Information with these third parties and can explicitly opt out of this when registering your preferences.

ForgeRock may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on ForgeRock; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ForgeRock or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of ForgeRock employees or agents, users of ForgeRock products or services, or members of the public.  We will disclose Personal Information in response to a court order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this Personal Information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property. You should also be aware that courts of equity, such as Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit Personal Information to be shared or transferred to third parties without permission.

From time to time we may invite you to provide information via surveys or customer feedback forms.

ForgeRock relies on derogations for specific situations as set forth in  **Article 49 of the GDPR**  as the basis for such transfers. ForgeRock collects and transfers to the U.S. Personal Information only with your consent or to perform a contract with you or to full-fill a compelling legitimate interest of ForgeRock in a manner that does not outweigh your privacy rights.  

Where transfers of Personal Information are made, the appropriate legal mechanisms are in place to ensure that Personal Information is treated appropriately and in line with legal requirements for compliance.
