# Privacy Policy | ForgeRock

**Privacy Policy**

Updated: Oct. 1, 2012

ForgeRock is committed to protecting your privacy. By accessing the site, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement.

 **Collecting Your Personal Information**

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a transaction that you have requested such as requesting information about ForgeRock, ordering e-mail newsletters, joining ForgeRock, signing up for an event or training. The personal information we collect may include your name, title, company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address, information about your job function, and information about your company. When you register for an online event or resource on our site you are asked for your name, email address, country, and job title. Although the event registration page has the same look and feel as [www.forgerock.com](http://www.forgerock.com/) you may actually be submitting registration information to our third party service provider who then shares the information back with [www.forgerock.com](http://www.forgerock.com/) in order to fulfill your registration request. Please note that our privacy statement does apply and that our service provider must treat your personal information in accordance with our privacy statement. Your security is important to our third party service provider. The Site may collect certain anonymous information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site. This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site.

 **Links**

The personal information collected through our offline forms will be used to operate the site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. In support of these uses, ForgeRock may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the site and any related ForgeRock products or services. We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. ForgeRock occasionally hires other companies, consultants and contractors to provide limited services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, public relations, mailing, answering customer questions about products and services, and sending information about our products, special offers and other new services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. ForgeRock may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on ForgeRock or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ForgeRock or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of ForgeRock employees or agents, users of ForgeRock products or services, or members of the public. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at info@forgerock.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
