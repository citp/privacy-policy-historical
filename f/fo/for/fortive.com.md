Notice or, if longer, as required by applicable law or regulation. We have internal rules that set out how long
we retain information. What this means in practice will vary as between different types of information, and
when we consider our approach we take into account any ongoing need for the information as well as our
                                                                                                              Page 2

legal obligations, for example in relation to tax, health and safety, and potential or actual disputes or
investigations.
Who do we share your personal data with?
From time to time your personal data may be shared with third parties such our professional advisers,
service providers, group companies, and corporate transactional (mergers and acquisitions) partners and
advisors for the following purposes.
•    Professional advisers: including accountancy and legal firms where they require that information in
     order to provide Fortive with advice;
•    Service providers: including those organisations who provide and support our data management and
     storage systems;
•    Group companies: Fortive is a member of a global organisation, and data may be shared internally
     within the group, primarily for business and operational purposes.
•    Merger partners: it may be that Fortive or any of its affiliates merges or is acquired by a separate
     organisation, in which case it will become necessary to share personal data with them.
All of these third parties are bound to comply with similar and equally stringent undertakings of privacy and
confidentiality.
Where required we share your personal information with third parties to comply with a legal obligation;
when we believe in good faith that an applicable law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities
conducting an investigation; to detect and protect against fraud, or any technical or security vulnerabilities;
to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties,
visitors to our websites, our businesses, or the public.
No other third parties have access to your information unless we specifically say so in this Privacy Notice, or
the law requires this.
What legal basis do we have for using your personal data?
We process your information:
•    to be able to provide you with products and services in line with our Terms & Conditions and the other
     information provided via Fortive websites.
•    as this is necessary for the performance of the contract with you or to take steps at your request prior
     to entering into this contract.
•    to comply with our legal obligations.
•    to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of others.
•    as this is necessary in pursuit of our legitimate interests in operating a global business, and this includes
     profiling related to your personal data. While there are some risks inherent in any processing of
     personal data, we have considered the risk to your data protection rights and on balance determined it
     is outweighed by the significant benefits in providing Fortive’s goods and services to a relevant and
     interested marketplace. We’ve also implemented processes and controls to protect your rights. You
     have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of

We store your personal data safely at our premises, in contracted storage facilities, with our service

We strive to process your information within the country where we collected it or within the EEA. If we or
our service providers transfer personal data, where relevant, outside of the EEA, we will always require that
appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the information that is transferred. For example, a portion of

accessed from the USA. You can obtain a copy of the safeguards in place for such transfers by contacting us
using the details at the end of this Privacy Notice.
How do we keep your personal data secure?
We ensure the security of your personal data by implementing a specific set of technical and organisational
security measures that are based on controls published by the Center for Internet Security. These controls
call for the use of encryption, firewalls, and other measures that ensure we provide a level of security
appropriate to the risk presented by a particular situation.
What rights do you have in relation to the personal data we hold on you?
By law, you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data. We describe them below.
Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in
your country.
Rights                                         What does this mean?
 1. The right to be informed                  You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and
                                              easily understandable information about how we use your
                                              information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with
                                              the information in this Privacy Notice.
 2. The right of access                       You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we’re
                                              processing it), and certain other information (similar to that
                                              provided in this Privacy Notice).
                                              This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your
                                              information in accordance with data protection law.
 3. The right to rectification                You are entitled to have your information corrected if it’s
                                              inaccurate or incomplete.
 4. The right to erasure                      This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple
                                              terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your
                                              information where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep
                                              using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are
                                              exceptions.
 5. The right to restrict processing          You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your
                                              information. When processing is restricted, we can still store
                                              your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of
                                              people who have asked for further use of their information to be
                                              ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.
                                                                                                                Page 5

Rights                                       What does this mean?
 6. The right to data portability           You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your
                                            own purposes across different services. For example, if you
                                            decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move,
                                            copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems
                                            and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability.
 7. The right to object to processing       You have the right to object to certain types of processing,
                                            including processing based on our legitimate interests and
                                            processing for direct marketing (i.e. if you no longer want to be
                                            contacted with potential opportunities).
 8. The right to lodge a complaint          You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle
                                            or process your personal data with your national data protection
                                            regulator.
 9. The right to withdraw consent           If you have given your consent to anything we do with your
                                            personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
                                            any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything
                                            we have done with your personal data with your consent up to
                                            that point is unlawful). This includes your right to withdraw
                                            consent to us using your personal data for marketing purposes.
How can you make a request to exercise your rights?

this Privacy Notice.
How will we handle a request to exercise your rights?

expect your request is going to take us longer to fulfil, we’ll come back to you within that first month and let
you know.
We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but we may charge a reasonable fee to
