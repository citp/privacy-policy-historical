# FormSite - html form builder

Your privacy is of the utmost importance to FormSite.com. FormSite.com attempts to minimize personal information members need to reveal. However, we do ask for some basic personal information when creating forms at FormSite.com. This information provides aggregate demographic data that FormSite.com uses to better understand the types of people using FormSite.com. This data also allows us to do a better job of recommending content that may be of interest to you on FormSite.com, and to show you advertisements that are relevant to your age and geographic location. Ultimately, however, the decision to provide this information is yours. Information that FormSite.com requests, but does not require, includes Home Zip Code, Birth Year, and Gender.

FormSite.com may send you email messages on a regular basis to keep you apprised of your membership status and inform you of new services available to you. Included in each of these messages are simple instructions on how to remove yourself from these mailings if you do not wish to receive them in the future. 

You can elect to terminate your membership with FormSite.com at any time, by sending email to support@FormSite.com. Be sure to include your Username in the body of your message, so that we can easily identify your account. Upon termination, your account information will not necessarily be removed entirely from FormSite.com - this is to reserve your identity so that no one else can create a new account with your Username or Email Address, and also allows you the privilege of reactivating your account at a later date if you wish to use FormSite.com again. .

We strive to protect your data from unauthorized access. All security measures at the site are derived from the idea that the person who creates a form and solicits data for that form is the ultimate owner of the data. We will never give out  
any data collected from your form without your permission. Furthermore, we will not give out your name or any identifying information about specific users to any third party. Nor will we use any email address you provide for any third-party  
solicitations without your permission. Subject to court order, we will release any information as required by law. 

The systems containing the FormSite.com data are password protected and well administered. The data within the database is not encrypted however. If our server is in some way compromised, the data may be revealed. Such an event is extremely unlikely.
