<br>
If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free to 
contact us by e-mail at privacy@forbes.net. <br>
<br>
<b>Summary</b> <br>
Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on 
our website. We use aggregated (gathered up data across all user accounts) 
information to develop content targeted to users' interests and to better the 
website user experience. ForbesTraveler.com is committed to your privacy and 
other than as provided herein or after receiving your specific consent, 
ForbesTraveler.com will not share any personal information with any third party 
at any time, unless required by law. <br>
<br>
What this Privacy Policy Covers <br>
This privacy policy covers the website ForbesTraveler.com. Other Forbes.com LLC. 
sites linked to from this website, including Forbes.com, have their own privacy 
statements which can be viewed on those sites. <br>
<br>
Please be aware that ForbesTraveler.com sponsors, advertisers, co-branded 
websites or websites that have links on our site may collect personally 
identifiable information about you on their websites. The information practices 
of those parties are not covered by this privacy statement. ForbesTraveler.com 
users should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal 
information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected 
by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others. <br>
<br>
<b>Gathering of Information</b> <br>
<br>
<b>Voluntary Submission</b> <br>
ForbesTraveler.com does not collect personally identifying information about any 
individual ForbesTraveler.com website user except when knowingly provided by 
such individual. For example, we may ask you for information, such as your email 
address, ZIP code and the country in which you are viewing the website when you 
register to become a member of ForbesTraveler.com. You may also provide 
information to ForbesTraveler.com in other contexts, for example, to enter a 
contest or complete a survey. In the event you order something from 
ForbesTraveler.com or one of our sponsors, we may request additional personal 
information, such as your address, telephone number and credit card information, 
in order to complete the purchase. You always have the option not to provide the 
information we request. If you choose not to provide the information we request, 
you can still visit most of the ForbesTraveler.com website, but you may be 
unable to access certain options and services. When you register or become a 
member of Forbes.com or provide information to Forbes.com in any other manner, 
you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information. <br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b> <br>
A cookie is a data file that certain websites write to your computer's hard 
drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can contain information, such as 
a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have 
visited. ForbesTraveler.com uses cookies to track user traffic patterns 
throughout the ForbesTraveler.com website and to remember your passwords and 
video plug-in preferences so that you don't have to reset them each time you 
visit the website. We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not 
correlate this information with personal data of any user. Business partners of 
ForbesTraveler.com and vendors providing hosting and other services for 
ForbesTraveler.com., as well as advertisers who contract directly with a 
third-party service to serve their advertisements, may set their own cookies 
which may collect similar anonymous information. <br>
<br>
Most website browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change 
your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to 
refuse all cookies. However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies 
from our website, you may not be able to use certain features of the site. <br>
<br>
<b>Browser Level Information <br>
</b>ForbesTraveler.com web servers automatically collect information about a 
site user's IP address, browser type and the URL that you just came from 
(whether this URL is on the website or not) and which URL you next go to 
(whether this URL is on the website or not) by reading this information from the 
user's browser (information provided by every user's browser). This information 
is collected in a database and used--in an aggregated, anonymous manner--in our 
internal analysis of traffic patterns within our website. This information is 
automatically logged by most websites. ForbesTraveler.com also uses a third 
party to collect information, including through the use of web beacons. <br>

<b>Use of Information <br>

<br>
<b>To Target Content <br>

how well each page or content area performs overall. <br>
&nbsp;<p></p>
<p><b>To Provide Interactive Communications From ForbesTraveler.com</b><br>
To enhance your experience we may provide you with interactive communications,

or contests on the website to those users who have expressly provided us with 
their permission to send such communications as part of their user profile. </p>
<p><br>
<b>To Provide Communications From Third Parties</b><br>
We respect the privacy of our users and shall not disclose or distribute our 
user list to any third party, nor shall it permit anyone else to do so. However, 
we do make available for rental our list of those registrants who have expressly 
provided us with their permission to receive third party information and offers 
as part of their user profile. In those cases, your personal information is not 
transferred to the third party.<br>
Control of Your Information</p>

<br>
<b>Sharing of Information <br>

b) to a third party shipping service or common carrier as necessary to deliver 
your order to you.<br>
<br>
<b>Aggregate, Anonymous Information With Advertisers</b> <br>
ForbesTraveler.com derives the majority of its revenue from advertising and 
sharing information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users. In 
order to attract and retain advertisers we use the aggregated, anonymous 
information that we gather (as well as information from third-party market 
researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers 
and sponsors to better understand our audience. We do not disclose personally 
identifying information about our users to these parties. <br>
<br>
<b>As Necessary to Provide Services to You <br>
</b>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our 
behalf, such as performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only 
provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the 
service. These companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain 
the confidentiality of your information and they are prohibited from using that 
information for any other purpose. <br>
<br>
<b>In The Event of Sale or Bankruptcy<br>
</b>The ownership of ForbesTraveler.com may change at some point in the future. 
Should that occur, we want this site to be able to maintain a relationship with 
you. In the event of a sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy or other change 
in control of Forbes.com LLC and/or ForbesTraveler.com your information may be 
shared with the person or business that owns or controls this site. Opting out 
of receiving information from third parties will not affect our right to 
transfer your information to a new owner, but your choices will continue to be 
respected regarding the use of your information. <br>
As Required By Law <br>
ForbesTraveler.com may disclose your personal information if required to do so 
by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to 
the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on ForbesTraveler.com 
or to protect and defend the rights or property of ForbesTraveler.com. <br>

States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal 
information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure 
to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket 
Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and 
unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect 
such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. 
However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. <br>
<br>
<b>Privacy of Children <br>
</b>Kids under 13: Do not send any information about yourself to us--including 
information such as your name, address, or email address. We do not knowingly 
collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the event
