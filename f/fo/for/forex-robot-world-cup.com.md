The views and opinions provided by The International EA Competition are not endorsed nor controlled by our preferred Forex brokers. Further, Forex brokers are not responsible for their availability, content, or delivery of services and will not accept liability for any loss or damage, including without limitation to, any loss of profit, which may arise directly or indirectly from use of or reliance on such information. 

Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.

At all times you must note that you shall not and cannot assume, nor do we provide, any assurance that any prior successes, or past results, as to income earnings, can be used as an indication of your future success or results. By relying on or using any of our products, services or written materials or information, you acknowledge unequivocally, that we make no claim, nor do we make any guarantee or warrantee or representation of any kind, in terms of the correctness, accuracy, reliability, currency or otherwise thereof. The entire risk as to the results and outcome and performance of the products and services and use of any information or product or material provided by ourselves, are assumed by you.
