How we use and with whom we share the personal information we gather

Overview<br>
Privacy is of great concern to most users of the Internet, and is a critical part of an enjoyable and satisfactory user experience. We at Forex Directory are acutely aware of and sensitive to the privacy concerns of our subscribers and other visitors to our Website. Whether you are a customer of our various products and services or a visitor to our site, we assure you that we do not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. You should be assured that we do not provide or sell personal information about our customers or site visitors to vendors that are not involved or affiliated with ForexDirectory’s products or services.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">
This Privacy Statement applies to the ForexDirectory Website. Many of our subsidiaries maintain their own privacy policies that may be viewed on their Websites. ForexDirectory has a “network” of Affiliates that offer our services. We strive to provide our visitors and subscribers with the highest level of privacy possible, and therefore require that our Affiliates offer no less protection than that offered in this Privacy Statement. In addition, each of our Affiliates must meet the data protection requirements of their relevant national laws. Please note that our Website contains links to other Websites. ForexDirectory is not responsible for the privacy practices, privacy statements, or content regarding these other Websites.

Privacy Policy Enforcement<br>
If you feel that we are violating this Privacy Statement, please contact us at enquiry@forexdirectory.net. Please specify “Privacy Statement” in the subject line of your e-mail. We will respond as promptly as possible.

</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">
Statistical Information About Your Visit<br>
When you visit our Website, our computers may automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information does not identify you personally, but rather identifies information about a visit to our Website. We may monitor statistics such as how many people visit our Website, the user’s IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come and which browsers people use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregation purposes only. These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our Website.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">
Use of Cookies<br>
We only use “cookies” as described in this Section. A “cookie” is a piece of information that our Web site sends to your browser, which then stores this information on your system. If a cookie is used, our Website will be able to “remember” information about you and your preferences either until you exit your current browser window (if the cookie is temporary) or until you disable or delete the cookie. Many users prefer to use cookies in order to help them navigate a Web site as seamlessly as possible. You should be aware that cookies contain no more information than you volunteer, and they are not able to “invade” your hard drive and return to the sender personal or other information from your computer.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">
Our uses of “cookies” are limited to the following specific situation. That situation is with respect to temporary cookies. There are two instances in which we use temporary cookies. First, if you are accessing our services through one of our online applications our Web server may automatically send your browser a temporary cookie, which is used to help your browser navigate our Website. The only information contained in these temporary cookies is a direction value that lets our software determine which page to show when you hit the back button in your browser. This bit of information is erased when you close your current browser window. If you come to our Website from one of our business partners, our Web server may also send your browser a temporary cookie that reflects an “origination code” for that business partner. We use this information for statistical and marketing purposes.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="3">
Bulletin Boards, Chat Rooms and Forums<br>
If you use a forum, bulletin board, chat room or other chat tool on this Website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. ForexDirectory is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. You are also responsible for using these forums in a manner consistent with the Rules of Engagement or other terms and conditions set forth on the relevant forum site.

Please be assured that we have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any personal information we receive from you.

In order to try to minimize this risk, we encrypt all information that you submit in ordering one of our products or services using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
