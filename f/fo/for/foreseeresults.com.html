      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>ForeSee Results is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online
  visitors by maintaining the highest standards of confidentiality and security
  for all data collected from survey participants as well as visitors to our publicly
  available website. This privacy notice describes how we collect information
  and how it is used.
      </p><h3>Information Collection</h3>
      <p>ForeSee provides online website customer satisfaction surveys on behalf of its customers. In addition to the information we collect through our online survey, ForeSee may collect additional personal information, which is shared with the customer for whom ForeSee provides the survey. Such information may include the survey participant’s name, age, address, telephone number, and email address. Participation in our surveys is always optional.</p>
      <h3>Use of Information</h3>
      <p>ForeSee uses the information collected from the online surveys to compile reports on website customer satisfaction for our customers. Due to the sensitive nature of research data, any information that is collected is treated with the utmost confidentiality. ForeSee will not sell any personal information gathered from individual respondents. Furthermore, personal data is never shared with any third parties unless the customer has specifically authorized such. All company-specific
information gathered through our online survey tool will be the property of the
customer. Our customers are encouraged to participate in privacy initiatives
to protect the privacy and security of the data collected. However, since we
do not have direct control over the policies or practices of our customers, we
cannot be responsible for their actions. We recommend that you always review
the privacy policies of the website for which you have been presented a survey
before you provide any personal information. </p>
      <p>Visitors to the ForeSee website may be asked to provide personal contact information in exchange for access to white papers as well as other downloadable content on our site. ForeSee may use this information for sales and marketing purposes. This information will never be shared with any third party.</p>
      <h3>Aggregated Research Data</h3>
      <p>ForeSee compiles data collected from its online surveys to produce benchmark reports for its customers as well as media and other interested parties. Such information is based on aggregated, anonymous information and does not include any personally identifiable information about individuals.</p>
      <h3>Disclosures Required by Law</h3>
      <p>ForeSee may disclose personal information in response to a judicial or other government subpoena, warrant or order.</p>
      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>Many web sites use "cookies" to help personalize a respondent’s online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on the hard drive of a computer by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the services or web sites you visit.</p>
      <p>ForeSee Results survey mechanism places a session level cookie on respondents’ browser to track how many pages a particular visitor has passed over. Session level cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session. We use this technique to ensure that a visitor has sufficiently browsed the site in order to adequately answer the survey and to prevent an individual from getting a survey multiple times in a single session. Persistent cookies are automatically deleted on a set expiration date. We will only place a persistent cookie if the company employing ForeSee Results allows for this type of cookie to be utilized. This persistent cookie will only be used to track that a particular respondent has seen the survey and has completed or denied the survey so as not to be bothered with it again within a reasonable amount of time. In no way will ForeSee Results collect any personal information with this persistent cookie. Nor will we track any visitor once they have left the given site.</p>
      <h3>Children and Parents</h3>
      <p>ForeSee’s surveys and website are not designed or intended for use by children under 13, although the sites we survey may offer children’s products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you should not participate in our survey or use our site unless a parent or guardian is present. Children under 13 may not submit any personally identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information for a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it. Children over 13 should only provide us with personally identifiable information if they have explicit permission from a parent or legal guardian. If your child has submitted personal information, and you wish to review, change and/or delete such information as well as refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information, please contact us at the address provided below. ForeSee Results is proud to stand by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>While no system is completely foolproof, ForeSee takes the security of the data collected very seriously. We use secure server hosting locations with 24x7 security and monitoring, firewall protection, controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data.</p>
