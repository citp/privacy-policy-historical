<p><strong>3    Information we may collect from you</strong></p>
<p>3.1    We may collect and process the following data about you: <br>3.1.1 details of transactions you carry out through our website www.forward2me.com (the Site) and of the fulfilment of your orders;<br>3.1.2 information that you provide by filling in forms on the Site, including,  but not limited to, information provided at the time of requesting or  subscribing to any service, or becoming a registered user or if you  enter any competition or promotion sponsored by us;<br>3.1.3 information from surveys that we use for research purposes, if you choose to respond to them;<br>3.1.4 communications you send to us, for example to report a problem with or submit a comment regarding the Site; <br>3.1.5 and details of your visits to the Site, including, but not limited to,  traffic data, location data and the resources that you access.</p>
<p><strong>4    IP addresses and cookies</strong></p>
<p>4.1    We may collect information about your computer including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
<p>4.2    For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.    They help us to improve the Site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us to: <br>4.2.1 estimate our audience size and usage pattern;<br>4.2.2 store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise the Site according to your individual interests;<br>4.2.3 speed up your searches;<br>4.2.4 and recognise you when you return to the Site.</p>

However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you use the Site.

<p><strong>5    How we process and store your information</strong></p>
<p>5.1    For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is forward2me Limited.</p>
<p>5.2    The data that we collect from you is processed by staff who work either for us or one of our group companies or for one of our service providers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.</p>
<p>5.3 All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain features or parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You must not share the password with anyone.</p>
<p>5.4 When you proceed to the Checkout, before you are prompted to complete your billing and delivery address, your browser will go into secure mode. Data relating to your order and your personal details will all pass to our server in an encrypted format. As soon as you have finished ordering you will exit secure mode. As an additional protection for you, our system is designed so that you cannot place an order until you are safely within secure mode.</p>
<p>5.5    All payment transactions will be processed on our behalf by PayPal. This means that your credit/debit card details are provided directly to PayPal and are never revealed to us. We do not store any of your financial details such as credit card numbers. PayPal operates a secure server to process your payment details. PayPal encrypts your credit/debit card information and authorises payment.</p>
<p>5.6    We recommend that you do not communicate your payment card details to anyone, including us, by email. We cannot be responsible for any losses you may incur in transmitting information to us by internet link or by email. Any such loss shall be entirely your responsibility.</p>
<p>5.7    Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. Remember to close your browser when you have finished your user session. This will help to ensure that others do not access your personal information if you share your computer or use a computer in a public places such as a library or internet café.</p>
<p>5.8    If you have any queries about security, please email us at:
