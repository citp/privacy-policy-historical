# Privacy Policy | Forensiq

Updated October 12, 2017

Forensiq LLC (“Forensiq”) is an industry leader in online fraud detection. Our technology platform provides measurements about ad impression delivery to help advertisers and advertising inventory sellers confirm accurate delivery characteristics, including viewability metrics and ad impression fraud characteristics. Additionally, advertisers use information we provide about ad impression opportunities to preemptively decide if they want their creative displayed in the available impression environment. With this advanced technology and our dedicated team of data scientists we help you eliminate impression fraud, click fraud, affiliate fraud and cookie stuffing.
