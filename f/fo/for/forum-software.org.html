By using the Forum Software Reviews Website, you signify your consent to this Privacy Policy and the <a href="/terms-conditions">Terms and Conditions of Use</a> posted on the Forum Software Reviews Website. This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Forum Software Reviews Website.
</p>
<h3>1. Managing Your Information Preferences.</h3>
<p>You may review, correct, update, or change your Personal Information, or remove your Personal Information from our direct marketing efforts, at any time by changing the relevant setting in your Forum Software Reviews <a href="/user">profile</a> or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@forum-software.org">webmaster@forum-software.org</a>. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us the same way.</p>
<h3>2. Information We Collect.</h3>
<p>(a) Personal Information. We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your name, username, email address, credit card details, and such other information as we may from time to time request ("Personal Information") only if you choose to share such information with us. For example, you may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information when you register with the Forum Software Reviews Website. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content, features, or services available on or through the Forum Software Reviews Website.</p>
<p>(b) Non-Personal Information. We automatically collect anonymous usage information that does not identify an individual user ("Non-Personal Information") to help us understand how users use the Forum Software Reviews Website.

<p>(c) Cookies and Web Beacons. We use cookies (a small file containing a string of characters that uniquely identifies your Web browser) and Web beacons (an electronic file placed within a Web site that monitors usage). We use cookies and Web beacons to improve the quality of the Forum Software Reviews Website. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, certain features of the Forum Software Reviews Website may not work if you delete or disable cookies.</p>
<h3>3. How We Use Personal And Non-Personal Information We Collect.</h3>

<p>(b) Service Providers. From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as credit card processing, advertising, analytics tools, widget providers, DNS providers, data management services, Web hosting, and Web development. We provide our Service Providers with only the information necessary for them to perform these services. Each Service Provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information involved in order to protect your information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information for purposes other than as specified by Forum Software Reviews.</p>
