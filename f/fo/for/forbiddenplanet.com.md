This allows us to tell you about new products or services that may be of interest to you. Again, we do use a number of external companies to help us provide such marketing services.

We maintain a comprehensive data management work programme, which includes processes for ensuring that data protection is a key consideration of all new and existing IT systems that hold customers personal data. Where any concerns, risks or issues are identified, we conduct relevant impact assessments in order to determine any actions that are necessary to ensure optimum privacy.

We also maintain an active information security work programme which seeks to protect the availability, confidentiality and integrity of all physical and information assets. Specifically, this programme helps us to:

  * Protect against potential breaches of confidentiality
  * Ensure all IT facilities are protected against damage, loss or misuse
  * Increase awareness and understanding across our business of the requirements of information security, and the responsibility of colleagues to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information that they handle.



We recognise that the security of data and transactions on this website is of primary importance. We therefore ensure that all connections to the site are securely encrypted and authenticated using strong protocols, key exchanges and ciphers. Our servers are updated with the latest security patches and fixes on a regular basis.

SagePay is a level 1 payment service provider (the highest level) under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). More information can be found in [SagePay’s security policy](https://www.sagepay.co.uk/policies/security-policy/).
