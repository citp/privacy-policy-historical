    merchants and others who participate in the Forex Robot World Cup 
    Organization's services are encouraged to participate in industry privacy 
    initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="emphasis">3. Information We Collect And How We Use It</p>
    The owners and publishers of http://www.forex-robot-world-cup.com collect 
    certain information from and about its users in three ways - directly from 
    our Web Server logs, the user, and with Cookies.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>a.</strong> Web Server Logs<br>
    <br>
    When you visit our Website, we may track information to administer the site 
    and analyze its usage.<br>
    <br>
    Examples of information we may track include but not limited to:<br>
    <br>
    Your Internet protocol address.<br>
    The kind of browser or computer you use.<br>
    Number of links you click within the site.<br>
    State or country from which you accessed the site.<br>
    Date and time of your visit.<br>
    Name of your Internet service provider.<br>
    Web page you linked to our site from.<br>
    Pages you viewed on the site.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>b.</strong> Use of Cookies<br>
    <br>
    The owners and publishers of http://www.forex-robot-world-cup.com may use 
    cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small 
    text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies cannot 
    be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are 
    uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain 
    that issued the cookie to you.<br>
    <br>
    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature 
    to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate 
    within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information 
    on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering 
    relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your 
    preferences and login information as well as providing personalized 
    functionality.<br>
    <br>
    The owners and publishers of http://www.forex-robot-world-cup.com reserve 
    the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner companies, but 
    does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website unless there 
    is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into 
    http://www.forex-robot-world-cup.com a site that relies on third-party 
    cookies).<br>
    <br>
    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
    automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
    setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser 
    settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on 
    our Website.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>c.</strong> Personal Information Users<br>
    <br>
    Visitors to our website can register to purchase services. When you 
    register, we will request some personal information such as name, address, 
    e-mail, telephone number or facsimile number, account number and other 
    relevant information. If you are purchasing a service, we will request 
    financial information. Any financial information we collect is used only to 
    bill you for the services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, 
    this information may be forwarded to your credit card provider. For other 
    types of registrations, we will ask for the relevant information. You may 
    also be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide 
    assistance and information to you. For example, such data may be warranted 
    in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting.<br>
    <br>
    We will not disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you 
    to third parties without your permission except to the extent necessary, 
    including:<br>
    <br>
    To fulfil your service requests for services.<br>
    To protect ourselves from liability,<br>
    To respond to legal process or comply with law, or<br>
    In connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="emphasis">4. Use Of Web Beacons Or GIF Files</p>
    http://www.forex-robot-world-cup.com's web pages may contain electronic 
    images known as Web beacons, sometimes also called single-pixel gifs, that 
    allow the owners and publishers of http://www.forex-robot-world-cup.com to 
    count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. 
    The owners and publishers of http://www.forex-robot-world-cup.com may 
    include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order 
    to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.<br>
    <br>
    Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to 
    help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or e-mail 
    communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to 
    place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider 
    to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or e-mails and 
    compiles anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in 
    turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and 
    e-mails bring you to our website and how you use the site. The owners and 
    publishers of http://www.forex-robot-world-cup.com prohibit Web beacons from 
    being used to collect or access your personal information.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="emphasis">5. Accessing Web Account Information</p>
    We will provide you with the means to ensure that personally identifiable 
    information in your web account file is correct and current. You may review 
    this information by contacting our support attendants via our <strong>Contact</strong> page.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="emphasis">6. Under The Age Of 18</p>
    The Forex Robot World Cup Organization does not knowingly collect or solicit 
    Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under the age of 
    18. If we discover we have received any information from a child under the 
    age of 18 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information 
    immediately. If you believe the Forex Robot World Cup Organization has any 
    information from or about anyone under 18, please contact us at the address 
    listed below.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="emphasis">7. Changes To This Statement</p>

    discretion to occasionally update this privacy statement. We encourage you

    are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Your continued 
    use of the service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and 
    any updates.<br>
