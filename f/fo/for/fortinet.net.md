# Fortinet Privacy Policy | Fortinet

Effective Date: October 3, 2014

This Privacy Policy discloses the Fortinet privacy practices related to the site [www.Fortinet.com](https://web.archive.org/index.html) and other Fortinet web sites and documents that link to this Privacy Policy (“Services”).

**Information You Provide to Us**

When you use the Services, we may collect and store personal information that you provide to us, including, among other information: your name; address; phone number; email address; and credit card number or other payment details. For example, we collect this information when you fill out an online form, contact us for information or customer support, register to use a service, make a purchase, and request certain features (e.g., newsletters, updates, and other products). If you do not wish to have your payment details stored, please contact Customer Support at the number listed below. 

In order to tailor our communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. You always have the option of choosing not to provide us with this information.

The Services may enable you to send communications to us or to third parties, such as through our live chat feature. All such communications become our property once you submit them. Whenever you choose to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may be contacted in return. Please use your discretion when deciding whether and what to communicate. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to monitor, edit or delete communications transmitted to us or that are made publicly available on the Services. This reservation of rights shall not under any circumstances obligate us to conduct such edits or deletions, nor shall it cause us to be liable for any such edits or deletions.

**Automatically-Collected Information**

We may automatically collect information about how you access and use the Services. For example, we may collect and store information such as your browser type, IP address, language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, the pages you view, the services you use, the date and time of your visit, the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting our websites, error logs, and other hardware and software information. Fortinet maintains log files of the traffic that visits our sites. We do not link any information gathered in these log files to personal information. Log files are used to manage traffic loads and information technology requirements for providing reliable service. We may use third party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, and various technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. We may use this information to formulate statistical models about use of the Services, enhance the Services for our users, and provide you with tailored content and advertising. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on by [clicking here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

We may also employ certain applications, such as the various components of Security Center, to retrieve information about your computer system to assist us in the provision of services that you have chosen to subscribe to or use. This information is essential to enable us to provide you with quality service, and for that reason there is no opt-out available for this information collection.

_Our Use of Cookies_. This Services may use “cookie” technology and similar online tools, such as web beacons and web pixels. “Cookies” are small files that a website stores on a user’s computer or device. We use cookies to identify customers when they visit our sites. Cookies are used to remember user preferences and maximize performance of the Services. Additionally, cookies help us to identify returning users so that we don't ask them to enter their email and password with every visit. Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, the information we collect with cookies is not sold, rented, or shared with any outside parties. We do not use cookies to obtain or retain any personal information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this). Please note that if you decide to block cookies, this may interfere with your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on the Services. For example, we cannot provide subscription services to users who do not give their consent to the data processing carried out through cookies or whose browsers are set to reject all cookies.

_Tailored Advertising_. The Services may include third party tailored ad technology which enables customized ads to be displayed to you through the Services. We do not share information that is intended to identify you personally with these third parties; however, when you use the Services, we or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use device or similar information that is collected through cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, or similar technologies to ensure that appropriate ads are presented and to perform analytics concerning your use of the Services and other websites tracked by these third parties. These technologies also may control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. To the extent any of this information is collected by third parties, you acknowledge and agree that such collection and use is governed by those third parties’ privacy policies and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties.

If you are interested in more information about tailored ads and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored ads, you may visit the following third party websites: the [Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). You can also visit the [Google Ad Settings page](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/) to opt out of receiving tailored ads from Google. Please note that to the extent ad technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive ads even if you opt-out of tailored ads. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, the opt-out services provided by the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance are controlled by those third parties, not Fortinet, and Fortinet does not control which companies choose to participate in those programs.

_Do Not Track_. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the various advertising opt outs above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.

**Information from Third Parties**

We may obtain additional information about you from third parties such as marketers, partners, researchers, and others. We may combine information that we collect from or about you with information we obtain about you from such third parties and affiliates and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.

**Anonymous or De-Identified Data**

We may anonymize and/or de-identify information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information does not identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated, anonymized, and other non-personal information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.

**Use of Your Information**

Fortinet uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to:

  * Process and respond to your inquiries
  * Help you complete a transaction, including fulfillment of orders and promotional offers; 
  * Send you marketing or other communications that may be of interest to you; 
  * Update you on service and benefits;
  * Analyze the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Services;
  * Improve the content and features of the Services or develop new Services;
  * Administer and troubleshoot the Services;
  * Enforce the legal terms that govern the Services;
  * Personalize the Services for you; and 
  * Manage and renew your subscription(s).



Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and fraud protection, and are not used for other purposes without your permission.

**Sharing of Your Information**

Except as provided in the Privacy Policy, Fortinet will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others for commercial gain. We may share your information in the following ways:

  * We reserve the right to engage other companies or individuals to provide limited services on our behalf that may involve sharing your information, such as the activities discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, handling the processing and delivery of mailings, order fulfillment, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, marketing, customer support, or performing statistical analysis. Such parties may not use your personal information for other purposes, unless you agree. 
  * We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal processes; (b) protect the rights or property of Fortinet or our partners or customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies; or (c) protect the personal safety of individuals such as Fortinet employees, partners, customers or the public.
  * We may share your information with any affiliate or agent of Fortinet in order to provide the Services or advertising or to communicate with you on our behalf.
  * We may also disclose, sell or assign personal information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or restructuring.
  * When we have your consent.



**Your Email Marketing Choices**

If you provide us with your email address when you register as a customer or make a purchase from us, we may occasionally send you email with recommendations or notices of new products, prices, and services. This email may include paid advertisements from third parties. At the time you register or make a purchase, you will be given the opportunity to opt into our out of this service. If you do not initially choose to opt out, you may still block future email of this type, simply by following the unsubscribe instructions that accompany all such communications. Please note that these opt-out processes may take some time to complete, consistent with applicable law.

Separately, we send service notifications via email to keep you informed about the status of your service orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. These messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our services. Therefore there is no opt-out available for service notifications and these messages cannot be blocked.

We follow industry standard practices for email marketing and customer contact, and we urge our business partners to do so as well. 

**Third Party Links and Services**

The Services may contain links to third-party websites, including social networking websites. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites or services to which we link. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites or services. The personal information you choose to provide to or that is collected by these third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We strongly encourage you to read such third parties’ privacy policies. 

**Security of Your Personal Information**

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store. 

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personal information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

If a password is used to help protect your personal information, it is your responsibility to keep the password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone.

**How You Can Access and Update Your Personal Information**

To ensure that you have some control over the information we have about you, you may review and update certain user information by logging in to the relevant portions of the Services where such information may be updated (may be available on some Services and not others) or by contacting us at the contact information provided below.

**International Compliance**

Fortinet complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Fortinet has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>. In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Fortinet commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. For all inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy, including European Union or Swiss citizens, should first contact us by [privacy@fortinet.com](mailto:privacy@fortinet.com). Fortinet has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, JAMS SAFE HARBOR PROGRAM, operated by JAMS. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by us, please visit the JAMS' web site for more information and to file a complaint.

Fortinet operates primarily in the United States and as a result, the information we collect may be stored in the United States. Your Personal information may be transferred to, used, processed, or held by Fortinet in the United States and in other countries, including countries outside of your country of residence and used for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

**Your California Privacy Rights.**

California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties. If you are a California resident and would like to request this information, please submit your request in an email to [privacy@fortinet.com](mailto:privacy@fortinet.com).

**Notification of Changes**

Fortinet reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this policy will mean you accept those changes. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here and notify you by email or by means of a notice on our website prior to the changes becoming effective.
