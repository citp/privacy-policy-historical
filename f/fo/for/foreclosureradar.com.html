                <p>ForeclosureRadar understands that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy applies to all of the 
                products, services and websites offered by ForeclosureRadar.</p>                
                
                <h2 class="sm2">Information Collection and Use</h2>                
                
                <p><b>Subscribers</b> - When you subscribe to our service we request certain personally identifiable 
                information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, 
                address and phone) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We 
                use this information for billing purposes and to contact you if necessary. You also may have the 
                option to provide us with demographic information (such as your occupation or interest in foreclosures). 
                We use this information to enhance our services and provide a more personalized experience.</p>
                
                <p><b>Services</b> - Our services allow you to store search criteria, search history, photos, notes, 
                financial analysis, and other information for your convenience and use of the site. We use this 
                information solely to provide you the requested services. Note that you may choose to share this 
                information with other users by adding other users to a group you create, or by joining a group created 
                by another user. Whether or not you enter information into a group shared with other users is solely 
                your decision.</p>
                
                <p><b>Email Alerts</b> - When you sign up for Email Alerts we request your email address and demographic 
                information (such as your occupation or interest in foreclosures). We use this information to provide 
                the requested alerts and to enhance our services and provide a more personalized experience.</p>
                
                <p><b>Referrals</b> - If you choose to use our referral services to tell another party about our site, 
                or send them information from our site, we will ask you for the parties name and email address. We will 
                automatically send the party a one-time email with the information you requested we send, and an 
                invitation to visit the site. We do not store this information and use it for the sole purpose of 
                fulfilling your request.</p>
                
                <p><b>User Communication</b> - When you send email or other communication 
                to ForeclosureRadar, we may retain those communications in order to 
                respond to your inquiry.</p>
                
                <p><b>Cookies</b> - When you visit ForeclosureRadar we send one or more cookies - a small file 
                containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies are 
                used to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as 
                how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser 
                to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some ForeclosureRadar 
                features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.</p>
                
                <p><b>Web Beacons</b> - We may use clear gifs or other technology to monitor your use of our site or if 
                you have viewed an HTML-based email that we send you. This allows us to gauge how you use our site and 
                the effectiveness of our advertising and communications.</p>
                
                <p><b>Log information</b> - When you use ForeclosureRadar services, our servers automatically record 
                information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include 
                information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date 
                and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this 
                information to enhance our services.</p>
                
                <p><b>Links</b> - ForeclosureRadar may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether 
                these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology, 
                customized content and advertising.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sm2">Communications from the Site</h2>
            
                <p><b>Special Offers &amp; Updates</b> - We will occasionally send you information on our products and 
                services in an effort to promote our site. If you have subscribed to our Email Alerts and do not want 
                to receive offers or updates that may be included with them, you may unsubscribe using the link 
                provided in the Email Alert.</p>
                
                <p><b>Service-Related Announcements</b> - We will send subscribers service related announcements when 
                necessary to inform of you service upgrades, outages, or other events that may impact your ability to 
                use the service.</p>
                
                <p><b>Customer Service</b> - Based on the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will 
                send you a welcoming email upon registration. We will also communicate with you in response to your 
                inquiries, to provide services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you 
                by email or telephone as needed.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sm2">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>ForeclosureRadar processes personal information for the purposes described below. ForeclosureRadar 
                does not sell or rent your information to other companies or entities or individuals. We do share 
                subscriber's information in the following circumstances:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>With your consent and approval</li>
                    <li>To initiate or maintain membership</li>
                    <li>Process payment for membership, goods and services</li>
                    <li>In order to obtain services and goods you request</li>
                    <li>For improvements, updates, enhancements, to the operation of this website</li>
                    <li>To investigate a possible  violation of our User Agreement</li> 
                    <li>In response to any court order or any other legal process or to satisfy any applicable law, 
                    regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request</li>
                    <li>To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or</li>
                    <li>To protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of ForeclosureRadar, its 
                    subscribers or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>ForeclosureRadar specifically uses third party services to maintain billing and account information, 
                and to host this site and the related services. These third party services are prohibited from using 
                your personally identifiable for any other purpose.</p>
                
                <p><b>Choices for personal information</b> - When you sign up for a particular service that requires 
                registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we propose to use personal information 
                for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service 
                notices, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those 
                other purposes. You may also decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which 
                case ForeclosureRadar may not be able to provide those services to you.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sm2">Links to Other Sites</h2>
                
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies to web sites and services that are owned and operated by ForeclosureRadar. 
                We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or links from within our various 
                services. These sites will be able to detect that you are visiting from our site, and they may place 
                their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sm2">Information Security</h2>
                
                <p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a 
                credit card number) we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow 
                generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us. No method of 
                transmission over the internet, or electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore while we 
                strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee 
                its absolute security. If you any questions about security on our website please email us at 
                info@foreclosureradar.com.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sm2">Accessing and Updating Personal Information</h2>
                
                <p>ForeclosureRadar will make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information 
                and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not 
                otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users 
                to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before 
                processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or 
                systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be 
                extremely impractical.</p>
                
                <p>Individual customers who reside in California and have provided their personal information may 
                request information regarding disclosures of this information to third parties for direct marketing 
                purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us at the following mailing address:</p>
                
                <p>ForeclosureRadar<br>
                14850 Hwy 4, #290<br>
                Discovery Bay, CA 94514</p>
                
                <p>This request may be made only once per calendar year.  ForeclosureRadar reserves the right not to 
                respond to requests submitted other than to the address specified in this paragraph.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sm2">Changes to This Policy</h2>
                
                <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights 
                under this Policy without providing you an opportunity to opt-out, and we expect most such changes will 
                be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, 
                we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Policy 
                changes).</p>
