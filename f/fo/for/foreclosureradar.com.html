                <p><b>Choices for personal information</b> - When you sign up for a particular service that requires 
                registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we propose to use personal information

                notices, we will offer you a choice to opt out of the use of personal information for those 
                other purposes. You may also decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which

                <h2 class="sm2">Links to Other Sites</h2>
                
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies to any web sites and services that are owned and operated by ForeclosureRadar. 
                We do not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or links from within our various 
                services. These sites will be able to detect that you are visiting from our site, and they may place 
                their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.</p>
                
                <h2 class="sm2">Information Security</h2>
                
                <p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a 
                credit card number) we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow 
                commercially accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us. Nonetheless, no method of 
                transmission over the internet, or electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we 
                strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee 
                its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website please email us at 
                info@foreclosureradar.com.</p>

                <p>ForeclosureRadar will make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information 
                and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not 
                otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users 
                to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before 
                processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or 
                systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be 
                extremely impractical.</p>
                
                <p>Individual customers who reside in California and have provided their personal information may 
                request information regarding disclosures of this information to third parties for direct marketing 
                purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us at the following mailing address:</p>

                <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights 
                under this Policy without providing you an opportunity to opt-out, and we expect most such changes will 
                be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant,
