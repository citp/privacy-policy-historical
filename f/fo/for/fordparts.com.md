FordParts.com Online Store knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting FordParts.com Online Store, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

**What Personal Information About Customers Does FordParts.com Online Store Gather?**  
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at FordParts.com Online Store. Here are the types of information we gather.

**Information You Give Us:**  
We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.

**Automatic Information:**  
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses FordParts.com Online Store. Scroll to the bottom of this page to see examples of the information we receive. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at FordParts.com Online Store if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

**E-mail Communications:**  
To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from FordParts.com Online Store if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your account to reflect this by selecting unsubscribed in the newsletters menu.

**Information from Other Sources:**  
For reasons such as improving personalization of our service (for example, providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.

**What About Cookies?**  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as automatic login and permanent shopping carts for storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.  
The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of FordParts.com Online Store's coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

**Does FordParts.com Online Store Share the Information It Receives?**

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:**  
We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, these businesses operate stores at FordParts.com Online Store or sell offerings to you at FordParts.com Online Store.

You can tell when another business is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that business.

**Agents:**  
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.

Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of FordParts.com Online Store customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your account newsletter preference as that is how we will send out our promotions.

**Business Transfers:**  
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that FordParts.com Online Store, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

**Protection of FordParts.com Online Store and Others:**
