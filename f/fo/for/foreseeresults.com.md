# Privacy Policy | ForeSee

## ForeSee Results, Inc. Privacy Statement Effective date: May 15, 2013

[](https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/ForeSee-Results/validation?rid=fc7be566-92aa-4667-be44-67d8412088c1 "TRUSTe European Safe Harbor certification")

This Privacy Statement describes how ForeSee Results, Inc. (“ForeSee”) collects, uses, and discloses certain personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) that it receives about the following types of individuals through certain websites, mobile websites, and mobile applications as outlined herein: (i) ForeSee’s own website visitors, (ii) ForeSee’s clients, and (iii) ForeSee’s clients’ customers and website visitors.  ForeSee’s practices with respect to each of these categories of individuals is explained below. The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged ForeSee.

ForeSee recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) and Switzerland have established strict protections regarding the handling of Personal Data, and Foresee therefore has elected to adhere to the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (the “Safe Harbor”) with respect to such Personal Data that it receives in the United States about individuals located in the EU and Switzerland. ForeSee has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. For further background and information about the Safe Harbor, and to see ForeSee’s representation on the Safe Harbor List, please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s website at [www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/).

If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that your Personal Data will be transferred to and processed in the United States.  By using our website, contracting with us to receive our products or services, or submitting any information to us through a customer satisfaction survey or otherwise, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction that may not provide the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your home jurisdiction.

### Personal Data Collection and Purposes of Use

ForeSee collects customer feedback on behalf of its business clients (“Clients”), including some of the biggest players in retail, banking, media, and government.  Feedback is solicited through surveys, which are presented either through an interactive invitation or via email or text message.  Most ForeSee surveys do not solicit Personal Data and, when they do, the information is always optional.  All ForeSee surveys are entirely voluntary.

#### ForeSee’s Clients’ Customers and Website Visitors

ForeSee collects data for our Clients through online and offline (in store and call center) customer satisfaction surveys. The data collected by ForeSee may include the following categories of Personal Data:  name, email addresses, mailing address, and phone number.  ForeSee may also collect the following categories of demographic information:  age, gender, income bracket, education level and race.  If ForeSee combines demographic or other information with Personal Data about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data.  Personal Data does not include aggregated anonymous information.

In some instances, a Client may also provide ForeSee data about its customers or website visitors, which may include information about your use of the Client’s website and your relationship or transactional history with the Client.  ForeSee and/or the Client may combine this information with the data you provided in a survey response.  Please refer to the Client’s posted privacy policy to determine what information the Client may provide ForeSee.

The data ForeSee collects belongs to our Clients, and ForeSee uses the data to compile reports on customer satisfaction for our Clients.  Aggregated anonymous information may be provided to third-parties including media outlets, and does not include any Personal Data.

ForeSee may email customer satisfaction surveys to Client customers or website visitors.  Because ForeSee is acting as the Client’s agent, if the customer or website visitor chooses to opt-out of future emails, the opt-out will be Client-specific, and does not apply to other emails sent by ForeSee.  Data collected in response to an email is handled in the same manner as other Client customer and website visitor data, as described in this Privacy Statement.

ForeSee will not request, access or otherwise track any location based information from a Client’s customer’s or visitor’s mobile device.  Please refer to the Client’s posted privacy policy to determine what information the Client may collect.

Wherever we obtain access to Personal Data about our Clients’ customers or website visitors, we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf of our Clients, and we therefore process such Personal Data strictly in accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them.  ForeSee’s Clients are the data controllers and data owners.  If you are a customer or website visitor with an existing relationship with one of our Clients, you should refer to the Client’s website to understand the privacy practices that apply to Personal Data that we may maintain about you on behalf of the Client.  Our Clients are encouraged to participate in privacy initiatives to protect the privacy and security of the data collected.  However, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of our Clients, we cannot be responsible for their actions.  We recommend that you always review the privacy policies of the Client for which you have been presented a survey before you provide any Personal Data.  If you would like to access and review your Personal Data, you should contact our Client with any such requests.  We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our Clients to assist with such responses and will respond to such requests within 30 days.

#### ForeSee’s Clients

ForeSee provides a wide variety of services and solutions, including providing Clients with comprehensive consumer experience measurement analytics through customer satisfaction surveys and related tools.  In connection with providing the services and solutions, ForeSee may obtain information about individual Client employees, including Personal Data about the Client contact such as name and contact information.  ForeSee may use this information for business purposes, including to deliver or provide products or services to our Clients, to establish or maintain client and business relationships and manage Client accounts, and to provide customer feedback to our Clients as necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business relationship.  In addition, if you are a current ForeSee Client, we may send you service-related as necessary, for example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance.  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.  We will occasionally send you information on ForeSee products or services we think may be of interest to you if you are a Client or choose to sign up for our newsletter.  If you do not want to receive this type of information, you may opt-out from these types of communications by following the instructions included in each communication, or by contacting us at [ForeSeePrivacy@answers.com](mailto:ForeSeePrivacy@answers.com).

Our Clients may contact us if any of their Personal Data changes, they wish to have inaccurate data deleted, or if they would like to access and correct Personal Data that we maintain about them. They may contact us by sending an email to [ForeSeePrivacy@answers.com](mailto:ForeSeePrivacy@answers.com), or by using the information at the end of this Privacy Statement. We will respond to your request to access and/or correct your Personal Data within 30 days.

#### ForeSee’s Website Visitors

If you visit our website located at [www.foresee.com](http://www.foresee.com/) and download information or choose to contact us, you may provide certain Personal Data about yourself, such as your name, email address, phone number and mailing address.  We use this information to respond to your inquiry and, if necessary, to correspond with you.

#### Surveys with Sweepstakes Incentives

In certain instances, ForeSee’s surveys include sweepstakes incentives. When a survey includes a sweepstakes incentive, entry in the sweepstakes is entirely optional. Survey responses may be submitted without entering the sweepstakes. Please refer to the specific sweepstakes rules for further detail. In all cases, any contact information collected by ForeSee, including but not limited to name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number, is only used to manage the sweepstakes, subject to the sweepstakes rules and the terms of the Client’s privacy policy.

### Disclosures of Personal Data

ForeSee does not sell any Personal Data gathered from individual survey respondents and does not share any Personal Data with third parties for their own marketing purposes. Personal Data collected by ForeSee is only disclosed to ForeSee’s Client or as directed by the Client in accordance with the contractual relationship, or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Statement.

ForeSee may disclose Personal Data to business partners and subcontractors, such as sweepstakes administrators, as necessary in connection with the performance of requested services or solutions, or as otherwise appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need. ForeSee may also disclose Personal Data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In these situations, ForeSee will require the recipient of the Personal Data to protect the Personal Data in accordance with the relevant principles in the Safe Harbor, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the Personal Data is appropriately protected. ForeSee may also disclose Personal Data where required or permitted by law, or where ForeSee believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request.

### Data Retention

ForeSee retains all data, including the Personal Data we process on behalf of our Client, for as long as needed to provide services. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Cookies on our Site

Many websites use “cookies” to help personalize a website visitor’s online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on the hard drive of a computer by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies by changing the browser preferences. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the services or websites you visit. We use session level cookies on [www.foresee.com](http://www.foresee.com/) to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session level cookie expires when you close your browser. We do not link any Personal Data you provide to cookies.

### Third Party Cookies

The use of cookies by our third party tracking utility company is not covered by our Privacy Statement. We do not have access to or control over these cookies. Our tracking utility company uses session level cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to track how many pages a particular visitor has passed over.

### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our website visitors’ Personal Data. We do not link Personal Data you provide to clear gifs.

### Cookies In Our Surveys

Cookies related to ForeSee’s surveys are deployed by the Client, consistent with the Client’s website privacy policy. You should refer to the Client’s website privacy policy for additional information on their use of cookies.

Session level cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session, when you close your browser. ForeSee’s survey mechanism places a session level cookie on respondents’ browser to track non-personal information such as: the number of pages a particular visitor has passed over; what page the visitor was viewing when the survey appeared; what language, browser and operating system a visitor is using; the referring website (i.e., Google); and any search terms that brought the visitor to the website. We use this technique to gather the data described above, to ensure that a visitor has sufficiently browsed the site in order to adequately answer the survey, and to prevent an individual from getting a survey multiple times in a single session.

Persistent cookies are automatically deleted on a set expiration date. A persistent cookie will only be placed if the company employing ForeSee allows for this type of cookie to be utilized. This persistent cookie will only be used to track that a particular respondent has been presented a survey invitation and has completed or declined the survey to help ensure that the individual does not receive the survey again within a reasonable amount of time. ForeSee does not collect any Personal Data with this persistent cookie, and does not track any visitor once they have left the given site.

### Children Under 13

In most cases, ForeSee’s customer satisfaction surveys and website are not designed or intended for use by children under 13, although the sites we survey may offer children’s products for purchase by adults and/or children’s services. If you are under 18, you should not participate in our survey or use our site without the permission and in the presence of a parent or guardian. In rare instances, a ForeSee Client may choose to survey children under 13; such surveys will not solicit Personal Data. Children under 13 may not submit any Personal Data to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any Personal Data about a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it immediately. Children over 13 should only provide us with Personal Data if they have explicit permission from a parent or legal guardian.

### Data Security and Integrity

ForeSee takes reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data stored in its global hosting centers and in other locations in the United States from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We use secure server hosting locations with 24×7 security monitoring, firewall protection, controlled access, and encryption technology to protect your Personal Data. When our Clients enter sensitive information (such as login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. ForeSee also makes reasonable efforts to keep all Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete.

If you have any questions about our security practices, you can contact us via email at [ForeSeePrivacy@answers.com](mailto:ForeSeePrivacy@answers.com) or by using the information at the end of this Privacy Statement.

### Public Forums

Our website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [ForeSeePrivacy@answers.com](mailto:ForeSeePrivacy@answers.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### Social Media Widgets

Our website includes Social Media Widgets, such as the Facebook share button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

### Links to Other Sites

If you click on a link to a third party website, including on an advertisement, you will leave the ForeSee site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Data by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as ForeSee. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party website that you visit. If you visit a third party website that is linked to a ForeSee site, you should read that website’s privacy policy before providing any Personal Data.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes to this Privacy Statement on the home page of our website, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
