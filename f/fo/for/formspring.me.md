If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy on the home page of the Site and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@formspring.me](mailto:privacy@formspring.me). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information (defined below), we will delete such information from our files and disable their account.

## Information Collection and Use

Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, to administer your account and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. 

### Personal information 

  * In the course of using the Site, we will ask you to provide us with certain personal information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“ ** _Personal Information_** ”). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name and email address. Please be aware that when you register with Formspring and set up an account (each a “ ** _Formspring Registered User_** ”), other users of the Site will be able to see your username, in addition to any questions, answers or comments that you post to the Site or submit via the services subject to the “user preferences” you set in your account. 
  * We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage ( _e.g._ , without limitation, gender or location (in either case other their own) (“ ** _Non-Identifying Information_** ”). 
  * We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries. 
  * Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example,combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. However, the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Formspring users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality of the Site and our services and to analyze and understand how our Site and services are used. Subject to the section below titled “ ** _Information Sharing and Disclosure_** ,” we may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions. 
  * We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Formspring newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. We will endeavor to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to remove your Personal Information from our databases or those of our third party service providers (i.e., to which we have already provided your Personal Information as of the date that we implement your opt-out request). Formspring does not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Information with third parties for such third party's direct marketing purposes. See the section below titled “Information Sharing and Disclosure” for further information regarding how we share your Personal Information.

Such information may, for example, be accessed by everyone on the Internet (including people not logged into Formspring), be indexed by third party search engines, and be imported, exported, distributed, and redistributed by us and others without privacy limitations. Such information may also be associated with you, including your name and profile picture, even outside of Formspring, such as on public search engines and when you visit other sites on the internet. The default privacy setting for certain types of information you post on Formspring is set to “public.” You can review and change the default settings in your [privacy settings](http://www.formspring.me/account/privacy/), and also select to make your account “Protected” which allows you to control who has access to viewing your profile.

## Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Formspring service, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Site and the Formspring service.

If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Formspring service. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your computer's browser, which permit them to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. The collection and use of such information is subject to such third party's privacy policy.

We may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “ ** _Pixel Tags_** ”) in connection with our Site to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on a user's hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.

## Security

Formspring is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We are not in the business of providing information security.

## International Transfer

Your information may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to Formspring, please be advised that we transfer Personal Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

## Phishing

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Formspring. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.

## Links to Other Sites

The Site contains links to other websites and online services that are not owned or controlled by Formspring. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website, content or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services. These other websites and services may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit. Formspring is not responsible for the practices of other websites or online services.
