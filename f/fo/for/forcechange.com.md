# Privacy Policy - ForceChange

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, ForceChange.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ForceChange.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ForceChange.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ForceChange.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

ForceChange.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. ForceChange.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to ForceChange.com’s websites choose to interact with ForceChange.com in ways that require ForceChange.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ForceChange.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, visitors who comment or create other content are asked to provide a username and email address. In each case, ForceChange.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ForceChange.com. For another example, visitors who sign petitions will be contacted by ForceChange.com about that cause and related causes. Visitors who explicitly choose to be contacted and to sign petitions sponsored by sites other than ForceChange.com, such as Care2.com, may be contacted by those organizations.

ForceChange.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

ForceChange.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ForceChange.com’s behalf or to provide services available at ForceChange.com’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ForceChange.com’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, ForceChange.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when ForceChange.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ForceChange.com, third parties, or the public at large.
