**Rectification** | You can ask us to rectify inaccurate personal data. 

We may seek to verify the accuracy of the data before rectifying it.

##### ·       you have withdrawn your consent (where processing was based on consent); or

##### ·       following a successful right to object (see ‘Objection’ below); or

##### ·       it has been processed unlawfully; or

  * to comply with a legal obligation.



We are not required to comply with your request to erase your personal data  if the processing of your personal data is necessary:

##### ·       for compliance with a legal obligation; or

##### ·       for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;

There are certain other circumstances in which we are not required to comply with your erasure request, although these two are the most likely circumstances in which we would deny that request  
  
**Restriction** | You can ask us to restrict (i.e. keep but not use) your personal data, but only where: 

##### ·       its accuracy is contested (see Rectification), to allow us to verify its accuracy; or

##### ·       the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or

##### ·       it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or

  * you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.



We can continue to use your personal data following a request for restriction, where:

  * we have your consent; or
  * to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
  * to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.

  
**Portability** | You can ask us to provide your personal data to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format,  or you can ask to have it ‘ported’ directly to another Data Controller, but in each case only where: 

##### ·       the processing is based on your consent or on the performance of a contract with you; _and_

  * the processing is carried out by automated means.

  
**Objection** | You can object to any processing of your personal data which has our ‘legitimate interests’ as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. 

We have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms.  
  
**International Transfers** | You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area. 

We may redact data transfer agreements or related documents (i.e. obscure certain information contained within these documents) for reasons of commercial sensitivity.  
  
**Supervisory Authority** | You have a right to lodge a complaint with the responsible local supervisory authority about our processing of your personal data. 

We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues with us first, although you have a right to contact your supervisory authority at any time.
