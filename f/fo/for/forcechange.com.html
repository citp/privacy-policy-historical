       						<p>We (“the Company”, “we”, “ForceChange”, “Animal Petitions”, “Play4Paws”, “Limited Liability Company”, or “us”)&nbsp;are a limited liability company and have established this privacy policy to explain to you how your information on ForceChange is protected, collected and used, which may be updated by us from time to time.</p>
<p>Protecting your privacy</p>
<p>The Company maintains the right to send you information via the postal mail services of your jurisdiction if such mailing is permissible pursuant to the laws of your jurisdiction. If you do not wish to receive information via the postal mail services, please contact us at https://forcechange.com/contact.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information (defined below) is not shared with any third parties without your consent except as noted below.</p>
<p>We do utilize tracking devices (“cookies”, “web beacons,” single-pixel gifs, etc.).</p>
<p>Cookies are small files that store information about your account, web browser, computer, mobile phone, or other device. Most companies on the web use cookies to enable special features or to provide you with a better, faster, or safer experience.</p>
<p>We use cookies to make ForceChange better and easier to use; to provide you with a more personalized experience; and to protect you, others, and ForceChange from malicious activity. For example, we use cookies to store your login ID (but never your password) so that it’s easier for you to log in when you return to the site. We also use cookies to confirm that you’re logged in to ForceChange.</p>
<p>We do not use cookies to create a profile of your browsing behavior on third-party sites, although we may use anonymous or aggregate data to track overall usage of ForceChange.</p>
<p>You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases, this may impact your ability to use ForceChange.</p>
<p>To remove yourself from a ForceChange email list, simply click “unsubscribe” at the bottom of the email. Notwithstanding the foregoing the Company maintains the right at all times to contact its members for business related purposes (some examples include, but are not limited to: (i) if a user requests a new password, (ii) if the Company chooses to alert its users about a site-related issue, or (iii) in response to an action taken by you using the Company’s products and/or services, such as signing a petition or updating your profile).</p>
<p>If you create a profile on the site, it will be visible to the public, anyone can view it and your profile may be indexed by internet search engines.</p>

<p>If you sign a petition, a profile will be created for you on the site and that profile will be visible to the public, anyone can view it and your profile may be indexed by internet search engines.</p>
<p>We allow third-­-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our web site. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels or other technologies to collect and use both personally identifiable information (e.g., your name, phone number, physical or electronic address) and non-­- personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-­-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance at www.aboutads.info or Networking Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org/choices.</p>

You may request a list of all of the third parties with whom we share your PII by sending an email via https://forcechange.com/contact and place “California Third Party Disclosure” in the subject line. Please allow up to thirty days for a response.</p>
<p>We, or a data provider we have engaged, may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads, content or services.    No personally identifiable information is placed into these cookies.  The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of these cookies or learn more please go to http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. </p>
<p>Additionally, emails we send may contain a bit of code known as a “web beacon.” This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website. Our web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images “off” in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.” </p>

<p>The Company does not knowingly collect information from individuals under the age of 13. If we become informed that a posting has been made by a person under the age of 13, we will remove all materials posted by such individual and will delete the account used by such person to access our website.</p>
<p>Postings and widgets on our website may include content and links from or to third party websites, and such websites will have different privacy policies than those set forth herein. We disclaim all responsibility for compliance with the privacy policies of those third party websites, and strongly urge all users to review such privacy policies.</p>
<p>Data we collect and store</p>
<p>As part of the registration and/or petition signing process, we may collect your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and other contact information (your “Personal Information”) which will be stored in our database. We may additionally track data (including data which has been marked by the user as “Deleted”) relating to your behavior on the website (your “Campaign Activity Information”). Please do not post any personal information in any public forum of ForceChange which you expect to remain private, including, but not limited to, any Personal Information and/or Campaign Activity Information. We also reserve the right to collect any data about you which is publicly available; this data may be obtained by us or by a 3rd party engaged by us to collect such information.</p>
<p>We do NOT collect sensitive information from our users (including, but not limited, to personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual); however, a visitor to the website may be able to ascertain such sensitive information by the data which you choose to display on the Company’s website(s).</p>
<p>We make good faith efforts to store all collected data in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, although we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
