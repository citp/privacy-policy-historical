**FORBES ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY**

The policies below are applicable to Forbes.com, which is owned and operated by Forbes.com Inc. 

As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to the Forbes site, nor is so-called cookie technology used to collect personally identifying information by the sites created by Forbes.com Inc. 

However, certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of Forbes Online's Internet servers. This information is primarily used to provide an enhanced online experience for the visitor. Information tracked includes the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). By having this information, web pages optimized for a particular visitor's computer are automatically available to that visitor. Other uses of this information include internal review of the number of visitors to the sites but only in an aggregate and non-personally identifiable form. E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors to this site are known to Forbes Digital Media only when voluntarily submitted. 

Forbes Online will only collect personally identifying information with prior notification of its users. Cases may include but are not limited to the following: (i) contest or sweepstakes registration and (ii) subscription. In addition, information is collected in certain portions of sites in which guests specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., forums), suggestions, or reader service responses. Forbes Online may use such information for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event Forbes Online plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting.

By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from Forbes.com, you won't be offered as many afterwards.

• Forbes.com does not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as contest registration (where a cookie allows to you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time) and personalization features where a guest requests certain information.
