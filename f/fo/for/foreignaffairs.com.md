We retain information as long as it is necessary to perform our services in accordance with legal requirements and accounting rules. After it is no longer necessary to retain information, we dispose of it in a secure manner.

Your Personal Information is stored on our in-house servers and on cloud-based servers hosted by our vendors.

We take reasonable security measures to protect your information, including the use of physical, technical, and administrative controls. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. When stored, passwords are encrypted and are not recoverable. We use SSL when we transmit Personal Information, and such information is encrypted in transit.

**Contests and Sweepstakes**

When we run a contest or sweepstakes relating to our Sites, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest and sweepstakes will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed if it is different than as described in this Privacy Policy. In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, Personal Information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it.

The Sites are not intended for children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under thirteen years of age.

If we discover that a child under the age of thirteen has provided us with Personal Information and we do not have parental consent, we will immediately delete that child’s information from the Sites. If you believe that we have been provided with the personal information of a child under the age of thirteen without parental consent, please notify us immediately at [privacy@foreignaffairs.com](mailto:privacy@foreignaffairs..com).
