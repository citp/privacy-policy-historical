# Privacy Policy

_Effective Date: October 27, 2015_

Foreign Affairs is published by the Council on Foreign Relations (collectively, “we”, “us” or “our”). This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you, as well as our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information. This Policy applies to your use of the Foreign Affairs’ website and our mobile applications (“Sites”).

By visiting our Sites, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy, including our use of cookies and similar online tools. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Sites. We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. If you continue to use our Sites after changes have been made to the terms, you are accepting those changes.

**Information We Collect**  
When you visit our Sites, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information. Personal information is any information that can individually identify you and includes, but is not limited to, your name, address, and email address, as well as non-personal information that has been linked to your personal information. We only collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. We also collect non-personal information through technology including tracking and usage information about your location, demographics, and use of our Sites.

**Personal Information  
** You may browse our Sites without submitting your personal information to us. However, in order to access some features of our Sites, you may need to provide us with personal information. Personal information is collected when you register to use our Sites; subscribe to Foreign Affairs or one of our newsletters or other content; place an order; make a gift; complete a survey or participate in market research; and/or when you seek employment at Foreign Affairs.

**Non-Personal Information**  
When you interact with our Sites, we may collect non-personal information such as demographic data; information about your computer, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Sites, including IP address, general location information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information. We may also collect information about your use of the Sites, including your search terms and search results, and additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses. Our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of our Sites. In addition to non-personal information, we may collect aggregate data regarding the use of the Sites.

**“Cookies” and Other Tracking Technology**  
We use “cookies,” Web beacons, HTML 5 local storage and other similar tracking technologies. These technologies track your use of our Sites and online services and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. They also help us monitor traffic and continually improve the Sites. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you set your web browser to decline cookies or if you delete your cookies, some features of the Sites may not work or may not work as designed.

We may partner with third party advertising companies to better provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Sites. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content. These advertising partners do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personal information from us, without your consent. They may, however, use persistent identifiers to anonymously track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond these Sites. While we restrict their further use of such information, such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us.

Online advertising for our Sites is delivered by the vendor DoubleClick. DoubleClick places cookies on your browser to facilitate serving particular ads – for instance, to help determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, to tailor ads to you if you have visited our Site before, and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can opt out of DoubleClick’s use of cookies for these purposes by visiting <http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/>.

In some cases, we and advertisers on our Sites and other sites work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements tailored to your interests. These vendors include ad networks and audience segment providers, and they place cookies on your browser to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited) in order to help advertisers deliver particular ads on our Site and other sites that they believe you would find most relevant. You can opt out of those vendors’ use of cookies to tailor advertising to you by visiting [www.aboutads.info/consumers](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers).

Often our advertisers contract with a third-party service to host their ads. In this case, an ad-serving vendor contacts the advertisers’ hosting service for a particular advertisement. In that case, an independent cookie may be used by the third-party service. We do not have a mechanism to allow visitors to opt-out of cookies from vendors with whom we do not have a contractual relationship.

**How Do We Use Your Information?**  
We use the information we learn from you to help improve your experience on the Sites. The information helps us provide you with the content, products and services that you request; to communicate with you about your subscriptions or registrations; send you information about enhancements to the Sites; communicate changes in our policies; personalize your experience on the Sites by recommending specific content; send you newsletters, offers and promotions for our products and services, third party products and services, or special events by e-mail, text, or other another medium; continually improve our Sites; and perform statistical, demographic, and marketing analyses of users of the Sites and their purchasing patterns.

**No Sharing of Your Personal Information**  
We will not disclose or otherwise share your personal information collected from the Sites to any organizations not part of the Council on Foreign Relations or Foreign Affairs, except as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Our Use of Third-Party Agents**  
We have third party agents that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to, hosting, content syndication, content management tools, social media integration, marketing, analytics, billing and customer service. These entities may have access to personal information if needed to perform their functions. If such access is required, the third parties will be obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that personal information. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Sites.

**Our Business Partners  
** From time to time we allow companies whose products or services we feel may interest our print subscribers to advertise to those subscribers, using the names and addresses provided to us during the subscription process. We do not share our subscribers’ names and addresses directly with these companies, however. In those instances, we use a reputable third party to administer the process on our behalf. Many of our subscribers find this a valuable and time-saving service. If you do not want your name and address to be shared for these purposes, you can opt-out of such sharing by e-mailing us at [service@foreignaffairs.customersvc.com](mailto:%20service@foreignaffairs.customersvc.com), or calling or writing us at the contact information provided.

**Our Compliance with Legal Requirements and Protection of the Sites and User  
** In some cases, we may use or disclose your personal information to a third party if we are required to do so by law; to prevent misuse of our Sites; or to protect the personal safety of our employees, agents, partners, the users of the Sites, or the public.

**Options to Protect Your Personal Information  
** You have options regarding the collection, use and sharing of your information. Although you cannot opt-out of all data collection when you visit our sites, you can limit the collection, use and sharing of your information by:

  * Declining to provide your personal information (though this may limit your ability to access all of the features of the Sites);
  * Opting out of having your personal information shared with business partners and third parties for marketing and advertising purposes by e-mailing us at [service@foreignaffairs.customersvc.com](mailto:%20service@foreignaffairs.customersvc.com), or contacting us at the phone numbers or postal address provided below; or
  * Opting out of receiving future e-mail marketing messages and newsletters from Foreign Affairs by following the instructions contained within the emails and newsletters, or by e-mailing, calling or writing us at the addresses below.



**How Do We Protect Your Information?**  
We take reasonable security measures to protect your information, including the use of physical, technical and administrative controls. While we use our best efforts to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, any transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network carries risk. As such, you must take precautions to protect the security of any personal information that you may transmit over any home networks, wireless routers, wireless (Wi-Fi) networks or similar devices by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of your personal information. You are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks.

The time period for which we keep information varies according to the purpose for which it is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.

**Governing Law & Notice to Non-U.S. Users**  
These Sites are published in the United States and comply with all applicable laws of our jurisdictions. If you are uncertain whether this Privacy Policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your personal information to Foreign Affairs.

If you are located outside the United States of America, you should be aware that any personal information that you provide will be transferred to and stored in the United States of America. We will take steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely, but will not otherwise take steps to ensure compliance with applicable laws in each user’s country of residence. By registering or subscribing to the Site or by sending us emails, you expressly agree to such transfer and storage.

**Additional Information**

**Contests, Sweepstakes or Games**  
When we run a contest or sweepstakes or game relating to our Sites, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest, sweepstakes or game will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed if it is different than as described in this Privacy Policy. In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, personal information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it.

**Regarding Children**  
The Sites are not intended for children under 13 years of age and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not provide personal information to us without providing us with consent from your parents. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information and we do not have parental consent, we will immediately delete that child’s information from the Sites. If you believe that company has been provided with the personal information of a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, please notify us immediately at [service@foreignaffairs.customersvc.com](mailto:%20service@foreignaffairs.customersvc.com).

**California Privacy Rights  
** California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Foreign Affairs who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of their personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to [service@foreignaffairs.customersvc.com](mailto:%20service@foreignaffairs.customersvc.com) specifying that you seek your “California Customer Choice Notice.” Please allow thirty days for a response.
