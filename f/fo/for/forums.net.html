						the age of 13. If Forums.net obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information 
						from a child under the age of 13, Forums.net will immediately delete such information from its database.

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Information Collection Practices
					<ol>
						<li>

							Cookies
							<p>
								"Cookies" are text files that are placed on Your computer by websites that You visit or certain emails 
								that You open.  A Cookie acts as a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and 
								that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website.  The 
								purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. Forums.net uses Cookies. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Forums.net uses cookies on the Website for the following purposes: to store a session identifier for You

							</p>
							<p>
								IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES 
								BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF 
								THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES.  IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL

								Information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who
