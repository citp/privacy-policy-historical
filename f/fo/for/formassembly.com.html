		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	  <h3>Our  Commitment to Privacy</h3>
	  <p>Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension  of our commitment to combine the highest-quality services with integrity in  dealing with our users and subscribers. The Policy is designed to assist you in  understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you  provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our  site and our products and services. This statement will be assessed from time  to time against new technologies, business practices and our users’ needs.</p>
	  <h3>What  Information Do We Collect?</h3>
	  <p>When you visit our Web site you may provide two  types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose  that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected  on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
	  <h4>1. Personal  Information You Choose to Provide</h4>
	  <p>When a user completes a form created, or  purchased, by one of our subscribers, the user may choose to provide the  subscriber with personal information, such as:</p>
	  <p>Name</p>
	  <p>Mailing address</p>
	  <p>E-mail address</p>
	  <p>Social security number</p>
	  <p>Health related  information</p>
	  <p>Home and business phone  number</p>
	  <p>Other personal  information (i.e., mother’s maiden name)</p>
	  <p>E-mail Information</p>
	  <p>We ask that subscribers who create forms on our  Site do not use the forms to collect credit card information.&nbsp; However, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MONITOR OR  RESTRICT ALL OF THE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY OUR SUBSCRIBERS.&nbsp; FURTHER, DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT  INFORMATION, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT ALL INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE WILL  REMAIN SECURE.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>In addition to providing the foregoing  information to our subscribers, if you choose to correspond further through  e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your  e-mail address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these  electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information  received by mail and telephone.</p>
	  <h4>2. Web  Site Use Information</h4>
	  <p>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web  site utilizes a standard technology called “cookies” and Web server logs to  collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered  through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits,  the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just  before and just after our Web site. This information is collected on an  aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an  individual.</p>
	  <h3>How Do We  Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</h3>
	  <p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information  for purposes of administering our business activities, providing subscriber  service, and making available other products and services to users.&nbsp; WE DO NOT SELL OR SHARE ANY COLLECTED  INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY OTHER THAN THE SUBSCRIBER TO WHOM YOU CHOOSE  TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO.&nbsp; Occasionally,  we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important  changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find  valuable. The lists used to send you product and service offers are developed  and managed under our traditional standards. </p>
	  <h3>What Are  Cookies?</h3>
	  <p>Cookies are a feature of Web browser software  that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site.  They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the  user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one  Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same  user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related  Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page  and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make  your online experience easier and more personalized.</p>
	  <h3>How Do We  Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</h3>
	  <p>We use Web site browser software tools such as  cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Web site users’  browsing activities in order to constantly improve our Web site and better  serve users. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in  the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Web site to better  meet the needs of our users and subscribers.</p>
	  <p>Cookies help us collect important business and  technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets us trace the paths  followed by users to our Web site as they move from one page to another. Web  server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and evaluate  our Web site’s visitor capacity. We do not use these technologies to capture  your individual e-mail address or any personally identifying information about  you.</p>
	  <h3>Sharing  Information</h3>
	  <p>We do not spam email and we do  not permit our subscribers to spam to the extent we can reasonably prevent such  efforts. Our <a href="/terms-of-service.php">Terms  of Service</a> prohibit all subscribers from engaging in spam activity.  Violations of this policy may result in immediate termination of service and  legal action.</p>
	  <h3>How Can  Your Information be Secured?</h3>
	  <p>We provide the capability for your data to be  encrypted.&nbsp; However, the creator of the  form in which you input data chooses how and whether to encrypt your  information.&nbsp; Before inputting any  sensitive information, determine if encryption is enabled by looking for the  “lock” symbol on your web browser or a yellow highlight in the web browser  address bar.&nbsp; </p>
	  <p>INFORMATION OR E-MAIL THAT YOU SEND TO US MAY  NOT BE SECURE UNLESS WE ADVISE YOU THAT SECURITY MEASURES WILL BE IN PLACE  PRIOR TO YOUR TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION. For that reason, we ask that you do  not send confidential information such as a social security number to us  through an unsecured e-mail.</p>
	  <h3>Information  Security.</h3>
	  <p>We utilize encryption/security software to  safeguard the confidentiality of personal information from unauthorized access  or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.&nbsp; We do not, however, secure your personal  information that is in the possession or control of our subscriber.</p>
	  <h3>How Can  You Access and Correct Your Information?</h3>
	  <p>You may request access to all your personally  identifiable information that we collect online and maintain in our database by  e-mailing support@formassembly.com.</p>
	  <h3>What About  Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</h3>
	  <p>We may disclose information when legally  compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the  law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.</p>
	  <h3>What About  Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site? </h3>
	  <p>We are not responsible for the practices  employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor the information or  content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely  as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web  site.</p>
	  <p>Please remember that when you use a link to go  from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in  effect.&nbsp; Browsing and interaction on any  other Web site, including Web sites which have a link to our Web site, is  subject to that Web site’s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules  and policies before proceeding.</p>
	  <h3>Your  Consent</h3>
	  <p>By using our Web site you consent to our  collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy  Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those  changes on our Web site to keep you aware of what information we collect, how  we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.&nbsp; Your continued or subsequent use of our  services after any such change shall constitute your consent to such change.</p>
