**Non-Personal Information We Collect by Automated Means And How We Use It:**

We also collect certain non-personal information (data in a form that does not support direct association with any specific person or individual) by automated means when you visit the Websites.  Much of this information is collected through the use of third-party tracking services, which includes Google Analytics. The information collected may include usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of users to the Websites, pages visited, web browsing histories, your location and device, social networking activities and similar data. When gathered, this data is used in the aggregate, and not in a manner that is intended to identify you personally. This type of aggregate information may be shared with third parties at any time, including advertisers and marketers.  In addition to the third-party tracking services mentioned above, we also collect this information through various other means, including "cookies," "web beacons" and IP addresses, as further explained below. In conjunction with advertisements that we may serve on the Websites, we also may use “ad pixels” and/or “trackers” that follows and tracks your activities from an ad placement to specific website use/activities.

  * _Cookies_ : A cookie is a piece of information that a web server may place on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve the user experience.  Many cookies last only through a single website session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them.   We use two different types of cookies: session cookies - that track how visitors move through our site during a particular visit; and persistent cookies - small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.



We use these cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

We use the AdWords and Remarketing Lists features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers. Foundation Center and Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to Foundation Center websites. This means that vendors, including Google, will display Foundation Center promotional material on other sites you visit across the Internet.

Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all the features on our Websites. In some cases, Foundation Center may also use another company to operate web servers for our Websites.  Foundation Center uses the cookie information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated in this Privacy Policy.

  * _Web Beacons:_  Certain pages on the Websites contain “web beacons” (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party. Web beacons also may be used to track whether you have opened an HTML email. When the email is opened, a part of the code that makes up the HTML page calls a web server to load the web beacon that then generates a record showing that the email has been viewed. Web beacons may also recognize when the email was opened, how many times it was forwarded, and which URLs (links within the email) were clicked.


  * _IP Addresses_ : When you visit and interact with the Websites, the Company and third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services for us may collect Internet Protocol addresses (each an “IP Address”), as well as browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and page navigation. An IP Address is a unique identifier number that certain electronic devices use to identify and to communicate with each other on the Internet; your Internet Service Provider automatically assigns an IP Address to the computer that you are using.  We gather this information to track web site visitor movement in the aggregate, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Our goal in gathering this information is to learn how our customers and the public are using our service. We may use this information to enhance our Websites or for other lawful purposes.



**How do we protect your information?**  

We implement a variety of industry standard security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. However, no website, application or transmission can guarantee security. Thus, while we have established and maintain what we believe to be reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personally identifying information obtained through the Websites and we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.

We also provide links to provide you with additional resources or information - such as job postings, classifieds, etc.  Please note that unless otherwise indicated we have no affiliation with any of these other websites that you may visit via any such links, and cannot control and are not responsible for the information collection, use, and disclosure practices of such third parties; we encourage you to review and understand their privacy practices and policies, if any, prior to providing any personally identifying information to them. We are not responsible for the content or information of these websites, any products, services, advertising or opportunities that may be offered through these websites, or any other use of the linked websites.
