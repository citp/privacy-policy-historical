# Foursixty >> Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how Foursixty Inc. ("we", "us", "our" or "Foursixty") collects, uses and shares your "Personal Information" - information that identifies, relates to, describes or is capable of being associated with you as a particular individual, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number - and other data through your use of any of Foursixty’s websites, apps, services, code, and/or software (collectively, the "Services").

By accessing the Services, you accept this Privacy Policy, agree to the terms, conditions and notices contained or referenced herein as well as in Foursixty’s Terms of Service located at [http://foursixty.com/terms_conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms_conditions) (the “TOS”), and you consent to collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as described herein. Any capitalized term used, but not defined, herein, has the meaning given to it in the TOS.

### What Information We Collect

We collect two types of Personal Information: (i) personally identifiable information (“PII”), which constitutes any information that can identify an individual directly or through other reasonably available means and is otherwise referred to herein as “personal information”, but does not include information deemed not to be personal information in accordance with applicable law; and (ii) non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”), which is also referred to as aggregate and anonymous data, or is information that would not, in and of itself, identify you. Please note that what one may initially consider to be Non-PII may, in some contexts, such as in respect of small geographic locations or communities, result in such information being attributable to you or allowing you to be identified because of the context. Please consider this when providing information.

### What Information We Ask You For

When you register with the Services as an Artist, you will be asked to provide us with certain PII about yourself such as your band name, email address and first and last name of band members.

When you register with the Services as an end-user, you will be asked to provide (or, to the extent that you are creating an account through an API such as Facebook Connect, we will collect) certain PII about yourself, such as your Facebook ID, email address, first and last name and what bands/artists that you “like” or have become a fan of on Facebook.

In addition, we may permit you to import your account information from a third party API to make the registration process easier. In such circumstances, we will collect information from such third party and may ask that you provide additional information in the event we are not able to access required information from the API.

### What Information We Automatically Gather

Some Non-PII is automatically collected when you use or visit the Services. We collect and store information related to your use of the Services, such as your IP Address, and information pertaining to your mobile device, session key, network, protocols and software and the date and time of your visit. The Non-PII we automatically collect is used to help us provide a more relevant and useful site experience to you. This information is also used in the aggregate to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Services.

The Non-PII is typically collected through “cookies”. A cookie is a small piece of information that can be stored by your web browser on your hard drive. We use “persistent cookies” to store your Credentials for future logins to the Services. When you revisit the Services, our server will recognize the cookie and collect the aforementioned information. Additionally cookies are used to help us analyze the Services usage more accurately by keeping tracks of User interaction. Our cookies do not collect your name, email address, contact information or other PII. If you are uncomfortable with our practice of using cookies, you can disable all cookies through your browser settings; however, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

### What Other Information May Be Collected

We may allow you to access third party services, such as Facebook and Twitter, to share your account/profile with those services, and import/export information about you, and who you are connected with on those other services, so you can connect with them on the Services or elsewhere. Some of those third party services may also provide us with information from your accounts. You can always opt out of sharing with such third party services on your account page.

Feedback. You should feel free to give us feedback, register a complaint, or ask questions about the Services. We may store your communications, including any Personal Information you include in them, so that we can effectively respond to you.
