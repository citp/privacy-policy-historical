# Privacy Policy | FourPx Articles

  * Anonymous Information
  * Personal Information



**Anonymous Information**

We may collect information to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their date of birth – they are ‘anonymous’ to us. Another example of FourPx Articles website collecting anonymous information is when the FourPx Articles are invited to respond to surveys/polls on FourPx Articles website. The surveys/polls may ask you for demographic information such as your age, gender and postcode. This information is collected for research purposes, is used in the aggregate (where possible), and remains anonymous. Many of the individuals who access our services are anonymous to us.

**Personal Information**

The website will collect personal information that lets us know the specifics of who you are such as your name, email address, or postal address, when you provide it to us. With this information, FourPx Articles websites can provide a variety of personalized and enhanced services that are not available to anonymous users.

Sometimes, we may specifically ask for personal information about you when you sign up to use a service. Certain information may be required, such as your name, age, internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number, in order to provide that service or product to you. This information may also be used to inform you of additional products and services which may interest you.

**Use of Anonymous Information**
