# Privacy Policy | Legal | Site

Your privacy is very important to us. We protect it from third parties and from other users of this service.

  


## Information you share with us

We need to collect information about you to provide you with the Services or the support you request. Additionally, you can choose to voluntarily provide information to us.

**Information we collect from you**

**Account information:** If you choose to create a Founder2be account, you must provide us with some personal information, such as your username, email address, a password, city, country, your expertise and your primary role as a co-founder.

Following the initial account creation, you may choose to complete your profile by providing additional information such as a profile image (e.g., photo), a canvas image, your birth date (displayed only as age in years), a secondary role as co-founder, interest in startups, time availability and financial contribution, experience with startups and/or fundraising, links to your website or your publicly accessible LinkedIn profile, your name and whether you are seeking someone for your own startup or to join someone else’s start-up. You may also indicate the preferences you hold for your potential co-founder with respect to their role, location, availability and prior experience with startups and/or fundraising.

Some of our product features, such as searching and viewing public Founder2be user profiles do not require you to create an account.

On Founder2be, your profile including your username is always listed publicly. You can use either your real name or a pseudonym as your username. Your name and email address are kept private from other members of the service and used for communications between Founder2be and you. We even implemented a dedicated messaging system, so that you do not have to disclose your email address to others.

**Social media account information:** You may choose to sign in to your Founder2be account with your social media credentials. If you choose to do this, the first time you do so you will be asked whether you agree that the social media provider may provide certain information to Founder2be, such as your name, email address, profile photo, city, birthdate, profile link, professional experience, expertise, interests and other information associated with your social media account. We use this information to help you create your account and complete your profile without having to type this information in manually.

If you do not want your information to be shared with Founder2be by the social media provider, then you can simply sign in to your Founder2be account using your Founder2be account credentials instead of your social media account credentials.

**Communication information:** You may choose to visit other members’ Founder2be profiles and communicate with them by sending and receiving messages. When you do so, we process information about which profiles you visit and store and transfer the messages you send to other users.

**Startup information:** You may choose to post an idea for your start-up and share it with others. Just like profiles, ideas are public information on Founder2be. When you post an idea you may share information including a title, description, tags, stage of development, the type of help you’re seeking, and links to further information, e.g. a website or video pitch.

**Upgrade information:** You may choose to upgrade your Founder2be account with a paid Pro Plan. When you do so, you provide us with additional information including your billing address, and optionally a company name and VAT number. We record this information together with what plan you purchased and when. We also display a Pro member badge next to your profile to help you stand out from the crowd and find a co-founder faster.

**Other information:** Information that you voluntarily provide to us, including your survey responses, participation in contests, promotions, suggestions for improvements, or any other actions performed on the Services.

**Information we collect from your use of our Services**

We collect information about you and the devices you use to access the Services, such as your computer, mobile phone, or tablet.

The information that we collect includes:

**Device Information:** Information about your device, including your hardware model, operating system and version, device name, unique device identifier, mobile network information, and information about the device’s interaction with our Services.

**Use Information:** Information about how you use our Services, including your access time, “login” and “logout” information, browser type and language, country and language setting on your device, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, the domain name of your Internet service provider, other attributes about your browser, mobile device and operating system, any specific page you visit on our platform, content you view, features you use, the date and time of your visit to or use of the Services, your search terms, the website you visited before you visited or used the Services, data about how you interact with our Services, and other clickstream data.

Our Services are general audience services not directed at children, and you may not use our Services if you are under the age of 13. You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Managing your information with us

We generally retain your information as long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law.

If you reside in the European Union, you have the right under the General Data Protection Regulation to request from Founder2be access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data, data portability, restriction of processing of your personal data, the right to object to processing of your personal data, and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you reside outside of the European Union, you may have similar rights under your local laws.

To request access to or rectification, portability or erasure of your personal data, or to delete your Founder2be account, please see below.

**Personal information**

You may access, change, or correct information that you have provided by logging into your account and [update your profile](https://www.founder2be.com/index.php/View-user-details) at any time. You may request a copy of your personal information by submitting a [request](https://founder2be.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to our customer support.

If you decide to opt out, we can still send you non-promotional communications about your account or our ongoing business relations.

  


## Security

Your account is protected by the password you choose. Just as with most Internet services, the security of your information depends on this password, and how well you safeguard access to your account from others. Fortunately, this is not very difficult.

You can prevent unauthorized access to your account by choosing a longer password containing numbers and letters, by limiting the access to your computer and browser, and by logging out from your account when you are done using the service.

Should you have accidentally disclosed your password to someone, or otherwise come to suspect someone might be accessing your account, you can easily change your password by choosing a new one in your profile information.

While we would certainly like to be able to, we cannot guarantee the security of user information at all times. We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, the internet is not a 100% secure environment, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of the transmission or storage of your information. We hold information about you both at our own premises and with the assistance of third-party service providers.

  


## Storage and processing

We may, and we may use third-party service providers to, process and store your information in the European Union, United States, and other countries.
