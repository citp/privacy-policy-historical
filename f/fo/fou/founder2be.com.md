# Privacy Policy | Legal | Site

Your privacy is very important to us. We protect it from third parties and from other users of this service.

**Personal information**

Your profile is kept anonymous in the sense that we do not disclose your first name, last name or email address to other users of the service. You are known only by the username you choose when creating your account, as well as the location (city and country) and role you specify.

You have the choice to provide further information at your discretion, so that other users can better decide to contact you and vice versa. If you decide to include, for example, a profile picture, or a description of your skills or motivation, then this will be visible to other users of the service. If you enter your birthdate, then this is displayed as age in years, and not as your exact birthdate.

We even implemented a dedicated messaging system, so that you do not have to disclose your email address to others.

If you decide to upgrade to a pro account, all information collected during this process is kept confidential from others as well.

As you can see, we do take your privacy serious and strive to keep your information secure.

**Other information**

Your browser may provide other information when you use the Internet. We may receive the same information your browser sends to any other site on the Internet. For example, if you use Firefox or Internet Explorer, if your computer runs on MacOS or Windows, whether you are visiting from a mobile device, and others. We may use this information to improve the quality of this service.

**Integration with 3rd party services**

Founder2be intregrates with 3rd party services to increase the chances of finding a co-founder, and make the experience of having and discussing ideas, connecting with other users, and founding a start-up in general more social.

Founder2be allows you to connect your account to Facebook. You can do so at registration or afterwards. During this process, you are asked for permission to connect to your Facebook account to help complete your Founder2be profile, etc. This will happen only once. Without granting the permission, we will not be able to connect your Facebook account for you.

If you prefer to register without connecting to Facebook, you are welcome to use our own registration form for this purpose. Founder2be may offer functionality such as commenting of ideas, sharing links to ideas, etc. which might not work if your Facebook account is not connected. Should you change your mind and decide to connect your Facebook account to take advantage of this extra functionality, you can do so at any point in time also later.

Please note that the information you provide as it is visible to other users on this site, may also be visible on select partner websites or published by sharing on third-party services such as Facebook, Twitter and others.

**Communications**

An integral part of Founder2be are the communications we send to help you find a co-founder. These include notifications, for example, when someone comments on an idea you shared, visits your profile, or sends you a message via the built-in messaging system, as well as our monthly newsletter, which includes useful information regarding everything start-up and co-founder related. Should you choose to no longer receive the monthly newsletter or other notifications, you can do so any time either by adjusting your message settings, clicking the unsubscribe link contained in the footer, or simply contacting us at [info@founder2be.com](mailto:info@founder2be.com).

**Keeping your information secure**

Your account is protected by the password you choose. Just as with most Internet services, the security of your information depends on this password, and how well you safeguard access to your account from others. Fortunately, this is not very difficult.

You can prevent unauthorized access to your account by choosing a longer password containing numbers and letters, by limiting the access to your computer and browser, and by logging out from your account when you are done using the service.

Should you have accidentally disclosed your password to someone, or otherwise come to suspect someone might be accessing your account, you can easily change your password by choosing a new one in your profile information.

While we would certainly like to be able to, we cannot guarantee the security of user information at all times. Unforeseen circumstances such as hardware or software failures and other factors may compromise the security of it at any time.

**Account deletion**

Should you ever wish to delete your account, for example after you decide to start a project or found a company with some fellow members you got on touch with here, simply let us know by contacting us at [info@founder2be.com](mailto:info@founder2be.com). We will delete your account including the personal information you provided. Please note that we may have back-ups of your information for 90 days after we deleted your account. This is the price we pay for running this service in an as reliable way as we can.

On the other hand, why delete your account even after you found a co-founder? Let us know and we'll write a success story to inspire others and help drive traffic to your new startup's website or app!

**Business transfer**

Company may choose to acquire other companies or may in turn be acquired itself by another company. In such cases, business assets, typically including user information, are transferred to another company. If Company, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by another party. You acknowledge that such transfers may happen, and that any acquirer of Company may continue to use your personal information as protected by this policy.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you with an announcement on our service or via email. The most current version will always be at www.founder2be.com/privacy. All user information is protected by the most recent version of our Privacy Policy, and our users are bound to it if they continue to use the Service after the changes have been first posted.

**Questions**

In case you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us any time at [info@founder2be.com](mailto:info@founder2be.com).

Effective Date: January 1st, 2011
