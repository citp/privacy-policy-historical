# Cookies, Privacy and GDPR Policy Page - FourWeekMBA

## **Cookies**

To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device. Most big websites do this too.

## **What are cookies?**

A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size, and other display preferences) over some time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. 

## **How do we use cookies?**

_This site is hosted by WordPress.com, and as such it  _makes use of cookies for a variety of different purposes. These include those that are ‘strictly necessary’ for technical reasons; those that enable a personalized experience for visitors and registered users; and those that allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action, such as clicking the ‘like’ or ‘follow’ button on a post.

To have a complete overview, you can consult the [WordPress.com Cookie Page](https://en.support.wordpress.com/cookies/).

## **ABOUT COOKIES & LOG FILES**

This website utilizes industry standard analytics packages which gather limited information on visitors to our website automatically, and stores this anonymous information in server log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, basic IP information, referring pages, the operating system used and date/time stamps. This information does not identify individual users; it is used only for site administration, as well as for analysis of website usage and trends.

Additionally, cookies may be used to provide easier and faster access to website features such as logins and repeat visits. Cookies are very small text files that are stored on personal computers for reference purposes.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when your browser is closed, and a persistent cookie may stay on your hard drive for an extended period. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our site; persistent cookies can perform such activities as storing your account password, so you do not have to sign in every time you visit your account page.

We have no access to or administration abilities over any cookies that are used by any advertisers on our site.

## **How to control cookies**

You can **control and delete** cookies as you wish – for details, see [aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).
