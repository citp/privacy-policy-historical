# Privacy

**1\. On Our Web Site and Mobile App**

**_A. Initially Upon Contact With Our Web Site_**

When you visit our web site fourseasons.com you are initially given a "cookie", and your computer is assigned an ID number. A cookie is a commonly used piece of software that tracks an individual user's preferences, and is capable of enhancing your visit to the site. Cookies allow us to provide a customized experience without the visitor having to remind us of his or her preferences each time she or he visits our site. If you log in as a registered user, our cookies may collect personal information for marketing purposes, and to make content on fourseasons.com more relevant and easier to use.  Four Seasons cookies are used to enhance your experience on [www.fourseasons.com](http://www.fourseasons.com/) and to provide you with Four Seasons targeted advertising that may be of interest to you. We do not share your activity on [www.fourseasons.com](http://www.fourseasons.com/) with other third parties, nor do we collect information from other websites you may visit.  By not blocking the use of cookies, you will be deemed to have consented to the use of such a cookie by Four Seasons. 

We also use cookies to collect and maintain aggregate web site data (such as the number of visitors to a particular site), which helps us see which areas are popular with our users and which are not. Among other things, this helps us improve and update the site, based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed.

If you do not want to accept cookies, you can block them by adjusting the settings on your Internet browser. Visitors should understand, however, that rejecting cookies will affect your ability to benefit from the conveniences afforded by the use of cookies, and you will not be able to use certain customization features associated with creating a user profile. Please note that because this is a setting on your browser, this adjustment may also block cookies for any website you visit.

Once you have visited our web site and accepted our cookie, an ID number is automatically assigned to your computer or mobile device whenever you visit our web site. Despite the fact that you remain anonymous until you enter Personal Information on the web site, the ID number allows us to log your session, so that we may better assist you should you need some individualized service or support. Once you enter Personal Information on the web site, we associate your ID number with your contact information so we can recognize you on a future visit. We also use it to keep track of information that appears to be of particular interest to you.

**_B. While Browsing Our Web Site and Mobile App_**  
While in the process of browsing our web site, you also provide us with information that does not reveal your personal identity, for example, for what type of destination you are seeking information. We use this aggregated, anonymous data mainly for editorial purposes, but we do not connect it to any Personal Information, such as your name or address.

While you explore our mobile App for information that interests you, you will provide Personal Information when you create a profile or sign in to access an existing profile.

While browsing our web site and mobile App, you may also wish to put in a specific "Information Request" about one of our hotels, resorts or residential properties, or you may wish to participate in one of our on-line surveys or promotions. To respond to this request or to participate in our various programs, we may ask you for Personal Information, such as your name, zip/postal code, e-mail address, and phone number.

In the event you choose to provide us with this information, we will only use it for the purpose we have specified to you, including under this Privacy Policy. We will only e-mail you if you want us to, and you can choose a number of alternate methods by which to receive a reply to a request. Your transmittal of your Personal Information shall constitute your acknowledgment and agreement to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy. If you are uncomfortable providing this information over the Internet, you can always call our Worldwide Reservations Office for more details.

If you wish, you may also submit your e-mail address in order to be placed on a subscription list or to receive other information about our products and services. You will be placed on a subscription list only when you indicate your desire to be included. In deciding whether or not to join such lists, please note that they are only used for internal purposes and we do not sell or rent our subscription lists to anyone. In the event you choose to join one of our subscription lists, you may ask to be removed from the list at any time. You will always have the ability to accept or decline any form of communication from Four Seasons.

If you wish to receive information regarding Four Seasons Residence Clubs or Private Residences you can utilize the link on the Four Seasons web site to the web site of the developer of the particular Residence Club or Private Residence, or send a request through our web site. If you utilize the link, you will be advised that you are now on the developer's web site and that any information you provide through the developer's web site will be protected by the developer in accordance with the developer's privacy policy.

**_C. Making a Purchase on Our Web Site_**

When making a purchase, such as a gift card, you will be asked to complete a form that includes your contact information and payment information. The form is secure (see below). When the form is complete, your credit card number will be verified using a checking sequence, and once this is confirmed we authorize payment for the amount shown on your order form. Once your transaction is confirmed you will see a 'Thank You' screen, and if you requested an e-mail confirmation it will be sent within a few moments. Again, due to the personal nature of the information you provide when making a purchase through our web site, the form is secure, such that your credit card number is protected with encryption technology. Purchasing transactions are assisted by third party processors in Canada who are required by contract with us to protect the privacy of your Personal Information.

We retain a log file of transactions at our web site, excluding your credit card information, connected to your ID number. We will then use that information to assist in any inquiries about your transaction. We also occasionally combine information from a number of web visitors in a way that does not identify any user, in order to identify user patterns.

**2\. When Making a Reservation**

**_A. On Our Web Site and Mobile App_**

You can search for rates and availability at our hotels and resorts without providing any Personal Information.

Visitors to fourseasons.com, vacationrentals.fourseasons.com or users of the Four Seasons mobile App who elect to make reservations online will be required to complete a reservation profile the first time they make a reservation. When you create a reservation profile you will be asked to provide specific Personal Information, including your name, address and contact information, as well as certain guarantee and deposit information to secure your reservation, such as your credit card number. Your transmittal of your Personal Information shall constitute your acknowledgment and agreement to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy.

Your credit card number will be verified using a checking sequence, but we do not authorize any payments at this point. Once you indicate confirmation of your reservation, all of the reservation information that you submitted will be sent to Four Seasons. From this point the information is sent to the selected property in exactly the same way as if you called us directly or if your travel agent made the reservation.

Due to the personal nature of the information you provide when making a reservation through our web site or mobile App, Four Seasons employs encryption technology to keep your data secure.

We also retain a copy of the reservation profile on our web site, excluding the credit card number connected to your ID number. We will then use that information to create a log in our web site database.

We also may combine information from a number of web visitors in a way that does not identify any user, in order to identify user patterns.

**_B. Through our Worldwide Reservations Offices or Hotels_**

Reservations can also be made by calling one of our Worldwide Reservation Offices ("WRO") or by contacting a particular hotel or resort directly. When you make a reservation we may ask you for Personal Information such as your name, address, telephone number and method of payment. We may also obtain from you any room preferences or special requests. Personal Information obtained by WRO will be sent in a secured communication to the relevant hotel or resort. Confirmation of your reservation will be provided to you, generally by e-mail, directly from the hotel or resort.

**3\. During your stay at a Hotel or Resort**

During your stay, we record your itemized spending to properly assemble your folio, which sets out your room rate and other expenses billed to your room. We also record this information to comply with financial reporting requirements, including those imposed by auditors and government regulators. We may also collect certain information as required by local laws (e.g. passport number). Information particular to your stay may also be stored (i.e. health issues, payment difficulties, special requests, service issues). This stay specific information is stored in the property management system at the particular hotel where you stayed and is combined with information from previous visits that you have made to that hotel. Certain information regarding your service preferences is also stored centrally by us and may be made available to other Four Seasons properties through the Four Seasons guest history database. You may advise the hotel if you do not want personal preferences shared.

In addition, we may retain the content of any document (including letters, comment cards, electronic documents such as e-mails and other similar forms of communication) that you send us before, during or following your stay. This information may be shared with employees of the hotel or resort and with Four Seasons.  Finally, in preparation for your stay, we may collect your photograph from publically available sources so that we can recognize you in order to provide you with superior customer service.

**4\. Regarding Residence Club Ownership**

**_A. When Inquiring about Residence Club Ownership_**

If you have indicated on our web site, in a personal mailing or otherwise that you are interested in receiving information about services and promotions offered by Four Seasons, you may receive information about Four Seasons Residence Clubs. If you contact Four Seasons to request further information about becoming an owner at one or more of our Residence Club properties, we will record your contact information and the list of Residence Club properties about which you would like to receive information.

If the Residence Club is still in sales and Four Seasons is not the sales agent for the Residence Club and at your request, we will send your contact information to the developer of the Residence Club (or its authorized agent). **  **Any information provided to a third party developer directly will be collected, stored and used in compliance with that developer's own privacy policy.

If Four Seasons is the sales agent for the Residence Club, we will forward this information to one or more of our Four Seasons Residence Club Property Sales Specialists, who will contact you to provide you with the information that you requested.  Most of our Residence Club Property Sales Specialists are Four Seasons employees; however, Four Seasons contracts third party agents to act as Sales Associates for a limited number of the Residence Club properties. These third party Sales Associates are contractually bound to protect your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.

**_B. When becoming a Residence Club Owner_**

By the time you are ready to become a Residence Club owner, Four Seasons may already have some of your Personal Information on record from your previous interactions with Four Seasons personnel. If you purchase an interest in a Four Seasons Residence Club property, you will be purchasing directly from a third party real estate developer rather than Four Seasons. In the course of purchasing ownership in a Residence Club property, the third party developer may collect detailed financial information for the purpose of carrying out the transaction. You will need to consult the third party developer's privacy policy to determine their privacy practices. In addition, in the event that Four Seasons helps to arrange financing for your purchase of a Residence Club property, Four Seasons may collect financial information from you. Four Seasons will share this information with the developer, escrow agent, third-party lender, and loan servicing agent for the purpose of carrying-out the purchase transaction. Again, you will need to consult the third party developer to determine their privacy practices. Any financial information Four Seasons retains will be protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy and, where financing is arranged in the United States, under the Financial Services Modernization Act.

**_C. As a Residence Club Owner_**

Once you become a Residence Club owner, Four Seasons as manager of the Residence Club, will use your Personal Information to create an owner profile that is stored in our property management systems. This is used to keep track of your Residence Club account and to provide you with superior service throughout your ongoing relationship with Four Seasons. The information recorded in your Residence Club owner profile includes your name, contact information, certain account and financial information, details about your purchase and ownership and use of other Residence Club properties, as well as your preferences and any special requests.

When you contact the Four Seasons Worldwide Reservations Office (WRO) or the Residence Club property to reserve time at your Residence Club Property, or for any other reason relating to your Residence Club ownership, the Four Seasons staff who speak to you will access your owner profile on our property management systems. The information you provide about your reservation and any additional information, requests or preferences will be recorded in your owner profile. This information will be used to assist us in booking your reservation, providing the services that you desire and to ensure we meet your needs while you are staying at your Residence Club property.

**_D. During your stay at your Residence Club Property_**

During your stay at a Residence Club property, Four Seasons will record information about your use of the property and the related amenities and services offered by the hotel or resort at the property. Four Seasons will use this information for the purposes of billing, and to keep track of reservations of your property by you and other owners. Four Seasons may also record any information you provide about your preferences as well as information about any issues you encountered during your stay (i.e. health issues, payment difficulties, etc.) in order to provide you with superior customer service during your stay and in our ongoing relationship with you as a Residence Club owner. We also record information about your stay to comply with financial reporting requirements, including those imposed by auditors and government regulators. We may also collect certain information as required by local laws (e.g. passport number).

In addition, we may retain the content of any document (including comment cards, electronic documents such as e-mails and other forms of similar communication) that you send us before, during or following your stay. This information may be shared with employees of the Residence Club property or hotel or resort and with Four Seasons.  Finally, in preparation for your stay, we may collect your photograph from publically available sources so that we can recognize you in order to provide you with superior customer service.

**5\. Regarding Private Residence Ownership**

**_A. When inquiring about Private Residence Ownership_**

If you have indicated on our web site, personal mailings or otherwise that you are interested in receiving information about services and promotions offered by Four Seasons, you may receive information about Four Seasons Private Residences. If you contact Four Seasons to request further information about becoming an owner at one of our Private Residences, we will record your contact information.  At your request, the Personal Information you have provided is forwarded to the third party developer of the Private Residences (or its authorized agent), who will contact you to provide you with the information you requested.

Any information provided to a third party developer directly will be collected, stored and used in compliance with that developer's own privacy policy, which is available on the developer's website, and is accessible by clicking the appropriate link in the Private Residences pages on the Four Seasons web site.

**_B. As a Private Residence Owner_**

Once you become a Private Residence owner, Four Seasons as manager of the Private Residences will use your Personal Information to create an owner profile that is stored in our property management systems. This is used to keep track of your account and to provide you with superior service throughout your ongoing relationship with Four Seasons. The information recorded in your Private Residence owner profile includes your name, contact information, credit card number, details about your ownership and use of your Private Residence, as well as your preferences and any special requests.

**_C. During your stay at your Private Residence_**

When you stay at your Private Residence, Four Seasons as manager of the Private Residences, will record information about your use of the amenities and services offered by the neighbouring Four Seasons hotel or resort (if applicable). Four Seasons will use this information for the purposes of billing. Four Seasons may also record any information you provide about your preferences as well as information about any issues you encountered during your stay (i.e. health issues, payment difficulties, etc.) in order to provide you with superior customer service during your stay and in our ongoing relationship with you as a Private Residence owner. We also record information about your stay to comply with financial reporting requirements, including those imposed by our auditors and government regulators. We may also collect certain information as required by local laws (e.g. passport number).

In addition, we may retain the content of any document (including comment cards, electronic documents such as e-mails and other forms of similar communication) that you send us. This information may be shared with employees of the Private Residences or the hotel or resort and with Four Seasons.  Finally, in preparation for your stay, we may collect your photograph from publically available sources so that we can recognize you in order to provide you with superior customer service.
