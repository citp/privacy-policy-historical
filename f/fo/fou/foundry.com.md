personal data. You will, though, always have the right to be informed about the information we

We will investigate any request you make without undue delay and in any event within one month of

into account the complexity and number of requests. We shall inform you of any such extension
within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.
In the event that we decide to not take action on the request, we will inform you of the reasons for
