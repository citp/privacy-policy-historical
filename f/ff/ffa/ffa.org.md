###### National FFA Organization and National FFA Foundation Privacy Policy

The National FFA Organization (the “Organization”) and the National FFA Foundation (the “Foundation”), collectively referred to as “FFA”, are committed to respecting the privacy of FFA members and stakeholders. Our privacy policy governs the collection and use of personal information, whether gathered by our staff, from program participants, from website visitors or through correspondence, and it reflects our approach to gathering and disseminating data. Our policy is to only use data collected for purposes that are integral to furthering the mission of FFA and agricultural education.

###### Who We Are

The National FFA Organization is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization with a mission of developing the potential of students for premier leadership, personal growth and career success through agricultural education. FFA is an integral component of agricultural education at local, state and national levels. The National FFA Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization with a mission of building partnerships with industry, education, government, other foundations and individuals to secure financial resources that fund FFA activities, recognize member achievements, develop student leaders and support the future of agricultural education. Both the Organization and the Foundation collaborate closely with allied organizations within the framework of the National Council for Agricultural Education.

###### Information Collection and Use

Personal information is collected via a number of websites that are either operated by FFA or by authorized vendors. Examples of these websites include, but are not limited to, FFA.org, Shop FFA and online event registration tools for the national FFA convention and the FFA Washington Leadership Conference program.

Personal information collected is utilized for the purpose of transacting business such as merchandise sales, membership services, fulfillment of magazine subscriptions and conduct of programs offered by FFA such as national proficiency awards and American FFA Degrees. Personal information is not shared with third-party entities unaffiliated with the Organization or the Foundation without an individual’s express consent.

###### Email Subscriptions

Recipients of National FFA e-mail messages have the option to unsubscribe from any mailing list or all FFA marketing email. This may be done on the [subscription page](https://www.ffa.org/subscribe/) or via links at the bottom of all FFA marketing email messages. Those who choose to unsubscribe will not receive further email of that type or from the Organization or the Foundation at all if Unsubscribe from all lists is indicated.

###### Coordination with the Educational Community

Strong, supportive relationships between the Organization, Foundation, state FFA associations, state FFA foundations and others in the agricultural education community are critical to our success. Given the importance of these relationships, FFA seeks to remain fully aligned with our stakeholders’ privacy concerns. FFA will only utilize data provided by members and stakeholders to further the educational mission of FFA and agricultural education. In addition, personal information obtained on official FFA membership rosters, registrations and directories, (i.e., roster-derived data) provided by local schools and state associations will only be used for FFA donor campaigns upon written permission from the respective state supervisor of agricultural education for each state in which a donor activity is to be conducted.

**Privacy of Children**

FFA provides additional privacy protections when children visit the website. We do not knowingly collect, maintain or store personal information from or about children under the age of 13 without a parent’s and/or legal guardian’s consent, except in limited circumstances authorized by law and described in this notice. [ _If you are under the age of 18, please read this privacy policy with a parent or legal guardian. If you are under the age of 13, your FFA advisor and the National FFA Organization must have your parent’s or legal guardian’s consent before collecting any personal information._](https://ffatest.ffa.org/coppa/)

Information collected from children consists of membership roster data including name, home address, age, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, birthdate, gender, ethnicity, race, residence type, high school graduation year, grade level and t-shirt size. This information, which may be shared with state associations and local chapters, is used to help students complete applications for awards and recognition, create participation portfolios, deliver the FFA magazine to students’ home addresses and notify students and their parents and/or guardians of opportunities supportive of the educational mission and objectives of FFA. We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the foregoing activities. We do not disclose information collected from children to unaffiliated third parties.

Parents and legal guardians may review personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion or refuse to allow further collection or use of the information.
