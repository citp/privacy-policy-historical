# National FFA Organization - Help

The National FFA Organization (the "Organization") and the National FFA Foundation (the "Foundation") are committed to respecting the privacy of FFA members and stakeholders. Our privacy policy governs the collection and use of personal information, whether gathered by our staff, from program participants, website visitors or through correspondence, and it reflects our approach to gathering and disseminating data. Our policy is to only use data collected for purposes that are integral to furthering the mission of FFA and agricultural education.

### Who We Are  

The National FFA Organization is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization with a mission of developing the potential of students for premier leadership, personal growth and career success through agricultural education. FFA is an integral component of agricultural education at local, state and national levels. The National FFA Foundation is a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization with a mission of building partnerships with industry, education, government, other foundations and individuals to secure financial resources that fund FFA activities, recognize member achievements, develop student leaders and support the future of agricultural education. Both the Organization and the Foundation collaborate closely with allied organizations within the framework of the National Council for Agricultural Education. 

### Information Collection and Use

Personal information is collected via a number of websites that are either operated by the Organization and Foundation or operated by authorized vendors. Examples of these websites include the Agricultural Career Network, Shop FFA and the online event registration tool for the national FFA convention and the FFA Washington Leadership Conference program.

Personal information collected is utilized for the purpose of transacting business such as merchandise sales, membership services, fulfillment of magazine subscriptions and conduct of programs offered by FFA such as national proficiency awards and American FFA Degrees. Personal information is not shared with third-party entities unaffiliated with the Organization or the Foundation without an individual’s express consent.

### Mailing Lists and Electronic Newsletters

Recipients of e-mails and alerts have the option to unsubscribe from any mailing list. This may be done at the Subscription page on FFA.org or within their Agricultural Career Network profile. Those who choose to unsubscribe will not receive further mailings from the National FFA Organization or the National FFA Foundation. Communication preferences for electronic newsletters will be confirmed annually.

### Coordination with the Educational Community

Strong, supportive relationships between the National FFA Organization, National FFA Foundation, state FFA associations, state FFA foundations and others in the agricultural education community are critical to our success. Given the importance of these relationships, the Organization and Foundation seek to remain fully aligned with our stakeholders' privacy concerns. The Organization and the Foundation will only utilize data provided by members and stakeholders to further the educational mission of FFA and agricultural education. In addition, personal information obtained on official FFA membership rosters, registrations and directories provided by local schools and state associations will only be used for Organization or Foundation donor campaigns upon written permission from the respective state supervisor of agricultural education for each state in which a donor activity is to be conducted.

### Privacy of Children

Information collected from children consists of membership roster data including name, home address, age, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, birthdate, gender, ethnicity, race, residence type, high school graduation year, grade level and t-shirt size. This information, which may be shared with state associations and local chapters, is used to help students complete applications for awards and recognition, create participation portfolios, deliver the FFA magazine to students’ home addresses and notify students and their parents and/or guardians of opportunities supportive of the educational mission and objectives of the FFA. We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the foregoing activities. We do not disclose information collected from children to unaffiliated third parties.

Parents and legal guardians may review personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion or refuse to allow further collection or use of the information. To do so, please contact the National FFA Organization, 6060 FFA Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46268, privacy@ffa.org, 317-802-6060.

User data is stored, both physically and electronically, according to the requirements specified by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.
