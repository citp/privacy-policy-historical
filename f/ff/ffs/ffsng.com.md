Updated at November 21, 2016 

This Privacy Policy applies to ffsng.com owned and operated by Datasteam Technologies SA ("we","FFSNG").

  * The email address you used to create a stand alone account or shared through facebook.
  * Your facebook numeric id when facebook is used to connect.
  * Your public IP address which is publicly provided by your Internet Service Provider which may represent your current location.
  * The browser agent string that is sent by your browser to our servers.
  * The type of the device you are using (desktop/mobile).
  * All data generated in the application.



What we do with the information we gather

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

  * Internal record keeping.
  * Notify you about ingame activity.
  * We may use the information to improve our products and services.
  * We may periodically send promotional emails about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided.

Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at support@ffsng.com.

How we protect minors

There are 2 age groups in the game, adults and minors. Users in the same group (adults-adults and minors-minors) can fully communicate with each other. Users in different groups (adults-minors or minors-adults) are not able to lock, raise, wishlist eachother, exchange private messages, gifts, nudges, friend requests and their communication is limited to public only so that it can be screened by our content moderators.

In addition, an adult can not delete his/her messages from a minor's wall. We are also actively monitoring the validity of users' birthdate and we remove users who set a false birthdate without any prior warning since protecting minors is our highest priority.

In short, anything that may create an unattended and permanent connection to a minor is disabled. All these measures (including blocking adult/spammy/unsafe sites/images) along with 24/7 moderation and parental guidance which is required when minors are exploring the internet, make the game a safer place for all.

Passive Collection

This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.
