## SENDING NEXTERA ENERGY ADVERTISEMENTS

We may send out periodic emails informing customers of offers related to a service they requested. Customers will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential service.

While visitors of our sites cannot send any of our posted advertisements via email, visitors can request that we send ads on their behalf. Before we can satisfy any requests, visitors must provide their name and the third party's email address. This information is used to send the specified advertisement.

Customers who do not wish to receive NextEra Energy promotional emails on new products and services may _[click here to notify us](http://app.fpl.com/sowww2/SowwwHtmlController?command=emailPrefUpdate)_.

## CHILDREN MAY NOT USE THE NEXTERA ENERGY SITES

The NextEra Energy Sites are intended to be used by adults only, and not directed towards children under the age of eighteen. If you are under eighteen, you are not eligible to use the NextEra Energy Sites. If you believe that we have collected personal information from children under the age of eighteen, please notify us immediately so that we may take steps to eliminate such information.

## A WARNING ABOUT E-MAIL THAT WE SEND; A WARNING ABOUT “PHISHING”

We may send you emails from time to time to provide you with energy-saving ideas and other useful information, updates regarding our services, and special offers (whether available directly from NextEra Energy or from one or more of our business partners). Likewise, we may from time to time call the phone number associated with your account.

However, we do not and will not at any time request any of the following information via email or through any telephone call initiated by NextEra Energy:

  * your account user ID

  * your account password

  * your social security number

  * your credit card and/or bank information




Likewise, we will never send you an unsolicited email containing a link to the log in page for our website.

If you receive an email or telephone call requesting any of this information, it is likely that you have received an attempted theft of your identity commonly called “phishing.” Likewise, if you receive an email urging you to login to your account and provides you with a link to the login page, it is also likely that you have received a “phishing” attempt. In either case, you should bring the email to the attention of our security department by forwarding the email to: _[http://www.fpl.com/contact](http://www.fpl.com/contact/index.shtml)_

If we send you an email requesting that you login to your account, we strongly recommend that you open your web browser and manually input the address for our website. Doing so will ensure that you do not open some third-party website disguised to look like our website.

For more information about “phishing,” you should visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website at _[www.ftc.gov.](http://www.ftc.gov/)_

## WARNING ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA

In order to provide both current and potential customers with more options for contacting Florida Power & Light Company’s Customer Service department (“FPL”), FPL has established Facebook and Twitter accounts. As these are public forums, you should be aware that any personal information you choose to disclose through those platforms can be read, collected or used by others and that such disclosures are subject solely to the Privacy Policies and protections of those forums. FPL has no control over those forums and, thus, is not responsible for any personal information you may choose to disclose through them. You should also be aware that FPL will never disclose, or ask for you to disclose, your non-public, personally identifying information (such as your Social Security number, bank information, etc.) through these public forums. FPL recommends that you not submit your non-public, personally identifying information through these avenues. If there is a need for such information, FPL will provide you alternative communication methods.
