All information provided by customers using our online forms is kept strictly confidential and secure to prevent unauthorized use of personal information.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets.

<h2>BROWSER SETTINGS</h2>
<p>For more information on Internet browser settings affecting our security features, visit <u><a href="http://www.fpl.com/faqs/content/website_tech/browsers.shtml" target="_blank">Recommended Browser Settings.</a></u></p>
<h2>SENDING NEXTERA ENERGY ADVERTISEMENTS</h2>
<p>We may send out periodic emails informing customers of offers related to a service they requested. Customers will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered an essential service.</p>
<p>While visitors of our sites cannot send any of our posted advertisements via email, visitors can request that we send ads on their behalf. Before we can satisfy any requests, visitors must provide their name and the third party's email address. This information is used to send the specified advertisement.</p>
<p>Customers who do not wish to receive NextEra Energy promotional emails on new products and services may <u><a href="http://app.fpl.com/sowww2/SowwwHtmlController?command=emailPrefUpdate">click here to notify us</a></u>.</p>
<h2>CHILDREN MAY NOT USE THE NEXTERA ENERGY SITES</h2>
<p>The NextEra Energy Sites are intended to be used by adults only, and not directed towards children under the age of eighteen. If you are under eighteen, you are not eligible to use the NextEra Energy Sites. If you believe that we have collected personal information from children under the age of eighteen, please notify us immediately so that we may take steps to eliminate such information.</p>
<h2>A WARNING ABOUT E-MAIL THAT WE SEND; A WARNING ABOUT “PHISHING”</h2>
<p>We may send you emails from time to time to provide you with energy-saving ideas and other useful information, updates regarding our services, and special offers (whether available directly from NextEra Energy or from one or more of our business partners). Likewise, we may from time to time call the phone number associated with your account.</p>
<p>However, we do not and will not at any time request any of the following information via email or through any telephone call initiated by NextEra Energy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>your account user ID</p>
</li>
<li><p>your account password</p>
</li>
<li><p>your social security number</p>
</li>
<li><p>your credit card and/or bank information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, we will never send you an unsolicited email containing a link to the log in page for our website.</p>
<p>If you receive an email or telephone call requesting any of this information, it is likely that you have received an attempted theft of your identity commonly called “phishing.” Likewise, if you receive an email urging you to login to your account and provides you with a link to the login page, it is also likely that you have received a “phishing” attempt. In either case, you should bring the email to the attention of our security department by forwarding the email to: <u><a href="http://www.fpl.com/contact/index.shtml">http://www.fpl.com/contact</a></u></p>
<p>If we send you an email requesting that you login to your account, we strongly recommend that you open your web browser and manually input the address for our website. Doing so will ensure that you do not open some third-party website disguised to look like our website.</p>
<p>For more information about “phishing,” you should visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website at <u><a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">www.ftc.gov.</a></u></p>
<h2>WARNING ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA</h2>
<p>In order to provide both current and potential customers with more options for contacting Florida Power &amp; Light Company’s Customer Service department (“FPL”), FPL has established Facebook and Twitter accounts. As these are public forums, you should be aware that any personal information you choose to disclose through those platforms can be read, collected or used by others and that such disclosures are subject solely to the Privacy Policies and protections of those forums. FPL has no control over those forums and, thus, is not responsible for any personal information you may choose to disclose through them. You should also be aware that FPL will never disclose, or ask for you to disclose, your non-public, personally identifying information (such as your Social Security number, bank information, etc.) through these public forums. FPL recommends that you not submit your non-public, personally identifying information through these avenues. If there is a need for such information, FPL will provide you alternative communication methods.</p>
<h2>EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND CHANGES IN OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p><b><i>This Privacy Policy is effective May 25, 2010.</i></b></p>
<p>We reserve the right to alter or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice to you in order to reflect changes in our online information practices. In an effort to ensure that you receive notice of any changes to the Privacy Policy, we may include a notice on our website. Alternatively, we may send a notice to the email address you provide to us; however, if you do not provide us with an email address, we will not be able to provide you with such notice.</p>
<p>We also recommend that you check back with this web page periodically so that you may be kept informed regarding any changes to the Privacy Policy. You should also visit our <u><a href="http://www.fplgroup.com/contents/legal_notice.shtml">Terms of Use</a></u> in addition to this Privacy Policy each time you visit any one of the NextEra Energy Sites.</p>
