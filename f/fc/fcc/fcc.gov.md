Freedom of Information Act 

The Freedom of Information Act, commonly known as the FOIA, ([5 U.S.C. § 552](https://web.archive.org/fcc-bin/bye?http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/foiastat.htm)), was enacted by Congress in 1966 to give the American public greater access to the Federal Government's records. Congress has since expanded the scope of the FOIA to encompass electronic records. However, you do not have to file a FOIA request to obtain information which is routinely available for public inspection, including records from docketed cases, broadcast applications and related files, petitions for rulemakings, various legal and technical publications, legislative history compilations, etc. _See_ 47 C.F.R. §§ 0.453 and 0.455. Much of this information is available on our website. Visit the [FCC FOIA Home Page](http://www.fcc.gov/foia/) for an informal explanation of the FOIA process at the FCC.

Futher, the FCC seeks to disseminate all its data as broadly and promptly as possible so that the public can benefit from the FCC's work of ensuring vital and innovative communication services are available to all Americans at reasonable prices. In keeping with this commitment, and in accordance with OMB requirements, the FCC has developed Information Quality Guidelines and provides the public the opportunity to [comment](http://www.fcc.gov/omd/dataquality/complaint/) if those guidelines are not followed."
