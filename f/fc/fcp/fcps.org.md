# Privacy Policy | FCPS

## What Information Do We Collect?

We collect information from you when you register on our site, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey or fill out a form.

When registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.

## What Do We Use Your Information For?

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

  * To personalize your experience. Your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs.
  * To improve our website. We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.
  * To send periodic emails. The email address you provide for order processing, will only be used to send you information and updates that you have asked for.



Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

## Do We Use Cookies?

Yes.  Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings. Like most websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of our services may not function properly.

## Do We Disclose Any Information to Outside Parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

## Third Party Links

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third links on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act). We do not request or knowingly collect any personally identifiable contact information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.

## Photo and Video Usage of Student Images

Students may occasionally appear in photographs and videos taken by FCPS staff members, other students, or other individuals authorized by a Building Principal or District Administrator. The District may use these pictures, without identifying the student, in various publications, including but not limited to, the school yearbook, school newspaper, and school website. No consent or notice is needed or will be given before the District uses pictures of unnamed students taken while they are at school or a school-related activity.

Many times, however, the District will want to identify a student in a school picture. District officials may want to acknowledge those students who participate in a school activity or deserve special recognition. In order for the District to publish a picture with a student identified by name in any school-sponsored material, including yearbook, one of the student’s parents or guardians must sign a consent form. Granting consent allows the District to publish and otherwise use photographs and videos, with the child identified, while he or she is enrolled in Frederick County Public Schools. This consent is valid for one year and may be revoked at any time by notifying the student's Building Principal.

## Online Privacy Policy Only

This online privacy policy applies only to information collected through our website and not to information collected offline.
