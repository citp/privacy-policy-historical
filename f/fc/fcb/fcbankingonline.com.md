   FACTS           DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Why?               Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                   consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how
                   we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to
                   understand what we do.
What?              The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you
                   have with us. This information can include:
                     Social Security Number and income
                     account balances and payment history
                     credit history and account transactions
How?               All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday
                   business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their
                   customers’ personal information; the reasons First Commonwealth Financial Corporation
                   chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
