		<h3>FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY FOR CLIENTS</h3>
		<p>The First Commonwealth Financial Corporation (First Commonwealth) family of   companies is committed to safeguarding the information you provide us and this   commitment extends to online banking. While our <strong>Privacy Policy for Clients</strong> is the same whether you   are online or not, we have extra privacy measures in place to protect your   information when you bank online with us. The sections below describe these   extra measures.</p>
		<h4>Cookies</h4>
		<p>First Commonwealth does not automatically collect personal information from   visitors to its Web sites. Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web   site stores on a visitor's Web browser. First Commonwealth uses cookies only in   Internet Banking. Cookies are a requirement for this service so that we can   protect the privacy of your transactions. However, we limit the use of cookies   by establishing a new cookie for each Internet Banking session.</p>
		<p>First Commonwealth does not store confidential or classified information in   cookies. Cookies cannot be used to capture your e-mail address, gain   confidential or classified information about you, or obtain data from the hard   drive of your computer. Some Web sites use cookies to obtain information from   your browser but cookies can only be read by the Web site that set the cookie.   You can control the use of cookies by setting your browser to give you the   opportunity of accepting or rejecting an incoming cookie.</p>
		<h4>Links to Non-First Commonwealth sites</h4>
		<p>First Commonwealth is not responsible for the information collection practices   of the non-First Commonwealth links you click to from our Web pages. We cannot   guarantee how these third parties use cookies or whether they place on your   computer cookies that may identify you personally. First Commonwealth urges you   to review the privacy policies of each of the linked Web sites you visit -   before you provide them with any personally identifiable information.</p>
		<h3>FIRST COMMONWEALTH FINANCIAL CORPORATION PRIVACY POLICY FOR CLIENTS</h3>
		<h4>What you should know</h4>
		<p>We recognize our obligation to keep information about you secure and   confidential. There is some important information we want you to know.</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Unlike many other financial institutions, we do not sell Client Information to   marketers outside First Commonwealth who may want to offer you their own   products and services.</li>
	      <li>We do not control advertising (mail, telephone or e-mail) you receive from   companies outside First Commonwealth. You can reduce outside advertising by   contacting the Direct Marketing Association and the credit reporting bureaus and   by registering on the do not call registry.</li>
	      <li>We carefully manage information among our companies. Understanding your   relationship with First Commonwealth allows us to serve you better and offer you   more convenience and benefits.</li>
      </ol>
		<p>This policy covers Client Information, which means personally identifiable   information about a consumer or a consumer's current or former relationship with   First Commonwealth, including the companies listed under the section First   Commonwealth Companies.</p>
		<p>This policy is provided to you annually as required by the Federal Financial   Privacy Law.</p>
		<p>If you previously exercised your option to limit the sharing of Client Information among First Commonwealth Companies, or limit marketing offers from First Commonwealth Companies, you don't need to take any additional action.</p>
		<h4>Protecting information about you from marketers outside First Commonwealth</h4>
		<p>First Commonwealth does not sell or otherwise share any Client Information with   marketers outside of First Commonwealth who may want to offer you their own   products and services. You do not need to take any action to prevent disclosure   of this information.</p>
		<h4>Making the security of information a priority</h4>
		<p>Keeping financial information secure is one of our most important   responsibilities. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to   protect Client Information. Employees are authorized to access Client   Information only when they have a reasonable business need for the information.   Our employees are required to give confidential treatment to Client Information   and are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to do so.</p>
		<h4>Collecting information</h4>
		<p>We collect and use various types of information to service your accounts, save   you time and money, and better respond to your needs.</p>
		<p>Client Information is categorized as the following four types:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Application Information - information, such as   your assets, income and debt, which you provide to us on applications and   through other means.</li>
	      <li>Transaction and Experience Information -   information about your transactions and account experience, such as your account   balances, payment history, and parties to transactions; or information about our   communications with you, such as requests for copies of checks and our   responses.</li>
	      <li>Consumer Report Information - information from   a consumer report, such as your creditworthiness or credit history.</li>
	      <li>Information from Outside Sources - information   from outside sources regarding their employment, credit and other relationships   with you or verifying representations made by you, such as your employment   history, loan balances and your property insurance.</li>
      </ol>
		<h4>Managing Information</h4>
		<p>We manage how and when information is shared:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Within First Commonwealth</li>
	      <li>With companies that work for us</li>
	      <li>In other situations</li>
      </ul>
		<h4>Managing Information within First Commonwealth</h4>
		<p>First Commonwealth is made up of a number of companies, including financial service providers such as our bank and our insurance agency. Please refer to the   section First Commonwealth Companies for a list of our companies that may   receive or share information about consumer client relationships.</p>
		<p>First Commonwealth may share all four types of Client Information among our companies. For example, if you have an account with one of our companies and   would like to open an account with another of our companies, we may share   information you have provided to us. Sharing this information could save you   time in opening your new account because you might not need to furnish the same   information twice. Sharing information also enhances our ability to protect your   accounts against fraudulent activity on an account. For example, we may use   information about your ATM and debit card transactions to identify any unusual   activity, and then contact you to determine if your card has been lost or   stolen.</p>
		<p>We occasionally receive medical or health information about a client if, for example, a client applies for insurance from us. We do not share medical or   health information among our companies except to maintain accounts, process   transactions, service client requests, or perform insurance functions.</p>
		<h4>Managing Information with companies that work for us</h4>
		<p>We may share any of the four types of Client Information outlined above with companies that work for us. All companies that act on our behalf are   contractually obligated to keep the information we provide to them confidential,   and use the Client Information that we share only to provide the services we ask   them to perform for you and us. These companies may include financial service   providers such as asset management companies, and nonfinancial companies such as   check printing and data processing companies. These companies might assist us,   for example, in fulfilling your service requests and processing your   transactions. In addition, we may share any of the four types of Client   Information with financial institutions with which we have joint marketing   agreements.</p>
		<h4>Managing Information in other situations</h4>
		<p>We may also share any of the four types of Client Information to credit bureaus and similar organizations, and when required or permitted by law. For example,   Client Information may be disclosed in connection with a subpoena or similar   legal process, a fraud investigation, recording mortgages in public records, or   the sale of your account to another financial institution. We may also share any   of the four types of Client Information outside First Commonwealth if we have   your consent, such as when we respond to your service requests.</p>
		<h4>Honoring your preferences</h4>
		<p>You have a choice when it comes to how First Commonwealth shares certain types of Client Information.</p>
		<h4>Sharing among First Commonwealth companies</h4>
		<p>Affiliate sharing: You may request that Application Information, Consumer Report Information and Information from Outside Sources not be shared among First Commonwealth   companies. However, through the normal course of doing business, we will   continue to share Transaction and Experience Information among our companies to   service your accounts and better meet your financial needs.</p>
		<p>Affiliate marketing: Federal law gives you the right to limit some but not all marketing offers from our family of First Commonwealth companies.  Federal law also requires us to give you this notice to tell you about your choice to limit marketing from our affiliates.  You may limit the First Commonwealth companies, such as the bank and insurance agency affiliates, from marketing their products and services to you if you do not have an account or business relationship with them.  These marketing offers are based on your personal information that they receive from other First Commonwealth companies.  This information includes your income, your account history, and your credit score.  Your choice to limit marketing offers from the First Commonwealth companies will apply until you tell us to change your choice.</p>
		<p>If you do not want First Commonwealth to share Application Information, Consumer Report Information and Information from Outside Sources among First Commonwealth companies, or you want First Commonwealth to limit marketing offers, you can tell us that by:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Calling us toll-free at 1.888.711.2265 and using our Convenience Banking Line. You will need a touch-tone phone for this option.</li>
	      <li>Calling us toll-free at 1.800.711.2265 and talking with a Convenience Banking Center representative.</li>
	      <li>Talking to a client representative at your local community office or your client relationship manager.</li>
      </ol>
		<p>Certain information will be requested in order to assure that your preference is honored across all your accounts.</p>
		<p>To help you understand how we record your preference about sharing Client Information, you should know that:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Your preference will be honored among all First Commonwealth Companies</li>
	      <li>You may receive more than one copy of the Privacy Policy. However, once you have told us about your preference, it will remain in effect until you tell us to   change it.</li>
	      <li>If you have joint accounts, we will treat a request by one party to the account as applying to all parties to the account. A preference will apply to accounts   that each joint account holder has in his or her name and any accounts the joint   account holders have with each other.</li>
	      <li>Since some marketing programs may already be in progress, it may take a short time for your preference to be fully effective.</li>
      </ul>
		<h4>Making sure information is accurate</h4>
		<p>Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. We provide you with access to your account information through various means, such   as account statements, Telephone Banking and Internet Banking. If your account   information is incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please call or write us at   the telephone number or address listed on your account statement, bank records,   or other documentation. We will promptly update or correct any erroneous   information. If you have questions or feel that we have not handled information   about you properly, you may contact us and we will investigate your inquiry or   complaint.</p>
		<h4>Keeping up-to-date with our Privacy Policy</h4>
		<p>First Commonwealth will provide notice of our Privacy Policy annually, as long as you maintain an ongoing relationship with us.</p>
		<h4>First Commonwealth Companies</h4>
		<p>The following is a list of the First Commonwealth companies that may receive or share Client Information:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Commonwealth Trust Credit Life Insurance Co.</li>
