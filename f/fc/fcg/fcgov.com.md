# copyright notice and disclaimer - City of Fort Collins, Colorado

The City of Fort Collins is committed to protecting online users' privacy. Protection of personal privacy on the Internet is our responsibility to assure citizen confidence, increase participation in online activities and support effective delivery of services. The purpose of our policy is to inform you about the types of information we gather when you visit our site, how we may use that information, and whether we disclose it to anyone. 

**Information collected for statistical purposes**   
We automatically collect electronically generated information about your visit to our site, such as the date, type of browser used, and technical Internet protocol data. We collect this information about each user session from our user logs, and refer to it in summary form for identifying trends. Our goal in using this type of information is to help us make our site more useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors and the types of technology our visitors use. We do not track or record information about individuals and their visits. 

**How we collect and use personal information**   
If you submit a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, we will only use the personally identifiable information to respond to your request and analyze trends. If necessary, we may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer your question.   
If you subscribe to any of our online subscriptions, your email address is used only to deliver the subscription you opted into. We do not compile information on subscriptions, historical or otherwise, and you have the option to stop future mailings at any time. 

**How we protect your personal information**   
Any personal data you enter on fcgov.com is encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) which encodes the information before your Web browser software sends it to our server. This ensures that the information you send cannot be read by anyone else before it gets to us. 

**How we use "cookies"**   
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that browsers store on your computer. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. We do not store any personal information in cookies. Even if you do not use cookies, you can still access all of the features on our site. 

**What we provide to third parties**   
As a governmental agency, we are governed by public records laws. Any information that we receive through use of our site is subject to the same provisions as information provided on paper. We do not share personal identifying information with any third party without your permission. We disclose only in aggregate form our statistical analyses or demographics of users to third parties. This information is not reported or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not be released to any outside parties unless we are legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings. 

**Control of personal information**   
At any time while accessing our site, any user may decline participation in any activity that asks for information (i.e. survey, e-mail or e-commerce). Your choice not to participate will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature on our site. In online applications that ask for personal information, you have the option of canceling and terminating the application. You also are provided a way to "unsubscribe" to any newsletters, notices, schedules, etc., sent to you by email in our various contact services (listservs). 

**Privacy Policy Changes**   
Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

**Tell us what you think**   
We at the City of Fort Collins welcome your questions and comments about our privacy policy. Please send e-mail to [webmaster](https://web.archive.org/formmail.php?id=62f5f49b60971cc4ce0fb08b95879be2)
