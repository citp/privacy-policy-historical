# Privacy Policy

## Data Protection Act 1998

The FCO processes personal data for the purposes of promoting and protecting internationally the interests of the United Kingdom and its citizens and contributing to a stronger world community. Recipients of the personal data we may hold on you may include other UK Government Departments and public authorities.

## 1\. Registration information

You do not have to register to use the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website, but you do need to register to take part in the discussions and if you want to receive updates about the site.

The registration information we require as mandatory for you to register is: your username (which does not need to be your real name), a password, and e-mail address. This information is stored securely on our database. Until such time as you choose to delete your account, your details are stored so that you do not need to re-register when you come back to the site.

You can change your registration preferences, e-mail address and and login details through the website at any time. If you wish to amend your personal profile, please click on the 'Subscribe' link at the top of the page, log in to your account, and check/uncheck the options available. If you are no longer interested in receiving FCO email alerts and wish to be removed from our database, click on the 'Unsubscribe' link on the same page and simply enter your username and password.

## 2\. Feedback

You can send a message to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office using our Feedback form. If you are asking for information we do not already publish on the site, we will deal with your query. In doing so we may need to contact other Government Departments to find answers to your questions. If your question is technical, we may need to pass it to our technology supplier. In such cases we will only pass on personal data if it is necessary to do so, and we will not keep your personal data or records of our correspondence longer than necessary.

When you send comments to the discussions fora, these can be read by anyone visiting the page. Your registered username appears next to your comments. All comments are read and moderated by editors who may delete them if they break our terms of use.
