# Privacy Policy for the FDA Website

Thank you for visiting the FDA Website. The information we collect about you during your visit depends on what you do while you are on the site.

### Information Automatically Collected and Stored

When you visit any Website, certain personal information about you can be collected automatically. For every visitor, we automatically collect and temporarily store the following information about your computer and your visit:

  * Your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address. (An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you go on the Web.) 
  * The domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or princeton.edu if you are connecting from Princeton University's domain). 
  * The Internet address of the Website, if any, from which you came to our site (for example, www.hhs.gov if you come to the FDA Website by clicking on an FDA link on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' site). 
  * The date and time you arrived at our site and how long you spent on the site. 
  * The name and version of your computer's operating system and browser: for example, Windows 95/Netscape Navigator 4.5. (This information is supplied automatically by your computer.) 
  * Which pages you visited. 



If you just browse through our site, read pages, or download information, that is the only information we collect. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. For example, we use the browser information to help us design our Website so that as many people as possible will be able to view the pages correctly.

### Personal Information You Choose to Provide

We collect and store no other information about you when you visit our site unless you choose to provide it--for example, if you send us an e-mail or fill out a form on our Website and submit it to us.

  * If you send us an e-mail (for example, through the Contact Us button on the FDA Home Page), we do not automatically receive your e-mail address. Of course, you'll need to provide it to us if you would like an e-mail response. And there is no other personally identifying information that we receive with your e-mail unless you choose to provide it. 
  * Likewise, if you fill out one of the forms on our Website (for example, the Adverse Reaction Reporting form) and submit it to us, we will receive only the personal information that you include in the form. 



### Disclosure

FDA does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or by statute. We will only use personally identifying information to respond to you or to help us perform our public health duties. In those cases, various people may see the personal information you provide in order to look into the matter you inquired about.

If enough questions or comments come in that are the same, your question (but not your name) may be added to our Questions and Answers section. We use your suggestions to help us improve the design and content of our Website.

We may enter the information you send into an electronic database, to share with our attorneys and investigators involved in law enforcement or policy-making. We may also share it with other government agencies that have public health or consumer protection duties. FDA or any of those agencies may contact you. In other limited circumstances, including requests from Congress or private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit.

Also, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. If you are worried because your communication is very sensitive, or includes personal information such as your social security number, you can send it by postal mail instead.

### Intrusion Detection

Finally, this site is maintained by the U.S. Government and is thus protected by various provisions of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal prosecution in federal court. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.

If you have any questions or comments about privacy and the FDA Website, please let us know by calling us at 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332), sending us a fax at 301-827-1682, writing to us at: FDA (HFI-50), Rockville, MD 20857, or using our [on-line comment form](https://web.archive.org/web/20030602013500id_/http%3A//www.fda.gov/comments/webform.html).

Thank you.
