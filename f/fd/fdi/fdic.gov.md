# FDIC: Privacy Policy Statement

The FDIC is strongly committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site. The information the FDIC receives depends upon your actions when visiting the Corporation’s web site. 

The FDIC automatically collects and stores the following information about you when you visit our Web site: 

Some parts of the FDIC Web site may use a "cookie", which is a file placed on your computer hard drive, that allows the FDIC web server to log the pages you use in the FDIC site and to determine if you have visited the site before. The cookie captures no personally identifying information. The FDIC server uses this information to provide certain features during your visit to the Web site. You can set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested, and decide whether or not to accept it. By rejecting a cookie some of the features available on the site may not function properly. 

Other than the automatic data collection described above, this site collects no personally identifying information. **The sole exception is when you knowingly and voluntarily provide information** , such as when you fill in your name and address on the FOIA request form. 

The FDIC uses the information we collect for internal system administrative purposes to measure the volume of requests for specific web site pages, and to continually improve the FDIC Internet site to be responsive to the needs of users. Your choice to use the FDIC Web site or to send electronic mail to FDIC will be considered your consent for the FDIC to use the information collected therefrom as stated in this notice.

  
**Intrusion Detection Monitoring**

This government computer system employs software security programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Such attempts are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. 

  
**Information Collected From You**

You may decide to send the FDIC information, including personally identifying information. The information you supply – whether through a secure Web form, a standard Web form, or by sending an electronic mail message – is maintained by the FDIC for the purpose of processing your request or inquiry. The FDIC also uses the information you supply in other ways to further the FDIC’s mission of maintaining stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system. 

Various employees of the FDIC may see the information you submit in the course of their official duties. The information may also be shared by the FDIC with third parties to advance the purpose for which you provide the information, including other federal or state government agencies. For example, if you file a complaint, it may be sent to a financial institution for action, or information may be supplied to the Department of Justice in the event it appears that federal criminal statutes have been violated by an entity you are reporting to the FDIC. The primary use of personally identifying information will be to enable the government to contact you in the event we have questions regarding the information you have reported. 

Under certain circumstances, the FDIC may be required by law to disclose information you submit to the Corporation, for example, to respond to a Congressional inquiry or subpoena. 

If you register with an FDIC online mailing list, the information you provide may also be used to send you FDIC communiqués or notify you about updates to our web site. 

When you choose to send e-mail to the FDIC you are consenting to the FDIC using the information provided therein, including personally identifying information, in accordance with this notice, unless you expressly state in the e-mail your objection to any use(s). 

As required by federal law, Privacy Act statements are located throughout this web site where the FDIC requests information from you.
