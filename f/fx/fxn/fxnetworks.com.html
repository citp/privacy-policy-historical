<p id="introduction"><strong>1.	INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>FX Networks, LLC ("FX" or "we"), which operates the FXNetworks.com website, has developed this Privacy Policy to describe how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy applies to the entertainment-related websites, mobile sites, applications ("apps"), widgets, and other content and services that are linked to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "FX Sites").    
By providing personal information to us and using the FX Sites, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.  FX is part of the United States based operations of News Corporation.  To see a list of our affiliated companies ("FX Affiliates") <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p>As set forth in our Terms of Use, the FX Sites are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both those who use some of the FX Sites without being registered for an FX Site and those who have registered for one or more FX Sites.  This Privacy Policy applies to FX's collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or email address).  It also describes generally FX's practices for handling non-personal information (e.g., interests, demographics and services usage).</p>

<p id="information"><strong>2.	COLLECTION OF INFORMATION </strong></p>
<p>Some of the information collected may be personal information and some may not identify you as a specific person. </p>
<p>Registration Information is the information required to register for our FX Sites, for example to create an FX account, post comments, receive a newsletter or mobile alert, or enter a contest or sweepstakes (collectively, the "Registration Information").  Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, zip code, birthday, and phone number. </p>
<p>Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the FX Sites and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture. Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines. </p>
<p>Social Media Information and Content.  If you access an FX Site through another website, app, service or log-in ("Other Service"), or connect an FX Site to Other Services, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that Other Service, any information or content you have permitted the Other Service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends' lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that Other Service (collectively, "Social Media Information and Content").  When you access the FX Sites through Other Services, or when you connect an FX Site to Other Services, you are authorizing FX to collect, store, and use any and all Social Media Information and Content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Site Activity Information.  When you access and interact with the FX Sites, we and our service providers may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the FX Sites, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the FX Sites from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device, geolocation data, or other transactional information for that device in order to provide the FX Sites to it.</p>
<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier, may also be used.  Websites, apps, and services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website.  These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the FX Sites, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.</p>
<p id="advertising-choices">Third parties that support the FX Sites by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate FX Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.  FX does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.  For more information about third party ad networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/consumers</a>, and to opt-out of such ad networks' and services' advertising practices, go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.  </p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Block-or-allow-cookies).  Users can manage the use of Flash technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html</a>.  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or personalization available through the FX Sites.</p>
<p>Information from Other Sources.  To improve the quality of the FX Sites, we and our service providers may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources such as publicly available information from social media services and commercially available sources.</p>

<p id="notice"><strong>3. NOTICE AND CHOICE</strong></p>
<p>Means of Notice and Choice.  This Privacy Policy is the primary means by which FX provides you with notice and choice regarding its collection and use of your personal information.  FX will not use your personal information in a manner that is new or unexpected without giving you a choice. </p>
<p>Updates to Privacy Policy.  FX may modify this Privacy Policy.  Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the FX Sites.  If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that expand our rights to use the personal information we have already collected from you, we will notify you and provide you with a choice about our future use of that information.</p>
<p>Location of Data Storage.  The FX Sites are hosted in and managed out of the United States. If you are a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any personal information processed in the United States. United States data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction.  This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above.  As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.</p>
<p>Linked Services.  The FX Sites may also be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies.  FX is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the FX Sites via a link, enable an unaffiliated service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the unaffiliated service.  </p>
<p>Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service.  In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or make payments ("Payment Service").  If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage.  Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service's use of information collected through any Payment Service. </p>

<p id="disclosure"><strong>4.	USE AND DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
<p>We use the personal information and other information we collect from and about you for the following purposes:</p>
<p>To provide and manage the FX Sites. We use the information we collect from and about you to provide the FX Sites and features to you, including to measure and improve those FX Sites and features, to personalize your experience by delivering relevant content, advertising and marketing messages, to allow you to comment on content, participate in online games, contests, or rewards programs, to provide you with customer support, and to respond to inquiries.  We may also use aggregate or anonymous data about your use of and activity on the FX Sites to assist us in this regard. </p>
<p>To allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the FX Sites.  FX may make your information available to certain third party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide the FX Sites.  These service providers are required to protect the personal information entrusted to them and not use it for any purpose other than the specific service they are providing to you and FX.</p>
<p>To allow social sharing functionality.  In some cases, we may allow you to log-in with or connect your social media account with your FX account. If you log-in with or connect your social media account with an FX Site, we will share your social media user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other FX Sites' users and with your friends associated with your social media account.  We will also share the same information with your social media account provider.  By logging-in with or connecting your FX Sites account and your social media account, you are authorizing us to share information with your social media account provider, other users and your friends, and you understand that the use of the shared information will be governed by the social media site's privacy policy.  If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media account with your FX Sites account and do not participate in social sharing on the FX Sites.</p>
<p>To deliver relevant advertisements.   We and our service providers may use the information you provide to us, information we and our service providers collect about your use of the FX Sites, and information that our service providers collect from your use of other websites and services through cookies and other technologies, to assist us in delivering you relevant ads when you visit the FX Sites or Other Services.  As noted above, these third party advertising networks and advertisers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and activity to assist them in delivering advertising that is more relevant to your interests.  To find out more about third party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a>, and to opt out of such advertising networks' and services' advertising practices, go to  <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
<p>To contact you. FX may periodically send promotional materials (e.g., newsletters) or notifications related to the FX Sites to the email address you provided to us at registration or for your account.  If you want to stop receiving promotional materials from an FX Site, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email, send an email to <a href="mailto:FX.Privacy@fox.com">FX.Privacy@fox.com</a> or manage your email preferences in your profile settings. There are certain service notification emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to the FX Sites or policies. </p>
<p>To share with our Affiliates.  FX may share your information with FX Affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  A link to a website that lists FX Affiliates can be found at the beginning of this policy.  Users who visit FX Affiliates' services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>To share with business partners.  FX may share your information with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications, consistent with your choices.  </p>
<p>To protect the rights of FX and our users.  There may be instances when FX may disclose your information without providing notice or choice, including situations where FX has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of FX, our FX Affiliates or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the FX Sites or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.</p>
<p>To complete a merger or sale of assets.  If FX sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, FX may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</p>
<p>When the information collected from or about you does not identify you as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties.  In some instances, we may combine that information with personal information, such as combining your zip code with your name.  If we combine this information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information as long as it is combined.</p>

<p id="security"><strong>5.	SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>FX uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.  However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information.</p>

<p id="control"><strong>6.	USER CONTROL</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise limit our use of your personal information you have previously provided directly to us, you may contact us using the mechanisms provided below. In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your personal information suppressed from our database, or if you have other questions about your personal information.  We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>You may request that we not share your personal information on a going-forward basis with FX Affiliates or unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes by sending an email to <a href="mailto:FX.californiaprivacy@fox.com">FX.californiaprivacy@fox.com</a>, with "Disclosure Opt-out" in the subject line and your full name, email address, and postal address in the body of the email.  We will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>  

<p id="data"><strong>7.	DATA RETENTION</strong></p>
<p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.  
Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with Other Services.</p>
<p>We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.  Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines.</p>

<p id="sensitive"><strong>8.	SENSITIVE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the FX Sites or otherwise.</p>

<p id="contact"><strong>9.	CONTACT US</strong></p>
