  <p><b><u>FX NETWORKS, LLC PRIVACY POLICY</u></b> <br>
    <br>
    FX Networks, LLC (“FX”) is part of the News America Group, which 
    has adopted a set of Privacy Principles applicable to all its U.S.-based companies 
    (available at <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html">http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html</a>). 
    FX has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes 
    how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information (“PII”) 
    we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. <br>
    <br>
    From time to time FX may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives 
    or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features 
    of our Web sites or technology. Therefore, you should review it periodically 
    so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.<br>
    <br>
    <u>COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (“PII”) 
    BY FX</u><br>
    <br>
    <u>General.</u> FX collects personally identifiable information (“PII” 
    -- that is, information such as your full name, email address, mailing address 
    or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our relationship with 
    you. When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting 
    the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, 
    contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in connection 
    with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or 
    because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. 
    On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable 
    sources of such information.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Cookies</u>. Cookies are small bits of information that the Internet sites 
    operated by FX place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember 
    information about your activities on our site(s) and enable FX to make your 
    visits to our site(s) more enjoyable. For example, cookies can store your 
    password for easy logon to a site you have previously visited, can save your 
    preferences for a personalized home page or can track the items you have placed 
    in your “shopping cart” during a visit to our online store. The 
    cookie itself does not contain PII, and FX does not combine cookies or similar 
    tools with PII.<br>
    <br>
    Third party advertisements displayed on Internet site(s) operated by FX may 
    also contain cookies. FX does not control these advertiser cookies and visitors 
    to our Web site(s) should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see 
    whether and how it uses cookies. See the “Notice” section below 
    for more information on third party advertisements.<br>
    <br>
    On occasion, FX may use cookies or similar tools to relate your use of our 
    Web site(s) to personally identifiable information obtained from you or a 
    reputable third party. For example, if you’ve asked us to send you information 
    about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or other information 
    about your online activities may allow us to limit the materials we send you 
    to items we know you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities 
    and preferences. However, if FX wishes to coordinate your personal and Web 
    site activity information in this manner, we will obtain your express prior 
    consent (i.e., “opt in”).</p>
  <p>You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent 
    or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you may not have 
    access to certain features on FX’s Web site(s), such as FX Behind The 
    Scenes.<br>
    <br>
    <u>NOTICE: FX WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</u><br>
    When FX collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who 
    is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected 
    and the types of uses FX will make of the information.</p>
  <p> This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send 
    you information about their products and services and therefore may want to 
    share your personal information (See “Use” below). However, FX 
    will notify you of your options regarding our use of your personally identifiable 
    information, including whether we can share it with outside companies, before 
    we use it for a purpose other than the one for which it was originally collected 
    or disclose it to third parties, typically at the time of collection (See 
    “Choice” below).</p>
  <p> Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers 
    in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed 
    notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead 
    be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text 
    of this Policy and other relevant information from us.</p>
  <p> FX ’s Web site(s) may be linked to Internet sites operated by other 
    companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with an FX logo, 
    even though they are not operated or maintained by FX (for example, the NASCAR 
    Family Chat Super Site). FX’s Web site(s) also carry advertisements 
    from other companies as well as advertisements placed by national Internet 
    ad agencies. Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, 
    FX is not responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third 
    parties that are linked to our site[s] or for the privacy practices of third 
    party or so-called national internet advertising companies. Once you’ve 
    left an FX site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should 
    check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site 
    to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.</p>
  <p> Some of the advertisements that appear on FX’s Web site(s) are delivered 
    to you by national Internet advertising companies such as Doubleclick or 24/7Real 
    Media. These companies may utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements 
    and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit 
    to our site[s], including information about the banner ads they display, any 
    cookie they place on your computer and your IP address. To opt out of information 
    collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies 
    they use or their own privacy policies, please visit their Web sites by clicking 
    on their respective banners.</p>
  <p> FX’s Web site(s) may also be linked to sites operated by companies 
    affiliated with FX. Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer 
    to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some 
    respects from this Policy.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>CHOICE: FX WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII</u></p>
  <p> FX will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may 
    be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted. 
    You will also be able to choose whether your information is shared with companies 
    that are not affiliated with FX (i.e., not part of the News America Group).<br>
  </p>
  <p> <u>USE: FX’S USE OF PII</u></p>
  <p> FX will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and 
    only for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other uses are disclosed 
    and you allow us to use your information in these other ways.<br>
    <br>
    FX may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, 
    are part of the News America Group of companies. FX may also share your PII 
    with companies that are not affiliated with FX, but would like to send you 
    information about their products and services. For example, some of the companies 
    who supply prizes for FX’s contests may have special offers or promotions 
    that might be of interest to FX viewers. However, you will always have the 
    opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties.</p>
  <p> FX employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason 
    to obtain access to your PII. Outside contractors or agents who help us manage 
    our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, 
    statistical analyses) may only use PII to provide FX with a specific service 
    and not for any other purpose.</p>
  <p> If FX obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use 
    of this information is governed by this Policy.</p>
  <p> There may be instances when FX may disclose PII without providing you with 
    a choice in order to protect the legal rights of FX, other companies within 
    the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect 
    the safety and security of visitors to our Web sites; to protect against fraud 
    or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. 
    In addition, if FX sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer 
    of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, FX may 
    transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.</p>
  <p><br>
    <u>SECURITY: FX PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII</u></p>
  <p> FX uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures 
    to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, 
    disclosure or modification. In addition, FX uses reasonable methods to make 
    sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.<br>
  </p>
  <p> <u>ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII</u></p>
  <p> In most cases, FX will retain PII for ninety (90) days or less. In the event 
    PII is retained for longer, FX has implemented a procedure for you to access, 
    correct or delete your PII.</p>
  <p> To access your PII, send an e-mail with the word “Privacy” in 
    the subject line to Privacy@FoxCable.com, or a write to the FX Internet Privacy 
    Officer at FX Networks, LLC, 10000 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 
    90067, requesting a listing of the PII that is on file for you. FX will respond 
    no later than fifteen (15) business days from receipt of your request with 
    a list of the PII on file. There may be certain instances when FX may not 
    be able to provide the PII, such as when access would violate the privacy 
    of another individual, when access is prohibited by law, or when the PII has 
    been lawfully obtained from third party sources.</p>
  <p> In the event the PII on file is incorrect, you may correct the PII by sending 
    a written request for correction to the FX Internet Privacy Officer at FX 
    Networks, LLC, 10000 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90067, 
    including all of the incorrect PII, the PII that you wish to change, and your 
    signature authorizing such changes. FX will then correct the PII in its database 
    and send a written confirmation to you within fifteen (15) business days.</p>
  <p> If for any reason you wish to stop all future communications from FX, you 
    may send an e-mail with the word “Privacy” in the subject line 
    to Privacy@FoxCable.com, or a write to the FX Internet Privacy Officer at 
    FX Networks, LLC, 10000 Santa Monica Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90067, 
    requesting that your PII be permanently removed form any FX database. FX will 
    send a written confirmation of such removal to you within fifteen (15) business 
    days of receipt of your request. E-mails sent to Privacy@FoxCable.com for 
    purposes other than communication about PII may not be acknowledged or responded 
    to.</p>

    the collection and use of PII, you may contact the following FX representative.:</p>
