**Background** **Affiliation Status Information Center** **(BASIC)** One of the first things any investor should do before trading in FX products is conduct a background check on the firms and individuals offering these products. It is also a very good idea to routinely perform a background check on the firms and individuals offering these products. National Futures Association ("NFA") maintains a database of futures-related information, including Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") registration information, NFA membership information, regulatory actions and information concerning certain types of customer claims. The CFTC registration and NFA membership information provided in the system called Background affiliation Status Information System, or "BASIC" includes the current and historical CFTC registration and NFA membership statuses of individuals and firms. The regulatory information available in BASIC includes actions taken by NFA's Committees, by the CFTC and by U.S. futures exchanges.

Using NFA's Background Affiliation Status Information Center (BASIC), investors can quickly and easily check the registration status and disciplinary history of every firm and individual conducting FX business with the retail public. To access the BASIC system, you can do so by going to <http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet>
