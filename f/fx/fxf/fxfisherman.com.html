<h2>Privacy Policy Statement</h2><div class="box">
<p>This Privacy Policy Statement describes how the FxFisherman.com handles personal information that it receives through this web site. Throughout this Statement, “we” and “us” refer to the FxFisherman.com.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>  <h3>Registration</h3> <p>Registration is not necessary for the public to use this Web site. However, members must register in order to gain access to the “members only” portion of the Web site and to subscribe to specific working groups. During registration, you must complete the registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give us contact information. We use this information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.</p>  <p>The FxFisherman.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site.</p>  <h3>Member Billing</h3> In connection with applications for membership and membership billing, we collect contact information and financial information. We use this information for billing purposes and to process your membership application. If we have trouble processing your application or your billing instructions, we will use this information to contact you.  <h3>Controlled Materials</h3> In certain instances, you may only obtain materials or information from this Web site if you provide contact information and other personally identifiable information. We use this information to identify who is receiving these materials and how they are being used.  <h2>Communications from the Web Site</h2>  <h3>Generally</h3> We use the personally identifiable information we receive to provide member services to you by, for example, setting up working group subscriptions that you select, delivering member newsletters to you, and providing you with information about developments and events that we believe will be of interest to our members. You may subscribe or unsubscribe from each group at any time in order to control your receipt of working group communications. You may not unsubscribe from “all-members” communications as we use this channel of communication to provide information and materials that are necessary for membership.  <h3>Customer Service</h3> Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.
