providers, including IT and software providers and vendors. We may also share your personal data with third
persons and authorities if required by law, in respond to legal process, to protect our clients, to maintain the
security of our services and to protect the rights or property of the Firm.
We do not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal data to any third party for any reason,
except as described below.
We reserve the right to disclose your personal data to third parties when required to do so by law to regulatory,
law enforcement or other government authorities. We may also disclose your information as necessary to
credit reporting or collection agencies. We may also disclose your information to non-affiliated third parties if
it is necessary to protect our rights or property.
We share your personal data with the banks and payment institutions, which process your payments to / from
us. Commonly, we share your name, address, contact details (email) and the amount of payment to / from
you. Such disclosure is made solely to provide you with an ability to deposit withdraw funds to / from us.

positions with external liquidity providers they may access the information regarding your trading orders,

Your personal data may be shared with our software vendors and IT services providers including trading
platform providers (hereinafter – “IT vendors”). While providing the Company with software, modifications,
implementation and support IT vendors may have access to our information systems from their systems and
locations.
As a result, some of your personal data depending on the system where they are kept may be disclosed to
our IT vendors. We limit an access of such IT vendors to our information systems to the best of our abilities
however, the situation may arise that in the process of software maintenance (modification of software
functionality, migrating data to the new software versions, fixing bugs etc.) the vendor and/or IT provider get
an access to the databases where your personal data is stored.
Some of IT vendors act as our technology providers based on the software-as-a-service (SAAS) business
model. In this case, we use their information systems installed on their hardware environment. Respectively,
our databases may be kept on the servers of such vendors. In this case, we limit an access of the IT vendors
by the mean of integrated management rules, which prevent a vendor from accessing the data kept by its
clients.
To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us to carry out certain
internal functions such as account processing, client service and support, client satisfaction surveys or other


data collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a party with customer information
from our database to help us to analyse and identify customer’s needs and notify customers of product and
service offerings. Use of the shared information is strictly limited to the performance of the task we request
and for no other purpose.
According to the applicable legislation we are required to upload your trading data (trading orders and / or
positions) along with some of your personal data (name and / or UID) to the trading data depositories. We
enter into agreements with the well-known international depositories, which could provide a highest level of
data security.
We may share information with affiliates and partners, if the information is required to provide the product or
service you have requested, or to provide you with the opportunity to participate in the products or services
our affiliates and partners offer.
We may also forge partnerships and alliances, which may include joint marketing agreements, with other
companies who offer high-quality products and services that might be of value to our customers. To ensure
that these products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant,
we may share some information with partners, affiliates and alliances. This allows them to better understand
the offers that are most relevant and useful to yourself. The use of your personal information is limited to the
purposes identified in our relationship with the partner or affiliate.

and protections.
