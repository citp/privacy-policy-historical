			re-enter registration information that you have already provided. Cookies are not linked to
			any personally identifiable information. If you simply want to browse, you do not have to
			accept cookies from any of our sites. However, if you wish to log in as a member, or to

			service you own.</li>
			<li><b>Verify your credit worthiness for purchases:</b> Before providing goods or services
			requiring payment, we must verify that the credit card you are using is valid and authorized

			information with partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that
