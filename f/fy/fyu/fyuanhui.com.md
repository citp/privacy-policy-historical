##  What information is collected and how is it used?

###  Information You Directly Provide through our Services

We collect personal information directly from you when you visit our Services to do all the things typically associated with online services. Examples of the personal information we collect include name, address, phone number, email address, personal preferences, payment card number, purchase and ordering information, demographic information, responses to survey questions, sizing information and any other information you choose to provide.  Our Services may also give you the option to upload or share pictures or videos of yourself and others.

This information is collected at various places on our Services: for instance, when you check out with your online order; engage with our mobile applications; subscribe to catalogs, email offers, and mobile messaging offers; participate in surveys; join fyuanhui's Secret YOUBAIS; enter contests or sweepstakes; or interact with special-event or program offers.

We may also collect information that you provide on our Services about people you know. For example, we collect your gift recipient's contact information to process your gift orders. We may also collect contact information about your friends and family members when you participate in one of our refer-a-friend programs. In these instances, we may send a message to your friend or family member on your behalf. Please ensure that you only submit email addresses of individuals with whom you have a personal or family relationship and who would want to receive the message from you.

We use personal information about you collected on the Services to do things like:

    1. process your online orders;

    2. open an online account at your request;

    3. personalize your online experience with content and offers that are tailored to your interests;

    4. provide customer service, whether it's responding to a request or following up on an order;

    5. include you in surveys and contests;

    6. enable you to post your content, such as comments, images or videos;

    7. facilitate networks of online social activity centered around our products and services;

    8. improve our Services, the manner in which offers are made on our Services, the purchase decisions of our visitors, and the interactions visitors have with our Services;

    9. enable you to interact with third-party content service providers, whether by linking to their sites, viewing their content within our online environment, or by viewing our content within their online environment; and

    10. market our products and services that may be of interest to you--for instance, we may add you to the fyuanhui's Secret and fyuanhui's Secret Pink email list when you make an online purchase or sign up to receive emails; or we may add you to fyuanhui's Secret print-catalogue list when you make an online purchase or to the YOUBAIS email list if you sign up for YOUBAIS.

 **Information We Observe or Collect through Technology**

####  Location Information

We may collect information about your location when you access or use our Services.  For more details, please see "What choices do you have over how your information is used?" below.

####   Navigational Information

When you access our Services, we may collect navigational information, such as browser type and version, service-provider identification,IPaddress, the site or online service from which you came, and the site or online service to which you navigate.

####   Device Information

We collect information about the computer or mobile device used to access our Services, such as the hardware model, operating system and version, identification numbers assigned to your mobile device, such as the ID for Advertising (IDFA) on Apple devices, and the Advertising ID on Android devices, mobile network information, and website or app usage behavior.

####   Cookies, Clear Gifs and Similar Technologies

To better understand how you interact with our Services, we may collect information using cookies, clear-gifs (also known as web beacons or web bugs) and similar technologies.

A cookie is a small amount of data that's stored by your browser on your device. It's used to do things like see how you navigate our Services, what you click on, and remember you and your online purchases when you return. This helps us improve our Services, provide better customer service, tailor your online experience, and tailor offers to you based on your unique tastes and both your online and offline (e.g., in-store) interactions and purchase history.

A clear gif is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a web page, web-based document or e-mail message. It helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the clear gif appears and the time the site, document or email in question is viewed. Clear gifs in e-mails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family; and they help deliver a more personalized online experience.

In addition to cookies and clear gifs, we may also use device identifiers, web storage and other technologies to collect information about your interactions with our content and Services.

The above technologies may be used to help us see which of our interactive experiences online users like most for example, by keeping track of the number of times a video, widget or other media is accessed or embedded on social networking sites; and on which social networking sites it is embedded, based on inquiries that are sent to our Services. Cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies also allow us to associate your online navigational information, or purchases and interactions (both online and offline), with any personal information you provide (such as name, address, phone number, survey responses, and email address). We'll associate this information to deliver products and services to you; to improve our business; to transact business; and to market our products and services on this and other online services and through a variety of media like email, mobile advertising, and direct mail. As an example, we may use cookies to keep track of what you put into your shopping bag. That can help us contact you if your online session is disrupted in mid-purchase, resulting in an abandoned cart. We can also use this technology to determine whether you'd be interested in participating in special events, given your preferences. The end result is a more personalized experience that's tailored to your needs and tastes.

For information about your options with respect to cookies, see "What choices do you have over how your information is used?" below.

We don't endorse or generally have any affiliation with these third parties. And we don't control and aren't responsible for their practices. It is possible that the third party providing content through our Services may collect or observe information through its use of technology.
