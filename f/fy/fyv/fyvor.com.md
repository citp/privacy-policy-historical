# Privacy Policy - Fyvor.com

#### Privacy Statement

Fyvor is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our offerings. This policy may change from time to time so please check back periodically. This Privacy Statement only covers the site Fyvor.

#### Aggregated Information

Aggregated information, such as which page users access or visit, and information volunteered by users is collected through various methods. For example, Fyvor collects IP addresses; an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers (the computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address; when you request a page from Fyvor, our servers log your IP address. 

Fyvor only uses IP addresses for the purposes of Web traffic analysis and trends.

#### Use of Information

We utilize the information we collect about our users to learn more about how they interact with our Services to customize the Services to their interests and enhance the user experience. Other websites that may be accessible through links from our Services may have their own privacy statements and personal information collection, use, and disclosure practices. Our merchants and business partners also have their own privacy statements, too. Fyvor undertakes to work with third parties who protect and respect your privacy.
