      We at FYE have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to individual privacy. The following discloses our information - gathering and dissemination practices for this site.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Personal Info &amp; Its Use</b><br>
      FYE uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their e-mail address), unique identifiers (like a password), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We do not market this information to any outside companies. In some instances, we may share some of this information with certain Marketing Partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor, when necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the <a href="#delete" class="standardurl">Opt Out</a> section below.<br>
      <br>
      Financial information that is collected is used to check the FYE Partners' qualifications for registration and to bill customers for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as Social Security numbers or tax ID numbers) are collected to be used only in the reporting of income tax when the FYE Partner may have received in excess of $600.00 during a fiscal year. (This amount is subject to change by the Federal Government of the United States.) This information may differ for residents of other nations. Demographic and profile data may also be collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitors' experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in and displaying the content according to their preferences. This is designed to enhance the shopping experience.<br>
      <br>
      Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitors' contact information (like their e-mail address), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). We may also collect demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).<br>
      <br>
      At times, FYE may conduct user surveys. When we do, we gather that information in order to help evolve our business model. At no time do we sell any personal information, but we may share that information with Business Partners.<br>
      <br>
      We may, at times, use the demographic information we gathered as a marketing or promotional tool. When we do that, we will make sure it remains entirely anonymous.<br>
      <br>
      From time-to-time, FYE may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our FYE and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings. See the <a href="#delete" class="standardurl">Opt Out</a> section below.<br>
      <br>
      FYE also allows any customer to create an account with FYE. This allows the user to simplify his or her purchase process at any FYE site.  All the information that a customer may supply when creating an account will be held in the strictest confidence. It will be used simply to manage the payment of orders and the shipping of same by us or by third party marketing partners with whom you have elected to do business. FYE does not share any private financial information about its customers with any outside company or agency unless required by law. We may share other information with marketing partners.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="delete"></a>
      <b>Opt Out</b><br>
      Our site provides users the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. However, please understand that even if you have previously opted out, but later consent to sharing your information by accepting a third party’s marketing offer, we will share your contact and billing information with that specific third party.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Links</b><br>
      Pages at FYE contain links to other sites. FYE is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Security</b><br>

      Our #1 priority is making sure you can shop safely in our store.  Our <b>Secure Shopper Guarantee</b> means you don't have to worry about the safety of your credit card information.<br>
      <br>
      The <b>FYE Secure Shopper Guarantee</b> protects you against unauthorized charges on your credit card. If your credit card company holds you liable for any unauthorized charges to your account resulting from your online purchases on this web site, your liability will be covered up to $50.  By federal law, your credit card company will protect you against unauthorized purchases over $50.  In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card company in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.<br>
      <br>
      When you place an order in this store, FYE protects your credit card number and personal information by encrypting it.  Encryption scrambles your credit card number and personal information.  It stays scrambled while traveling over the Net and remains scrambled even while stored on FYE's machines.  For secure commerce transactions, FYE uses secure server software (SSL), the industry standard and among the best software available today.<br>

If you find that you need to <a href="/helpcenter.htm?file=help_returnitem" target="middle" class="standardurl">return an item</a>, please review the complete details of our return policy below to determine if any special return conditions apply.<br>
          <br>
          Items may be returned within 30 days of the ship date for a refund. If you would like to replace the item you have returned, please place a new order. While most items are returnable, they are subject to the following guidelines:<br>
          <br>
          <b>Defective, Damaged or Misshipped Items</b><br>
          <br>
          You will receive a refund for the item(s) and shipping and handling costs for defective, damaged or misshipped items. For all other items, shipping and handling costs cannot be refunded.  (Note:  Return shipping cost refunds are calculated using the lowest cost shipping method.  Items returned via expedited shipping methods will only be refunded an amount equal to the lowest cost shipping method).<br>
          <br>
          <b>Proper Conditions for Return and Credit</b><br>
          <br>
          Returned merchandise must be in new condition with its original packing and accessories intact or it may be subject to a restocking fee.  If you are returning a product listed below, please check to make sure your return meets the conditions described.
          <ul>
            <li>CDs, DVDs, VHS tapes, phone cards, computer software, printer cartridges, video games, storage media and memory (including desktop, notebook and digital camera memory) - Must be unopened.
              </li><li>Books - Must be in their original condition.
              </li><li>Perishables and personal care items (including earrings) - May not be returned, unless defective or misshipped.
              </li><li>No personalized items may be returned.</li>
            </ul>
          We are not able to accept returns on orders for 27 inch and larger televisions or other items delivered via 'White Glove' delivery methods. If you have ordered one of these products please inspect the item carefully PRIOR TO SIGNING FOR IT. If the item is incorrect or damaged refuse the delivery and you will receive a full refund. Once the item has been accepted it will be assumed to be correct and in good working condition. Any issues that arrise after the item is signed for must be resolved through the manufacturers warranty.<br>
          <br>
          To request a Return Authorization Number (RA#) for an item, please log into "<a href="javascript:change_parent('viewaccount.htm')" class="standardurl">Your Account</a>" on the store from which your purchase was made.  Then choose the appropriate order number to process a return request for the item within the return period stated above.<br>
          <br>
          Returns will not be accepted without a RA number.  RA numbers will expire after 10 days, and the item will not be accepted if it is returned after that timeframe.  Please include the RA number on the outside of the shipping package. (Please do not write directly on the manufacturer's box).<br>
          <br>
          Returning an item(s) may change or void coupon discounts or refunds currently appearing on an order.<br>
          <br>
          For your protection, please send your return prepaid via a shipping service that can be tracked, such as UPS.  Please be sure to keep your receipt. We cannot guarantee refunds for returns sent via a non-trackable method.<br>
          <br>
          Credits are processed upon confirmation of the return by our suppliers.  Please allow up to two billing cycles for the return credit to appear on your credit card statement.  If credit cannot be issued to your credit card, a store credit will be issued.<br>

      In many instances, you may pre-order items on our site. Such items will list an expected shipping timeframe and possibly a release date. If you pre-order an item, your credit card will be charged at the time the order is placed. We will ship the item(s) to you on the actual availability date. Therefore, your total time for delivery would be:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Total time for delivery = Time until availability date + Delivery timeframe<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;(based on the shipping method chosen during the checkout process)<br>
      <br>
      Availability dates are supplied by the manufacturer or distributor of the product and are subject to change without notice. Once we learn of any changes to the availability date, we update the availability information on our site.<br>
      <br>
      If you do not wish to wait for a delay, you may request a cancellation for your order, provided that the item has not been shipped.  If we do not hear from you before we ship the item, we will assume you have agreed to the shipment delay.<br>
      <br>
      If we cannot deliver your items within 30 days of the new availability date, a cancellation will be processed automatically and you will receive a prompt refund for any unshipped portion of your order.  Please allow up to two billing cycles for the refund credit to appear on your credit card statement.<br>

      From time to time, FYE offers discounts to its customers. The coupons are simple to use and are usually based on a minimum dollar purchase or maximum discount applied.<br><br>Coupons can be redeemed during the order process, it's easy!!<br>
      <br>
      Here's how:<br>
      1. During the order process, enter your coupon code where prompted.<br>
      2. See the discount applied on your order total at the end of your ordering process. <br>
      <br>
      It's that simple!<br>

      <b>Coupon and Promotion Policies</b>
      <ul>
        <li>One coupon per customer.
        </li><li>Coupons are not valid with any other coupon offer, shipping offer or promotion.  If you enter two coupon codes, our system will accept whichever coupon you entered last.
        </li><li>Coupons and Promotions are issued with expiration dates, while supplies last.
        </li><li>Each coupon has different requirements and discounts.  Dollar-off coupons have minimum purchase amounts in product.  Percentage-off and shipping coupons have maximum dollar values.  All requirements must be met to receive your discount.
        </li><li>Some coupons are valid only in certain stores and / or on certain products.
        </li><li>Coupons cannot be replaced if the code is lost or stolen.
        </li><li>Dollar-off or percentage-off coupons are applied to the merchandise subtotal, before any shipping charges or taxes have been applied.
        </li><li>If you cancel or return item(s), this may change or void coupon discounts applied to your order.  This happens when the cancellation or return causes the merchandise subtotal (before any shipping charges or taxes have been applied) to fall below the minimum requirement.
        </li><li>If you return an item that was purchased with a coupon, you will be refunded only for the amount you paid (that is, the price of the item, less the coupon value).
        </li><li>Shipping Coupons and Promotions are not valid in Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico.
        </li><li>Refurbished item promotions are available in limited quantities only.  If an item is damaged, please see the <a href="/helpcenter.htm?file=help_policy_return" class="standardurl">Return Policy</a> for more details.  In some cases, quantities may not be available to reorder since items are available in limited quantity.
