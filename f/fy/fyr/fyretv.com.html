<h2 class="base-copy-14">Privacy Policy</h2>
    
<p>Wreal has a long-standing policy of 
protecting customer privacy.  The effective date of this policy 
is December 30, 2007.  If Wreal changes this Privacy Policy, it 
will note in this paragraph the last date on which the policy was changed.  
THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THIS POLICY WAS CHANGED WAS December 30, 2007.</p>
<p>We believe that you should know what 
information we collect from you, as well as how that information is 
used, disclosed, and protected. We have created this policy statement 
(the "Policy") to explain our privacy practices. We will not 
sell or disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties 
without your consent except as otherwise provided in this Policy. We 
may use information about who you are, where and when you browse on 
the Web, where your wireless device is located, and how you use our 
network to provide you better service and enrich your user experience 
when you sign up or use any of our products or services.</p>

<p>Wreal may make available shorter or 
machine-readable versions of this Privacy Policy. These additional policies 
are intended only as summaries of this complete Privacy Policy. This 
Policy applies to customers who purchase and use our services and products 
in the United States. Collection, use, disclosure, and protection of 
personal information may be subject to different regulation outside 
the United States. Wreal will revise and update this Policy, as it deems 
appropriate, including, for example, if our practices change or if changes 
in the law so require. You should refer back to this page for the latest 
information. </p>
<div class="base-copy-13">QUICK PRIVACY LINKS</div>

<p>The following brief summaries outline 
our Policy and then link to further detail. We also provide you the 
means to communicate with us if you have any questions about this Policy. 
This Policy also addresses what we do with information about your device 
usage, the services you buy from us, and whom you call.  <br>
</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Does Wreal Collect Personal Information 
About Me?</div>
<p>Yes, Wreal collects personal information 
about you so that we can deliver products or services you request. This 
happens automatically when you interact with us, such as when you log 
into a service. Sometimes, Wreal buys commercially available marketing 
and sales information from third parties so we can better serve you. <br>
</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">How Does Wreal Use Personal Information?</div>

<p>We use personal information for billing 
and collection purposes, to provide services or complete transactions 
you have requested, and to anticipate and resolve problems with your 
services. We may also use this information to create and inform you 
of products or services from others that may better meet your needs.  </p>
<div class="base-copy-13">When Does Wreal Disclose Personal Information?</div>
<p>We do not sell personal information 
to unaffiliated third parties. We will disclose personal information 
to third parties to complete a transaction you have requested, as part 
of the terms and conditions for a particular service, to collect on 
an account, or when we otherwise have your consent to do so. We also 
may disclose personal information to third parties to protect the rights 
and property of the company or its subscribers.  </p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Does Wreal Use Cookies?</div>
<p>Yes. Wreal uses cookies for a variety 
of reasons, including improving your shopping or browsing experience. 
In addition, cookies help us personalize the site experience for you.  <br>
</p>

<div class="base-copy-13">Does Wreal Use Web Beacons?</div>
<p>Yes. Wreal uses Web beacons, also known 
as Web bugs, on our sites so that we can identify you and deliver you 
the services you request. However, Wreal does not permit third parties 
to use Web beacons linked to personal information on our site. <br>
</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Does Wreal Place Advertising on Other 
Web Sites?</div>
<p>Wreal currently uses third-party advertising 
companies to place our ads on the Internet, and cookie and Web beacon 
technologies are used to measure the effectiveness of those ads. You 
should know that the use of such cookies is subject to the third parties' 
privacy policies, and not the policy of Wreal Broadband. <br>
</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">What about Presence, Location, and 
Tracking Information?</div>
<p>Our network knows the general location 
of your setup box whenever it is turned on. When we offer you optional 
services that require use or disclosure of this information, the terms 
and conditions for the specific service offering explain how the location 
information will be used.  <br></p>

<div class="base-copy-13">How Secure Is Information About Me?</div>
<p>We maintain a variety of physical, 
electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your personal information. </p>
<div class="base-copy-13">How can I Review Personal Information 
in my Account for Accuracy?</div>
<p>You can review the accuracy of the 
personal information in your account online (go to My Account on this 
Web site) or by contacting Customer Service at 1.888.FYRETV0 <br>
</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Will This Policy Be Updated?</div>
<p>Wreal expects to update this Policy 
periodically. You should refer back to the first paragraph of the policy 
for the effective date of any changes to the Policy.  <br>

</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">PRIVACY POLICY</div>
<p>We have created the Wreal Privacy Policy 
(the "Policy") to explain our privacy practices. When you 
use any Wreal product or service, you should understand when and how 
personal information is collected, used, disclosed, and protected.</p>
<p>We will not sell or disclose information 
to unaffiliated third parties without your consent except as otherwise 
provided in this Policy. We may use information about who you are, where 
and when you browse on the Web, where your wireless device is located, 
and how you use our network to provide you better service and enrich 
your user experience when you sign up or use any of our products or 
services.</p>
<p>Wreal will revise and update this Policy 
if our practices change or if changes in the law so require.  <br>
</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Information Collected About You</div>
<p>We collect a variety of personal information 
about users of our products or services. Personal information is information 
that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity, such 
as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or information 
about activities directly linked to that person.</p>

<p>Our definition of personal information 
does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information 
is data we collect about a group or category of services or customers 
from which individual customer identities have been removed. For example, 
we could prepare a report that indicates that a certain number of our 
customers always use their setup box at a certain time of day at a specific 
location. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs 
so that we can better consider new services or tailor existing services 
to customer desires. The aggregate data also might be purchased by or 
shared with a third party – for example, one interested in locating 
a business in a particular part of town.</p>
<p>Here are the types of personal and 
other information we collect. You should refer to the rest of this Policy 
to see how we use, disclose, and protect that information: </p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Information You Give Us</div>
<p>We collect information you give us 
when you purchase a Wreal product or use its services. For example, 
you may provide us a billing address and credit information, including 
your social security number or business identifier, when signing up 
for service or perhaps purchasing a product through our online store. 
Even the number dialed from you wireless phone to make a call is example 
of information you give us that we collect and use to bill you appropriately 
or investigate fraudulent usage.  <br></p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Automatically Collected Information</div>
<p>We automatically receive certain types 
of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you 
visit a Wreal Web site, our systems automatically collect your IP address 
and the type of browser you use. When you browse the wireless Web, our 
systems log the Web sites you visit. Similarly, all wireless communications 
systems recognize when your phone is turned on and approximately where 
the device is located, allowing calls or messages to be delivered to 
you in real time. <br></p>

<div class="base-copy-13">Information from Other Sources</div>
<p>We may obtain information about you 
from outside sources and add it to or combine it with your account information. 
For example, we may receive credit information for initiating service. 
We also may use commercially available demographic and marketing information 
from third parties to help us better serve you or inform you about products 
or services that we think would interest to you. We sometimes receive 
updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other 
sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase 
or communication more easily. And, we often receive information from 
the dealer from whom you purchase your wireless phone or device prior 
to initiating service with us.</p>
<p>We also may purchase e-mail lists from 
third parties for advertising purposes. We only purchase lists of individuals 
who have allowed third-party use of their e-mail address for marketing 
purposes. If you have previously requested to participate in an e-mail-advertising 
program, the information we receive may include your name, information 
on previous transactions, or any other personal information you have 
provided. </p>
<p>Wreal recognizes that parents often 
purchase our products and services for family use, including for use 
by minors. Any information collected from such usage will appear to 
be the personal information of the actual subscriber to the service, 
and will be treated as such under this Policy. If we make available 
offers and products online where a child informs us that he or she is 
under the age of 18, we will not grant access to the Web site.</p>
<p>In a business agreement, our customer 
is a business or other entity purchasing service for employees or other 
authorized users. If you receive certain benefits through a business 
agreement with us, this Policy will generally govern your personal information. 
However, if you receive service where a business or government entity 
pays Wreal for your account or is otherwise liable to Wreal for the 
charges (for example, as a guarantor if you fail to pay), we may share 
your account information with that entity. If you receive certain benefits 
tied to a business agreement, but you are liable for your own charges, 
then we may share enough account information with that entity to verify 
your continuing eligibility for those benefits. Please contact Wreal 
if you have any questions about who is the liable party on your bill. </p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Children's Online Privacy Protection 
Act <br></div>

<p>If we make available offers and products 
online where a child informs us that he or she is under the age of 18, 
we will not grant access to the Web site.</p>
<p>You should be aware, however, that 
our products and services purchased for residential use may be used 
by minors without the knowledge of Wreal. If that happens, any information 
collected from the usage will appear to be the personal information 
of the actual adult subscriber and treated as such under this Policy.</p>
<p>Please note that this site contains 
sexually oriented adult material intended for individuals 18 years of 
age or older and of legal age to view sexually explicit material as 
determined by the local and national laws of the region in which you 
reside. If you are not yet 18, if adult material offends you, or if 
you are accessing this site from any country or locale where adult material 
is specifically prohibited by law, DO NOT PROCEED! </p>

<p align="center"><b>Please specify your 
date of birth to continue:</b> </p>

<div class="base-copy-13">Use of Personal Information</div>
<div class="base-copy-13">Internal Use</div>
<p>In general, we use personal information 
to serve our customers, to enhance and extend our customer relationship, 
and to enable our customers to take maximum advantage of products and 
services we think they would enjoy. For example, by understanding how 
you use our Web site, we are able to customize and personalize your 
experience. More specifically, we use personal information for billing 
purposes, to provide services or complete transactions you have requested, 
to anticipate and resolve problems with your services, and to create 
and inform you of products or services from Wreal or others that better 
meet your needs. </p>

<p>Wreal uses e-mail, short text messages, 
telemarketing, and direct mail to inform you about products or services 
we think will interest you. You can modify your preferences on receiving 
these types of communication: </p>
<p>If you are currently a Wreal, LLC customer 
and wish to change your preferences of the types of communication you 
receive, you can do one of the following:</p>
<p>Complete an online form</p>
<p>Visit the "My Profile" page, 
if you manage your account online.</p>
<p>Call Customer Service at 1.888.FYRETV.0  <br>
</p>
<p>If you are not a current customer of 
Wreal and wish to opt out of receiving marketing communications, you 
can complete a short online form. <br></p>

<p>While you may choose not to receive 
marketing information from us, you will continue to receive invoices, 
customer service-related notifications, and other similar information 
from us electronically or otherwise. <br></p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Third-Party Use</div>
<p>You should review the following section 
to understand when Wreal discloses personal information to third parties. <br>
</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Disclosure of Personal Information</div>
<p>Information about our customers is 
one of our most important business assets, and therefore we strive to 
protect it and keep it confidential. We do not sell personal information 
to third parties without your consent. When and what types of information 
Wreal discloses depends on the services as well as the choices you have 
made. </p>
<p>Wreal will not disclose personal information 
other than in accordance with this Policy. In most cases, this means 
that you must consent to the disclosure in advance. Depending on the 
service, we may obtain your consent in a number of ways, including:</p>
<p>In writing;</p>

<p>Verbally;</p>
<p>Online by clicking a button;</p>
<p>Through the use of a dialing string 
or button on any device or handset; or at the time of initiation of 
a particular service offering, when your consent is part of the required 
terms and conditions to use that service.</p>
<p>For example, your consent to disclose 
personal information can be implied simply by the nature of your request, 
such as when you ask us to deliver an e-mail or short message to another 
person. Your return address is disclosed as part of the service and 
your consent to do so is implied by your use of the service. To determine 
how personal information may be disclosed as part of a particular service, 
you should review the terms and conditions of use for that service.</p>
<p>We share personal information with 
third parties as necessary to complete a transaction, perform a service 
on our behalf (such as enhancing our ability to serve you better), or 
perform a service that you have requested. When the third party acts 
solely on our behalf, Wreal does not allow them to use your information 
for other purposes. For example, our vendors process and print your 
billing statement on our behalf. They can only use the personal information 
we give them to produce the billing statement. When we write off an 
account for non-payment, Wreal sometimes discloses personal information 
about the account to third parties such as credit bureaus. Credit bureaus 
may use the personal information to update their records.   <br>
</p>
<p>In addition to our services, you may 
choose to take advantage of services and products offered by other companies 
utilizing our service. In those cases, you will be providing information 
to those companies, and any information about you received by those 
third parties will be governed by their privacy policies, not this Policy. 
If you purchase something using our Internet service, you will be disclosing 
personal information directly to the company facilitating the transaction, 
a merchant bank, and the merchant. Whenever third parties have a role 
in any such transaction, you should review their privacy policies as 
well. </p>
<p>From time to time you may be able to 
participate in contests, giveaways, or other similar promotions we sponsor. 
Except as explained otherwise in the rules for a particular contest, 
giveaway, or promotion, any personal information you provide will be 
used in accordance with this Policy. </p>
<p>In addition, from time to time you 
may be able to participate in our surveys to help us improve our offerings 
and services. Except as explained otherwise in the survey, any personal 
information so collected will be used for our internal purposes. </p>

<p>Under federal law, you have a right, 
and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of information about 
your telephone usage, the services you buy from us, who you call, and 
the location of your device on our network when you make a voice call. 
This information is sometimes referred to as "Customer Proprietary 
Network Information," or "CPNI." We share CPNI and other 
personal information about you with affiliates of Wreal, LLC that provide 
telecommunications services to which you also subscribe. Before sharing 
CPNI in any other way, we will first notify you of your rights under 
the law, describe how we intend to use the CPNI, and give you an opportunity 
to opt out of such usage (or, when required by law, to opt in). <br>
</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Business Transfers</div>
<p>Information about our users, including 
personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, 
sale of company assets, or transition of service to another person or 
entity, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, 
or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as 
one of the business assets of the company.  <br></p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Protection of Wreal and Others</div>

<p>We release personal information when 
we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or in good 
faith reliance on legal process (e.g., court orders, subpoenas, E911 
information, etc.); enforce or apply our customer agreements; initiate, 
render, bill, and collect for services; protect our rights or property, 
or protect users of those services and other carriers from fraudulent, 
abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services; facilitate 
or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations 
due to a local, state, or federal government; or if we reasonably believe 
that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical 
injury to any person requires disclosure of communications, or justifies 
disclosure of records, to a governmental entity without delay.  </p>
<div class="base-copy-13">WREAL Use of Cookies</div>
<p>Cookies are small files placed on your 
computer's hard drive by a Web site when you visit. These files identify 
your computer and record your preferences and other data about your 
visit so that when you return to the site, the site knows who you are 
and can personalize your visit. For example, cookies enable a Web site 
shopping cart to function so that you only have to check out once. Consequently, 
cookies are often tied to the use of personally identifiable information 
while using our site, and some functionality may be lost if you choose 
not to accept the use of cookies. </p>
<p>In general, we use cookies to collect 
information so that we can determine how to improve our site by seeing 
which areas, features, and products are most popular; to personalize 
the site and make recommendations based on products you have liked in 
the past as well as to improve the site experience; and to complete 
transactions you have requested. Advertisers that serve ads on our site 
may also use their own cookies. Such outside cookies are governed by 
the privacy policies of the entities placing the ads and are not subject 
to this Policy. </p>
<p>We also use a session-based cookie 
that maintains a user's session for continuity of navigation while viewing 
the site. After closing the browser the session cookie simply terminates. </p>
<p>With wireless Internet service, cookies 
are also used by our suppliers and third-party vendors to facilitate 
the various services and information offered. Depending on the phone 
or device being used, cookies may be stored locally on the phone or 
device, or on servers operated by Wreal. This Internet cookie-like functionality 
is in place for the same reasons and designed for the same purposes 
as cookies placed on your computer when interacting with Internet Web 
sites. Our suppliers and vendors will only use this information to provision 
the service, but each site you visit while using the wireless Internet 
service is controlled by a separate company and their individual privacy 
policies will govern information they receive automatically from the 
cookie or information you voluntarily provide. <br></p>

<div class="base-copy-13">Wreal Use of Web Beacons</div>
<p>A Web beacon, also known as a Web bug, 
is a small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an 
e-mail message that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party 
to monitor the address and other information of the computer viewing 
the item. Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are 
typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background 
of the Web page, document, or e-mail message. Web beacons are represented 
as HTML IMG tags in the Web page; users can click on "view profiles" 
of the Web page to see whether the page is using a Web beacon. Web beacons 
collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, 
the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from, and the time it was viewed. 
Web beacons can also be linked to personal information. </p>
<p>Wreal does not place Web beacons that 
link to personal information on other sites, nor does it permit third 
parties, other than those working on our behalf, to place them on our 
site. Wreal does use Web beacons itself and may link a particular beacon 
to personal information. For example, we may use a beacon to ensure 
a user can flip between technical assistance, customer service, and 
our online store, and still be recognized as our customer.  <br>
</p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Placement of Advertising on Other Web 
Sites</div>
<p>Wreal may use third-party ad-serving 
companies to place advertisements about our products and services on 
other Web sites. These companies may use cookies and other technology 
such as Web beacons or tagging to measure the effectiveness of our ads. 
To measure advertising effectiveness and offer selective ad content, 
the ad-serving companies may use anonymous information about your visits 
to our and other Web sites. But the ad-serving companies use an anonymous 
number to identify you, NOT your name, address, phone number, e-mail 
address, or anything that personally identifies you. The use of such 
cookies is subject to the ad-serving company's privacy policy, not the 
Policy of Wreal.  </p>

<div class="base-copy-13">Network and Information Security</div>
<p>We maintain a variety of physical, 
electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. 
For example, we use accepted tools and techniques to guard against unauthorized 
access to our systems. Also, we grant access to personal information 
about you to employees and contractors who need to know that information 
to provide products or services to you. In addition, we work to protect 
the security of your personal information when you are ordering new 
service via this Web site by using well-known Internet encryption technologies 
like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). We also use encryption technologies 
to protect your account information when you are viewing your bill on 
our Web site. You should be aware that Wreal has no control over the 
security of other sites on the Internet you might visit, interact with, 
or from which you buy products or services. <br></p>
<div class="base-copy-13">What Can I Do to Protect My Personal 
Information?</div>
<p>An important part of ensuring the security 
of personal information is your own effort to protect against unauthorized 
access to your account and the personal information contained in it. 
Our service uses passwords to prevent unauthorized access to your service 
account and your voicemail. If you write down your passwords or user 
names, keep the information in a secure location. Do not give your password 
to someone else unless you intend them to have the same full access 
and ability to make changes to your account as you have. Change your 
passwords periodically. <br></p>
<div class="base-copy-13">Accuracy of Personal Information in 
Your Account </div>
<p>You can review the accuracy of the 
personal information in your account records online (go to My Account 
on this Web site) or by contacting Customer Service at Call Customer 
Service at 1.888.FYRETV.0   If you believe any of your information 
is in error, you may contact Customer Service to correct the information 
you believe is in error.  If you believe Wreal received information 
about you in error or through the wrongdoing of a third party, contact 
Customer Service and Wreal will reasonably respond to your requests 
to change, delete or alter the information. 
</p>

<div class="base-copy-13">Updating this Policy</div>
<p>Wreal will revise or update this Policy 
as it deems appropriate, including for example, if our practices change; 
if we change existing or add new services; if we develop better ways 
to inform you of products we think will be of interest; or if the law 
so requires. You should refer back to this page often for the latest 
information and the effective date of any changes. </p>
<p>If, however, users' personally identifiable 
information will be used in a manner materially different from that 
stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via posting on 
this page for 30 days before the material change is made. Users will 
have a choice as to whether or not their information will be used in 
this materially different manner. </p>
<p>Wreal uses email, short text messages, 
telemarketing, and direct mail to inform you about products or services 
we think will interest you. If you do not wish to receive these types 
of communications, learn how you can opt out.
