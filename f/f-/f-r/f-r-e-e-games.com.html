    <br>
      <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> <br>
    As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for   all recipients of ValueClick Media advertising, we may use log files, web   beacons and cookies to collect data from browsers, advertiser and third party   sites (“Sites”) to aggregate Information. The Information collected is used for   marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well,   allows us to more effectively match advertisements and website content to your   interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to   maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business   partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our   business partners and clients regarding use of ValueClick Media’s services. <br>
    <br>
“Log files” track actions occurring on Sites and collect data including   your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages,   platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed. <br>
    <br>
"Web beacons" are electronic files used to track your navigation of a   website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of   applications and browsing behavior. <br>
    <br>
"Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP   cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your   computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience   web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user   clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through   destination. We may use Cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising   campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine   with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are   also used to control the delivery of a series of advertisements to a web   browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one   advertisement. <br>
    <br>
    There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they   remain on your system: (i) “Session Cookies” are used only during your visit to   the Sites and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) “Persistent   Cookies” remain on your browser for 2 years from your last visit to the Sites   and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Sites and provide more   relevant content to you on such Sites. <br>
    <br>
    There are many misconceptions   about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies   cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell   us an e-mail address or any other PII. ValueClick Media does not and cannot use   Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer. <br>

    <strong><a id="sharing" name="sharing"></a>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION </strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Information   Shared by ValueClick Media.</strong> <br>
    ValueClick Media will only share your   Information for the limited purposes provided for in this Privacy Policy. This   includes sharing Information (1) to enable third party service providers to   assist or facilitate in the services we provide to our clients; (2) to comply   with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant   or other lawful request for information received by Us, whether or not a   response is required by applicable law; (3) to enforce our terms of use or to   protect our rights ; (4) to protect the safety of members of the public and   users of the service; (5) with other ValueClick Entities and third party   marketing partners (including advertisers and publishers) for marketing   purposes; (6) with vendors, administrative service providers, technology   providers, and carefully selected partners for data validation, enhancement,   information verification and suppression services or (7) for any other purpose   for which you provide consent. We also may share Information with advertisers,   publishers and other third parties for marketing purposes, but such Information   does not include PII. While ValueClick Media strongly encourages clients and   partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, ValueClick Media   is not responsible for the information practices of such clients and partners.   The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are   subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from this Privacy   Policy. <br>
    <br>
    In the event that ValueClick Media is acquired by or merged with   a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to   transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such   merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of   our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the   benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles   affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your   Information is treated, transferred, or used. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Information   Collected by Third Party Sites. </strong><br>
    Please be aware that the websites   of our advertiser clients as well as the websites on which we place   advertisements or any third party websites linked to one of our sites also may   collect information from you. Such information may include non-personally   identifiable information through the use of Cookies and other technology and any   personally identifiable information you may choose to give in registering and   transacting with such website. Although we choose our business partners and   clients carefully, ValueClick Media is not responsible for the privacy practices   of websites operated by such third parties. You should check the applicable   privacy policies of such websites you visit to determine how they handle any   information they collect from you. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><a id="choices" name="choices"></a>YOUR CHOICES</strong> <br>
    <br>
    ValueClick Media also offers   “opt-out Cookies” to block the placement of future ValueClick Media Cookies on   your system for 10 years from the time you opted out. If you have multiple   internet browsers or users on the same computer, you will need to perform the   opt-out operation for each browser and/or user. If you or your privacy software   deletes the opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to repeat the   process. <br>

    Please note that the above link for   opt-out Cookies is only applicable to ValueClick Media and not any other   ValueClick company website. Also, please note that use of the opt-out Cookies   will affect our ability to provide you content and advertisements that will more   effectively match your interests and may prevent us from controlling the   frequency with which you may view any particular advertisement. Please report   any problems related to the opt-out process to <a href="mailto:privacy@valueclick.com">privacy@valueclick.com</a>.<br>

    <strong>PROCESSING   AND STORING YOUR DATA </strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Data Processing.</strong> <br>
    The   European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ   significantly from the laws of the United States of America (“US”). To reconcile   these differences, the US and the EU have created a safe harbor (“Safe Harbor”)   that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations.

No   transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure. Unauthorized   entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise   data security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this risk when communicating   with us. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><a id="changes" name="changes"></a>CHANGES</strong> <br>
    <br>
    As the standards governing Internet privacy continue to evolve,   ValueClick Media may find it appropriate or necessary to update this Privacy   Policy from time to time. As a result, we reserve the right to change this   privacy policy at any time and shall post such changes on the Website. Our   Website will state the date the Privacy Policy was last updated. We encourage   you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you use this Website to make sure you   understand how your information will be used.
