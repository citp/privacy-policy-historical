Our cookies do not track user movement once you leave our Web site.

Most Web browsers allow the user to be notified upon the proposed installation of a cookie and the user can then decline the cookie. Even if you decline the cookie, you may continue to use our entire Web site.

We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers� personally identifiable information.  

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see �Choice and Opt-out.
