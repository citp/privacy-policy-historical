# F-Secure : Welcome to F-Secure, Securing the Mobile Distributed Enterprise

**Privacy Notice**

F-Secure respects your right to privacy and we understand the inherent privacy risks involved in using the Internet. For this reason, we believe that you, our customer, have the right to know exactly how we collect and use information at our web pages. 

**What We Collect**  
We can collect non-personally identifiable information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address or most-recently-visited URL. However, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, such as by purchasing a F-Secure product, by filling out a form or survey, entering a contest or sweepstakes, registering your email address with us or emailing us. We may also collect personal information from you at other points on our site that state that personal information is being collected. 

**How We Use the Information**  
F-Secure uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to provide you with program upgrades, to update you on service and benefits, and to personalize our web sites for you. 

F-Secure may also use personal account information and data collected through to generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use and for sharing with affiliates, subsidiaries, licensees, successors and advertisers. These statistics and aggregate reports will not contain any personally identifiable information. Your identity is kept anonymous. 

We use page view and navigation information to ensure that users can find information on our web sites as quickly as possible. We collect demographic information through promotional programs to better identify the products and services that will fulfil users' needs. Finally, we use information collected when users make online purchases to check their qualifications, verify their identity, as well as for billing and shipping purposes. 

F-Secure uses email as an avenue with which to provide customer service and technical support. We do not release any contact information about the user for any purpose. We may contact the customer using this information in an attempt to resolve a prior issue, proactively notify you of technical issues which may affect you, or if applicable, perform the services for which such data was collected (i.e., if you sign up for an email newsletter, we will send the email newsletter to the address you provide us). 

**Promotions and Special Offers**  
From time to time, F-Secure will extend promotions, special offers, and other information to our customers. You can subscribe for the special campaigns mailing list by selecting the box "Yes I want the F-Secure News & Update Info" in our purchase information form. In addition, we may include related information and offers from F-Secure-approved third parties. Upon request, we will immediately remove any customer from our mailing list. 

**Who We Share it with**   
F-Secure will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to any third parties. So, for example, we do not sell your email addresses or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers. However, we might share your personally identifiable information with F-Secure business partners who are acting on our behalf.
