# Website privacy policy | F-Secure

This policy describes the privacy practices on our website. Any personally identifiable data that you submit to us (e.g. via web forms) is processed according to the F-Secure [Personal data policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20170710134813id_/https%3A//www.f-secure.com/en/web/legal/privacy/services).

When you access our website, it may place cookies on your computer. When accessing our site, you agree to accept such cookies. If you do not want to receive such cookies, we advise you to change your browser settings.

The purpose for data collection from our website is website personalization and development as well as web marketing activities.

##  Website personalization and development

To personalize and develop our website, we collect data on how you use it via cookies, web beacons and other customary means.

The information collected via cookies helps us to understand how our website visitors find and use our website and how long they stay. We use this information to improve the usefulness and overall usability of our website, to deliver you customized content, to test and optimize our website, and to locate any issues or problems with the website itself and your usage of it.

We do this user behavior analysis by way of aggregate statistics and/or by help of third party web analytic providers, which help us create user profiles based on pseudonyms. We also generate statistics and aggregate reports for internal use and share them with F-Secure group companies, partners and advertisers. Our third party web analytic providers may also create and publish aggregate reports on the data collected. The statistics and aggregate reports do not contain any data that could be linked to any individual website visitor.

We do not seek to use cookies to find out your identity. Nor do we connect your IP address to you or collect any information that directly identifies you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us. For example, you will need to submit personal information if you buy an F-Secure product, fill out a form or survey, enter a contest or sweepstakes, register your e-mail address with us, or e-mail us.

###  Web marketing activities

The data that we collect can also be used for marketing purposes. To identify products that may interest you, we may collect information about pages that you visited or products that you bought so that we can market relevant services to you.

We work with e-commerce sites to provide targeted advertising to our customers.

When you visit our website, a third-party website (for example our partner's site), or click an advertisement for F-Secure services, your web activities may be tracked through cookies. The cookies are generated by our marketing partners to advertise our services on other websites. Our marketing partners may provide their own cookies to display personalized, F-Secure-related advertisements.

These cookies typically collect data about e-commerce sites that you have visited, for example, the pages you viewed and the products you bought. This data is used for statistical purposes and will not be used to identify you.

Our goal is to advertise our products and services based on what people have seen or intended to buy on e-commerce sites. We advertise these products and services through customized banners on our own and third-party websites. We may use information that you have submitted to us to market our services to you.

We do not sell your personal data to third-party advertisers. Information that cannot be used to identify you may be shared with our advertising or business partners. They may also use cookies to track what ads you have seen and what ads you appear to be interested in.
