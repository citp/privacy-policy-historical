# FTD Florists Online

**Secure Shopping**   
Ordering from our network of FTD Florists Online is easy, convenient, and very safe. The FTD Florists Online Network uses Verisign, a leading provider of Internet protection services, including digital certification, to secure every transaction. This software encrypts all the personal information that you send us (including credit card numbers, names, addresses, and telephone numbers) so that your private information cannot be read by anyone as it travels over the Internet. 

The FTD Florists Online Network also uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than the FTD Florists Online Network.

**Account Protection**   
If you choose to open an account with any one of our FTD florist web sites, your password will be your personal, secret entry code to the FTD Florists Online Network for use with any of the sites you choose to shop with. The passwords are encrypted on the database, and therefore cannot be read by anyone who accesses this data. Your password is needed to access any account areas. Your password keeps your account information private and secure. You can change your password as many times as you like.

**Collection and Use of Information**   
When you place an order, we require you to provide us with personal contact and billing information, including your address and telephone number. We use this information to give you a customized experience and to process the orders that you place with us. 

When you place an order, your account information is saved only if you ask us to save it. When you do our database stores your billing and delivery information and automatically transfers it to the order form each time you place an order. This way you do not have to re-enter this information each time you return to order. 

If you open an account, you have access to an address book that includes addresses and other contact information about persons to whom you have sent flowers or gifts. You can view or edit information on your address book at any time. 

Recipient information is used for delivery purposes. On some occasions, the recipient may be called to schedule delivery. 

At the time of registering for an account, you also have the option to opt in for our additional services, which include a personal date reminder service and a free online address book. We use your contact information so that you may take full advantage of these interactive tools. You have the option to opt out of these additional services at any time. 

When you visit any of the FTD Florists Online web sites in our network, we would like you to be aware of the fact that we do collect some basic non-identifying information. This specifically includes information regarding your operating system, browser software, and IP (Internet Protocol) address. This information is collected in order to provide you with satisfactory service. We may use the information to detect problems with our server and/or to aid in the administration of our network of floral web sites.
