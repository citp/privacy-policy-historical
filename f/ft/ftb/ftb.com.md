# First Tennessee | Powering Your Dreams : Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy 

We value your relationship with us, and we know that respect for your privacy is the very foundation of that relationship. Since our company was founded in 1864, we have built a reputation based on trust. Advances in technology have made safeguarding private information all the more important. We are committed to safeguarding the information you share with us.

## About this Privacy Notice

This notice describes our privacy policies, including how we collect, use and safeguard customer information. It also explains how you can direct us not to share or use certain types of information within our family of companies. 

## What Information is Covered by this Notice? 

This notice applies to non-public personal information we collect about individuals who obtain products or services from us that are to be used primarily for personal, family or household purposes, including former customers. We call this information "Customer Information".

## What Kinds of Customer Information Do We Collect? 

We collect the following types of Customer Information: 

  * Income, marital status, age, driver license and Social Security numbers and other information from applications and other forms you complete and other oral, written or electronic communications 
  * Loan payment history, account balances and other information about transactions you conduct with us, our affiliates, or others 
  * Account information from other companies that you may ask us to maintain online for you 
  * Credit scores or credit histories from credit reporting agencies and other information such as demographic information and insurance claims information we receive from third parties 



## Do We Share Customer Information with Outside Companies? 

We do not share Customer Information with outside companies to use for their own marketing purposes. Outside companies that provide us services (such as printing or mailing) or help us provide you with products or services you request (such as clearing brokerage transactions or underwriting insurance) may receive Customer Information to help us provide you with these products and services. We may also provide Customer Information to companies that perform marketing services for us or to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. These companies help us provide you with a full range of financial products and services, and **they are obligated to keep Customer Information confidential.** We also share Customer Information with others when it is required or permitted by law, such as credit bureaus, or to comply with subpoenas and summonses.

## Do We Use or Share Customer Information Within Our Family of Companies? 

We use Customer Information about you and share it among the financial service providers in our family of companies to help us provide you with our products and service and to provide you with superior service and value. Sharing Customer Information can **save you time** because you are not continually supplying our affiliates with the same information. It can **reduce the amount of unwanted mail** you receive because we send you only information that may truly interest you. It also **allows you to get the assistance you need** through our telephone service centers. Our internal financial service providers, such as broker-dealers and insurance agents may use your Customer Information to offer you products or services that could benefit you. 

## How Can You Limit Our Use of Customer Information About You? 

Federal law gives you the right to limit how we use Customer Information about you in two ways. 

  1. _**The Affiliate Sharing Opt-out.** You may direct that Customer Information about you (other than transaction and experience information) not be shared among our family of companies._
  2. _**The Affiliate Marketing Opt-out.** You may direct that Customer Information about you shared among our family of companies not be used to market products and services to you._



**If you choose either of these opt-out rights, we will treat it as if you have chosen both the Affiliate Sharing Opt-out _and_ the Affiliate Marketing Opt-out**, and you may not receive information about products and services that may interest you. If you have already exercised these opt-out rights, you do not have to tell us again. 

**To exercise your opt-out rights, please call us at (877) 242-9880**. When you call, someone will be able to answer your questions about privacy. **The opt-outs will remain in effect until you tell us otherwise**. 

If you have a joint account, we will treat the exercise of your opt-out rights as applying only to you unless you tell us that you are acting on behalf of the other account holders. If your insurance policy names more than one person as the insured parties, we will treat the exercise of your opt-out rights as applying only to you unless you tell us that you are acting on behalf of the other insured parties. 

## How Do We Protect Customer Information?

Our employees have limited access to Customer Information. They have access only when it will help you do business with us or help us do business with you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable laws and regulations to protect Customer Information. 

## What About Health Information?

We may collect personally identifiable health information, like medical reports, for certain products or services that we offer. We do not share personally identifiable health information with anyone except as may be requested or authorized by you or required in connection with processing a product or service you have requested or as required or permitted by law. 

## What if Your Information is Not Correct?

We have procedures in place to maintain accurate Customer Information. These procedures include responding to requests to correct inaccurate Customer Information. If you believe our customer records contain incorrect information about you, call or write to us at the telephone number or address listed on your account statement. 

## How Do We Keep You Up to Date on our Privacy Policies? 

We will provide you with a privacy notice each year as long as you have a relationship with us. If we make material changes to our notice, we will let you know. We will also post our updated privacy notice on our website, www.firsttennessee.com. If you open another account or obtain another product or service from another company within our family of companies, you may receive another copy of this privacy notice. Certain customers may receive a separate notice about specific privacy policies that may apply to their products or services. This privacy notice was last updated in April 2009, and replaces any previous notices you may have received about the privacy policies for our family of companies. 

## What If You Suspect Identity Theft? 

If you are concerned that someone has unauthorized access to your personal information, please call us immediately at (800) 382-5465 and select option "zero" so we can take steps to help protect you. You should also report your concerns to: 

  * Your local law enforcement officials 
  * The Federal Trade Commission identity theft hotline at (877) ID-THEFT 
  * The Social Security Administration fraud hotline at (800) 269-0271 
  * Your credit card companies. Remember, knowing where to find your credit card information and toll-free contact numbers will help in an emergency.

## Special Notice for Vermont Residents 

In order to comply with Vermont law, we will treat all accounts with a Vermont mailing address as if you have requested that we not share your Customer Information with another company in our family of companies and as if you requested that our affiliates not use Customer Information to market their products and services to you.
