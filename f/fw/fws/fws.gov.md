### **PRIVACY STATEMENT**

In accordance with the [Department of the Interior Privacy Policy](http://www.doi.gov/ocio/privacy/ "Link to non-FWS site"), The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is committed to maintaining a web site that protects the individual’s right to privacy. We do **not** require personal information from our visitors, nor do we collect any personally identifying information (name, email address, Social Security number, or other unique identifier) unless you knowingly provide it. Likewise, we do **not** give, sell, or transfer any personal information to a third party except as might be required by law .

**Data Collection for Statistics**  
To aid in web site management, certain information is collected for statistical purposes. The Service uses specialized software to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest to our customers, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.

We collect only the following information about your visit:
