          is committed to maintaining a web site that protects the individual’s
          right to privacy. We do <strong>not</strong> require
        personal information from our visitors, nor do we collect any personally
        identifying information (name, email address, Social Security number, or
        other unique identifier) unless you knowingly provide it. Likewise, we
        do <strong>not</strong> give, sell, or transfer any personal information

      and identifying system performance or problem areas.</font></p>
