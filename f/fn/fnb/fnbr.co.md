We limit the amount of information we collect to a minimum.

#### User Accounts

Logging into our website requires authorisation through either Twitter or Discord. This does **not** give us access to private information such as Direct Messages.

We store the username and ID for the platform you authenticated with (Twitter or Discord) and keep track of your votes/comments on item pages to aid spam prevention and to provide features such as [reminders](https://web.archive.org/reminders).

If you have API access, we also store when you last used your API key, when it was last changed and the key itself. Allowing us to limit or revoke access if necessary, to prevent abuse.

We also keep track of the language you have chosen to use via the language picker built into the site. This is stored as a cookie and, if logged in, sent to our servers to be saved to your user account for continuity at future logins.
