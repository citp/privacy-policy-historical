# Privacy Policy - Fnatic

(Last updated: 23rd October 2015)

Fnatic.com (the “Site”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Service. For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to the Site’s service. The terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the Site. “You” refers to you, as a user of the Service. By accepting our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (found here: http://fnatic.com/terms-service), you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

### I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your email address, which you submit to us through the registration process at the Site.

### INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY

To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your email address. To use the Service thereafter, you do not need to submit further Personal Information. However, in an effort to improve the quality of the Service, our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”), which may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web pages you visited that had certain Site features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used the Site, and cookie data. Depending on how you access the Service, we may track information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Site settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit the Site. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Site account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not. The Site may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. Cookies may also be used for the purpose of advertising the Service on third party websites through a technique known as ‘Retargeting’ or ‘Remarketing’ - cookies used for the purpose of advertising contain only Non-Personal Information. When you visit the Site, our third party advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser, which may be used to target relevant advertisements to you when you visit third party websites. You can opt out of receiving targeted advertising and review your options by visiting the following link(s):

### II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION

#### PERSONAL INFORMATION

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for the Site, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to user’s email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, provide technical support, and inform users about promotional offers.

#### NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION

In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion. In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We suggest that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.

### III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION

We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption and firewalls. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.

### IV. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes. When we send a promotional communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional e-mail.
