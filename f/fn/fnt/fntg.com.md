Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary companies (collectively, “FNF,” “our,” or “we”) respect
and are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use, and protect personal
information, when and to whom we disclose such information, and the choices you have about the use and disclosure of
that information.
Types of Information Collected
We may collect two types of information from you: Personal Information and Browsing Information.
Personal Information. FNF may collect the following categories of Personal Information:
• contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number, email address);
• demographic information (e.g., date of birth, gender, marital status);
• identity information (e.g. Social Security Number, driver’s license, passport, or other government ID number);
• financial account information (e.g. loan or bank account information); and
• other personal information necessary to provide products or services to you.
Browsing Information. FNF may automatically collect the following types of Browsing Information when you access an
FNF website, online service, or application (each an “FNF Website”) from your Internet browser, computer, and/or mobile
device:
• Internet Protocol (IP) address and operating system;
• browser version, language, and type;
• domain name system requests; and
• browsing history on the FNF Website, such as date and time of your visit to the FNF Website and visits to the pages
  within the FNF Website.
How Personal Information is Collected
We may collect Personal Information about you from:
• information we receive from you on applications or other forms;
• information about your transactions with FNF, our affiliates, or others; and
• information we receive from consumer reporting agencies and/or governmental entities, either directly from these entities
   or through others.
How Browsing Information is Collected
If you visit or use an FNF Website, Browsing Information may be collected during your visit. Like most websites, our
servers automatically log each visitor to the FNF Website and may collect the Browsing Information described above. We
use Browsing Information for system administration, troubleshooting, fraud investigation, and to improve our websites.
Browsing Information generally does not reveal anything personal about you, though if you have created a user account for
an FNF Website and are logged into that account, the FNF Website may be able to link certain browsing activity to your
user account.
Other Online Specifics
Cookies. When you visit an FNF Website, a “cookie” may be sent to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that
is sent to your Internet browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Information gathered using
cookies helps us improve your user experience. For example, a cookie can help the website load properly or can customize
the display page based on your browser type and user preferences. You can choose whether or not to accept cookies by
changing your Internet browser settings. Be aware that doing so may impair or limit some functionality of the FNF Website.
Web Beacons. We use web beacons to determine when and how many times a page has been viewed. This information is
used to improve our websites.
Do Not Track. Currently our FNF Websites do not respond to “Do Not Track” features enabled through your browser.
