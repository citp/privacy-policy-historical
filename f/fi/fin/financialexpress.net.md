**Analytics cookies  **anonymously remember your computer when you visit the website.

**Advertising cookies** enable us to identify what types of adverts you have seen, for example so that you’re not shown the same advertisement too many times.

These cookies are anonymous- they only collect information on what you have looked at on the website, not who you are. We may also set cookies on selected other sites that we advertise on in order to identify you (anonymously) as having visited those sites before or after you’ve visited the website so we can then target our advertising based on this information.

**Other third-party cookies:** Other organisations may also set their own cookies in order to anonymously track your engagement and interaction with their products and services on the website. An example of this could be if you were to ‘like’ a Research article using the Facebook Like button, Facebook may place a cookie on your browser to measure this.
