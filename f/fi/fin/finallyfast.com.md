Ascentive's Revenue Partners program provide site traffic to [www.ascentive.com](http://www.ascentive.com/) in exchange for a percentage of sales revenue. When you order an Ascentive product and you have been referred by a Revenue Partner, the following anonymous information is provided to the Revenue Partner to calculate revenue and verify our compliance: order number, product name, product cost, and date/time. **No customer identifying information is provided to Revenue Partners unless that Revenue Partner is responsible for helping us fulfill your order, in which case your personal information will only be used by Revenue Partner to fulfill your order.** Ascentive is not responsible for information you choose to provide directly to an Ascentive Revenue Partner via their web site.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Financial information that is collected is used to bill the customer for products and services. Miscellaneous optional information collected on the order form, such as connection speed and operating system, are used in aggregate to help us make decisions about developing new products and services. Contact information you provide on your order form may be used occasionally by Ascentive or select partners to announce free updates to software items ordered, special offers and related promotions. You may opt out of this at any time. We are committed to respecting your wishes for use of your personal data.

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Ascentive uses passwords and SSL encryption to protect the security of this information.

Our software may include links or recommendations for other Ascentive products that would complement your current purchase. If you decide to activate an account and provide us with your email address, you will be automatically subscribed to receive Ascentive's periodic newsletter (SpeedElite) in the form of an html email, with information including, but not limited to, software updates, discount offers, and new software releases. If you do not wish to receive these announcements, you can remove your name from our mailing list by the unsubscribe process detailed at the bottom of each newsletter or contact Ascentive LLC via our web site at [www.ascentive.com](http://www.ascentive.com/) and request to be removed from our list.
