_”Web security is stronger than in virtually any other area of commerce. If you are happy paying for a meal, ordering goods over the phone or paying by credit card in a shop, then you should feel comfortable passing your details over the web.”_ Internet Investor Magazine.

#### SSL Encryption & Secure Servers

We process all purchase and member login transactions over our secure server using secure socket layer technology (SSL), to ensure that your account and order details are safe and secure. We also utilise additional encryption techniques in the shopping basket and account system to shield sensitive data from malicious hackers or prying eyes. In the database, passwords and credit cards are encrypted for storage using advanced crypto techniques and their details are kept in a separate section of the database from your account information. For added peace of mind, it would take 4,000 programmers over a year to exhaust all 72 quadrillion decoding keys in order to crack one small phrase passed from your computer to our secure servers.

#### Lock & Key Symbol

To prove our transaction pages are secure, look in the bottom corner of your browser window for the locked padlock or key symbol. (You must be using Netscape 2.0+ or any version of Explorer to see these symbols).

#### Paypal or Amazon Payments - Alternative Payment Options

You can place an order and keep your details private by paying with Amazon or Paypal – two of the most well-known internet payment options. Simply click on the 'Checkout with Amazon' or 'Checkout with Paypal' button on your basket page.

#### SPAM (UCE - Unsolicited Commercial E-mail)

Find Me A Gift in no way participates in mass unsolicited e-mailing (i.e. spamming), and any Find Me A Gift affiliates are expected to adhere to this policy as well. Violation of our policy will result in the termination of the affiliate contract and immediate dismissal from the Find Me A Gift Affiliate Program, with no refund.

#### Credit Card Fraud Warning

We take Credit Card fraud very seriously and we will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law. All orders have strict security clearance protocols in place with orders from overseas requiring maximum Code 10 security authentication. This means we contact the credit card issuing bank to confirm the name and address of the cardholder along with all the other regular security procedures. We pass all details of credit card fraud to the relevant authorities and ensure that issuing banks are made aware when their client's credit cards have been compromised.
