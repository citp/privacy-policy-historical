#### Information Collection and Use

**Emails and Web Forms**  
We collect information from users of our site and client portal such as name, email, school information, and phone number when you request demos or contact us. Personally identifiable information that you provide by email or web forms will be used only for such purposes as are described at the point of collection (for example on a web form), such as to send information to you or respond to your questions or comments. If you provide contact information, finalsite staff or its contractors may contact you to clarify your comment or question, or to learn about your level of satisfaction with our services. We do not share or sell any personal information to third parties except as described in this privacy policy.

In the event finalsite goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. ****

**Orders**  
If you register for a finalsite event, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and school information) and, for chargeable events, financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes for event registration or to contact you if we have difficulty processing your order.

**Testimonials**  
Our client contracts include client permission to post testimonials, both written and video, on our website. Permission to display client reference information (name, school, phone number) is obtained from our clients prior to displaying them on our site.

**Surveys**  
Occasionally we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is entirely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to improve our finalsite services and product offerings.

**Share/Email-a-Page**  
If you choose to use the +Share link available at the bottom of most site pages, you will be invoking the AddThis tool which is a third party product enabling you to easily send our website links to other sites or to email a page link to a friend. All personally identifiable information (such as name and email address) you enter here is covered by the AddThis privacy policy, available at <http://www.addthis.com/privacy>.

**Service Providers**  
We use other third parties such as a credit card processor to bill you for goods and services.  For instance, when you register for an event we will share your credit card information with our payment processor as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.

#### Information Collected and Stored Automatically

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through our website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically using cookies and log files. This information does not identify you personally.  We use this information to help make our site more useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our site, and the types of technology they use.

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base.  **We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information.**

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use both session ID and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following the instructions in your browser’s help file. 

We use session cookies to uniquely distinguish your browsing interactions from others so our site functions correctly, and persistent cookies to track and target the interests of our users to enhance your experience on our site. If you reject cookies you may still use our site, but some areas of functionality, such as contests or surveys, may be limited.

****Web Beacons**  
**

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can email us at [education@finalsite.com](mailto:education@finalsite.com).

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, finalsite uses software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage.
