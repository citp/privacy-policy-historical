<h3><font color="#336633">Regarding information that you supply on
forms</font></h3>

<p><b>Name, city, &amp; State</b>: Finishing.com is a place of
camaraderie for people with metal finishing interests. Therefore we
are NOT an anonymous service. When you post an inquiry or response,
we require and print your full name, city, and state--like a
newspaper or magazine would. If we realize that you are a minor, we
don't print your last name. After your posting is no longer current,
we will delete your last name upon request.</p>

<p><b>E-mail address:</b> We also require your e-mail address. We
don't print it except in special circumstances where you request it. Please do not disguise your e-mail
address because we can't print your posting until an auto-reply
confirms that your e-mail address works.</p>

<p><b>Company name:</b> We do not require your company name. We print
it only if you choose (and then only if we choose).</p>

<dl>
   <dt><b>What information do we make available to others?</b> We do
   not compile, maintain, or sell any mailing lists. However, this is
   an advertiser-supported site, and many visitors are looking for
   suppliers. So, on a one-contact-at-a-time basis, we do pass along
   the contact information for a specific inquiry to an advertiser
   who wishes to respond to you. When we do so, we attach the
   following instruction--
   
   </dt><dd>-------<br>
   
   PRIVACY NOTICE: This contact info is forwarded to you under the
   terms agreed to by the inquirer who provided it. You may respond
   to THIS SPECIFIC INQUIRY but you may not add this contact
   information to any database, send any unsolicited offerings of any
   type to the inquirer, nor pass this contact info to any third
   party.

   <dt><b><font color="#000000">IP Address Capture: </font></b><font color="#000000">Please remember that you are never anonymous on
   the Internet! Your IP address is always available. Finishing.com
   captures the IP address when someone fills in a form on our site,
   clicks on a banner ad, or links to an external site. </font>

   </dd><dd><font color="#000000">Why? We are a commercial website which
   can only exist with the support of our advertisers. Visitors can
   conveniently visit our site and 'click-thru' to our advertisers'
   sites from finishing.com without any need for registration here --
   so we need to be able to show that our site is directing the
   visitors to them. <br>
   
   It is also necessary to capture IP address in log files as part of
   our defense against spammers and attackers.</font>

   </dt><dt><b><font color="#000000">Cookies:</font></b><font color="#000000"> Finishing.com does not use 'cookies' internally.
   That is, we do not make automated attempts to track which pages or
   sites a particular visitor has or has not accessed, how frequently
   they have visited, etc. We do not keep logs of that nature.
   However, when you click on a banner or link that takes you to
   another site, that link may include 'tracking code' to tell that
   site that you came from finishing.com, and the external site may
   save info about you. </font>

<h3><font color="#336633">Regarding Scams</font></h3>

<p>If you submit an offer which gives us reasonable grounds for
suspicion that it is part of an illegal scam (Nigerian 419 letters,
'black money' offers, 'cleaning chemicals for defaced bills',
'copper-iridium rice pulling items') we may forward it to the
authorities without notice</p>

<h3><font color="#336633">Complaints</font></h3>

<p>If you feel that anyone has spammed you through info available from this site, please let us know.
Thanks!</p>
