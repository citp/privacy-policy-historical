# Online Privacy Policy | Final Draft

#### Online Privacy Policy

**Online Privacy Policy**

**Last updated  September 12, 2016.**

This document sets forth the Cast & Crew Production  Software, LLC dba Final Draft  (“FD”) Online Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) for these web sites, [www.finaldraft.com](http://www.finaldraft.com/) and [www.store.finaldraft.com](http://www.store.finaldraft.com/) (the “Sites”). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use these Sites. This Privacy Policy does not govern privacy practices associated with offline activities or other FD web sites.

**Changes in Privacy Policy**  
All “personal information” (“personal information” is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact or locate the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection.  FD reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion, and will provide notice of material changes on the homepages of the Sites. If as the result of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which FD is allowed to use your personal information, you can do so by following the procedure described below in the section entitled “Updating your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences.” You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, the changes to the Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Sites after such notice has been posted for thirty (30) days with the following exception: if at the time you provide personal information to  FD you are given the opportunity (as you currently are) to limit how such information will be used to communicate with you, either by FD or by third parties, FD will not change your preference in this regard without your express consent. However, if FD sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or FD (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by or merged with, another entity, FD may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent.

**Entities Collecting Personal Information**  
Personal information on these Sites is collected by FD. FD’s address is 26707 West Agoura Road, Suite 205, Calabasas, California, 91302 and its telephone number is (818) 995-8995.

These Sites contain links to other sites at which personal information is collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site. That privacy policy should identify the entity that is collecting your personal information.

**Collection of Personal Information**  
As a visitor to these Sites, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as utilizing online software applications, FD may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, FD may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal information. When ordering products or services on these Sites, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

When you use these Sites,  FD or third parties authorized by FD may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of these Sites and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of these Sites and its services. FD also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on these Sites. Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal information.

When you submit personal information to FD through these Sites, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which  FD and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of FD. Such vendors are bound by contract to not use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. One instance where this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible and the pages are being hosted by a vendor of FD.

FD has established relationships with various service providers whose services are available to you from these Sites or from web sites that are linked to these Sites. Typically, these providers offer services that FD customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with FD services and products. In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider’s web site will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site and personal information that you provide while on these Sites in conjunction with a provider’s service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with FD personal information collected from you. In such instances, FD may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In the situation where sites have an FD “look and feel,” and you reasonably believe you are on an FD site, the site is collecting information in a solely intermediary capacity and does not use personal information for secondary purposes.

In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users and prevent abuse of our system we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third party sources. For example, we may supplement your registration information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in our database.

**How your Personal Information is Used**  
FD collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. As another example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of FD and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications.

FD may collect information about the use of these Sites; such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. FD may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing or similar promotional purposes. Your Choices with Respect to Personal Information

FD recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on these Sites. Without your consent, FD will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services and special offers available from FD, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on these Sites. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, FD will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.

There are other instances in which FD may divulge your personal information. FD may provide your personal information if necessary, in FD’s good faith judgment, to comply with laws or regulations of a governmental or regulatory body or in response to a valid subpoena, warrant or order or to protect the rights of FD or others.

**Protection of Your Personal Information**  
The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a user of FD products or services or registering a  FD product is classified as Registration Information. Your Registration Information resides on a  enterprise class cloud based CRM system that only selected FD personnel and authorized contractors have access to via password. FD  strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to FD.

Personal information that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information also resides on a secure server and is only accessible to selected FD personnel and authorized contractors via password. Since this information is not accessible by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information.

**Use of Cookies**  
When you visit these Sites, you can browse these Sites and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Sites, we use “‘cookies” to track your visit. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, and enables FD to record your passwords, purchases, and preferences.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)

While FD uses cookies to track your visit to FD, and our Web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, FD does not generally use this information to identify you personally. However, if you expressly provide consent for FD to “remember” the unique identifier that you select when you register for various activities on these Sites, that unique identifier will be stored on a cookie on your computer, linked to your registration information, and your navigation path around the Sites will be tracked. We associate this data to understand how our Sites and services are being used so we can understand our customers and offer appropriate products and services.

**Software Piracy**  
FD regards software piracy as the crime it is, and we will use all legal means to eliminate piracy of our software.  As part of these efforts, Final Draft software may include a security mechanism that can detect the installation or use of illegal or modified copies of the software, and collect and transmit data about those copies.  This data collection is not designed to be performed on users of legally licensed software obtained from FD or its authorized resellers.  If you do not consent to the collection and transmission of such data (including to the United States), you must not use our software.

**Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences**  
You have the right to correct your personal information and privacy preferences (such as whether you wish to receive promotional communications from FD or third parties) by writing or calling FD at:

Final Draft  Attn: Change of Address/Privacy 26707 West Agoura Rd., Suite 205 Calabasas, CA 91302 USA Telephone Number 818-995-8995

Please include your name, address, and/or e-mail address when you contact us. Personal information submitted through these Sites that is not Registration Information is not accessible online. To access and/or correct such information, you may write FD at:

Final Draft  Privacy Officer/Customer Information 26707 West Agoura Rd., Suite 205 Calabasas, CA 91302 USA

In your correspondence, please indicate with as much detail as possible the location on these Sites where you provided your personal information.

**Privacy Related Inquiries and Complaints**  
FD takes its users’ privacy concerns seriously. If you believe that FD has not complied with this Online Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information or you have other related inquiries or concerns, you may write the FD Privacy Officer at the address indicated above.

In your letter, please describe in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the ways in which you believe that the FD Online Privacy Policy has not been complied with.

Please note that if you provide FD with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that third parties may contact you with marketing offers and indicating on another occasion that they may not), FD cannot guarantee that your most recent privacy preference will be honored.

Also, please note that FD is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of non-FD Web sites to which these sites or any other FD Web site may link. You should review the privacy policy of such sites before using the sites.
