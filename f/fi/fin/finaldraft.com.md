However, if Final Draft, Inc. sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or Final Draft, Inc. (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by or merged with, another entity, Final Draft, Inc. may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent.

The Site contains links to other sites at which personal information is collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided to the contrary, the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policy applicable to that site. That privacy policy should identify the entity that is collecting your personal information. 

Collection of Personal Information  
As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as utilizing online software applications, Final Draft, Inc. may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Final Draft, Inc. may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal information. When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. 

When you use the Site, Final Draft, Inc. or third parties authorized by Final Draft, Inc. may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. Final Draft, Inc. also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do not match such information with any of your personal information. 

When you submit personal information to Final Draft, Inc. through this Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Final Draft, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors of Final Draft, Inc.. Such vendors are bound by contract to not use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. One instance where this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the url for the pages is not visible and the pages are being hosted by a vendor of Final Draft, Inc.. 

Final Draft, Inc. has established relationships with various service providers whose services are available to you from this Site or from web sites that are linked to this Site. Typically, these providers offer services that Final Draft, Inc. customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with Final Draft, Inc. services and products. In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider's web site will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site and personal information that you provide while on this Site in conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with Final Draft, Inc. personal information collected from you. In such instances, Final Draft, Inc. may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In the situation where sites have an Final Draft, Inc. "look and feel," and you reasonably believe you are on an Final Draft, Inc. site, the site is collecting information in a solely intermediary capacity and does not use personal information for secondary purposes. 

In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users and prevent abuse of our system we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submit to us with information from third party sources. For example, we may supplement your registration information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in our database. 

How your Personal Information is Used  
Final Draft, Inc. collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. As another example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your personal information is also used to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of Final Draft, Inc. and selected third parties if you have so opted to receive such communications. 

Final Draft, Inc. may collect information about the use of the Site; such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. Final Draft, Inc. may use this aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for statistical analysis, marketing or similar promotional purposes. 

Your Choices with Respect to Personal Information  
Final Draft, Inc. recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on this Site. Without your consent, Final Draft, Inc. will not communicate any information to you regarding products, services and special offers available from Final Draft, Inc., although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the services on this Site. Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Final Draft, Inc. will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent. 

There are other instances in which Final Draft, Inc. may divulge your personal information.

Protection of Your Personal Information  
The personal information that you provide in connection with registering yourself as a user of Final Draft, Inc. products or services or registering an Final Draft, Inc. product is classified as Registration Information. Registration Information is protected in several ways. Access by you to your Registration Information is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. In addition, your Registration Information resides on a secure server that only selected Final Draft, Inc. personnel and contractors have access to via password. Final Draft, Inc. encrypts your personal information and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to Final Draft, Inc..

Personal information that you provide that does not constitute Registration Information also resides on a secure server and is only accessible to selected Final Draft, Inc. personnel and contractors via password. Since this information is not accessible by you, you will not be asked to select a password in order to view or modify such information. 

Please note that any information you post to a public bulletin board or chat room, such as the Final Draft, Inc. User to User Forums (the "Forums"), is available to all persons accessing that location. Your email address will not automatically be posted on the Forums unless you modify the default setting to permit that. Your email address would then be available to all persons accessing the Forums. In addition, you should be aware that the Forums offers a service in which subscribers are emailed a copy of all messages posted to the Forums on a particular topic. Consequently, if you post a message to the Forums your email address will be sent to those subscribers that have indicated an interest in the topic of your message.
