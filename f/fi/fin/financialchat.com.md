**Site Usage Information**  
Financial Chat gathers "site usage" information from all visitors to the Financial Chat Web sites.

Individually identifiable information will not be released without that individual's prior consent. Visitors are specifically asked for individually identifiable information when signing up to use certain Financial Chat services, such as the message boards or the live chat membership option.

**Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy** (Users under the age of 13)  
In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with Financial Chat policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:

  * Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; 
  * Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties;
  * Give children the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information;
  * Entice children with the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.
