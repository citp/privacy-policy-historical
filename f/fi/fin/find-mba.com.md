# FIND MBA - Privacy

At FIND MBA we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users.

When you register at FIND MBA, personal information such as your name and e-mail address will be collected via our registration form. We will use this information solely to personalize the content you will see based on your personal preferences and to improve our understanding of our users’ needs in developing FIND MBA. We will not share this information with any third party nor will we allow third parties to send you information to your submitted e-mail address. 

If you choose to send an e-mail to one of the listed institutions at FIND MBA by pushing the “Request Information”-button, you consent to receiving information from the chosen institution. The e-mail you send will be identified as coming from your personal e-mail address and not from FIND MBA. However, the e-mail will contain an introductory statement indicating that you have sent this e-mail through our website.

When visiting FIND MBA, a cookie will be placed on your hard drive. This file allows you to move quickly and easily around our site. It enables us to identify returning users and identify registrants. As a registrant you will have the cookie linked to your e-mail address so that you will not need to login each time you visit. We may also use a cookie to track a user's sessions. We only use this information to find out what site features are most popular so that we can develop FIND MBA accordingly. You can delete cookies from your hard drive at any time. However, once the cookie is deleted, any settings such as your stored username and password will have to be re-entered when you log in again. 

As FIND MBA is visited by users from all over the world, the usage of our website involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Thus, by browsing FIND MBA and communicating electronically with us, you consent to our processing of personal data in this way.
