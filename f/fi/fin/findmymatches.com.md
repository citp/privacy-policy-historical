We may also use your personal information from time to time to send you special offers, new products, services, promotions, and other similar information.

We are able to offer our services to you, in part, because you agree that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 C.F.R. § 310, et seq.
