In order to provide you with information, tools and other services we may collect and retain “Personal Information” that may identify you or contribute to identifying you. “Personal Information” can include information such as your name, email address, your photo, contact details and, in some cases, general financial information. We will not collect your personal information unless it’s necessary to provide the information, advice or service you’ve requested and, where possible, you’ll be able to use our services anonymously.

We will generally only collect your personal information from you or from someone you’ve  to provide it to us. We will also only collect information by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way.

##  **When we collect your information**

When you use our service (or while you’re accessing our services) we may collect personal information about you. Because we take your privacy seriously we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware of:

  * who we are and how you can contact us; and

We provide general advice and comparative information about a range of financial and credit products and can help you connect with businesses that provide relevant products and services. We are often required to collect some personal information to provide some services and, if you choose not to provide this information, then there is a chance that the information or advice you receive may not be suitable.

We prefer to collect personal information about an individual only from that individual but when you use our services you may provide us with personal information about someone else. We won’t ask you for personal information about someone else unless it’s needed to provide you with the service, advice or information you’ve requested but if you provide us with information about another person, you need to ensure that you are to disclose that information to us. It’s your responsibility to ensure that they understand how we will collect, use or disclose the information you provide. You need to take reasonable steps to ensure that they understand that we will not take any additional steps to confirm their understanding of these issues.

 **How we use personal information**

We collect personal information from you to provide you with services, advice and information including

  * answering your general queries about financial products, credit products and related matters;
  * confirming your identity;
  * communicating with you;
  * administering our services;
  * notifying you of the services we offer;
  * carrying out marketing, training or promotional activities;
  * responding to feedback, comments, or any other contact;
  * sending you email(s) or newsletters to which you have subscribed;

  * in marketing, educative and promotional material (and then only with your express permission).



By using our services, you consent to us collecting, holding and using your personal information in this way.

We may also access, hold and use aggregated information about the people that use our services. Aggregated information won’t identify you or any other individual but simply provides us with non-personally identifiable data that we’ll use to improve our services, understand our users’ needs and develop tailored content. Although you would have provided us with the information we aggregate for these purposes, it won’t identify you or enable you to be personally identified.

##  **Where we hold your information**

The information you provide to us – both personal and general information - . The service providers who host our servers are not permitted to access your personal information except for the purposes of storing it. Although we will take reasonable steps to protect the information you provide to us, you should appreciate that the Internet itself is not secure and take care about the personal information that you transfer over the internet or by email.

In a limited number of circumstances we may use third party providers to facilitate surveys or mail outs on our behalf. Should this occur, we will only do so where the Service Provider

  * commits to securing your personal information in a manner consistent with our policy; or
  * 


##  **When we will disclose your information**

As a general principle, we won’t disclose your personal information without your express permission unless

  * we are required to do so by the law, to comply with our obligations or exercise our rights;
  * it’s necessary to lessen or prevent a serious and imminent threat to a person’s health, life or safety;
  *  required to facilitate a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy; or
  * it’s necessary to lessen or prevent a threat to public health or public safety.



##  **How we maintain accurate information**

Although we will take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information we collect,  or disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date, it is your responsibility to ensure that the information you provide to us is accurate, complete and current. You control the information you provide to us and you can correct or update any information you choose to provide to us. If you want us to correct our records simply tell us what needs to be changed and why.

##  **How do we retain and secure your personal information**

We will only ask for the information we need to provide you with services, advice and information you request from us. Where we retain your information, 

Rest assured that we will, and do, take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold and prevent the misuse, loss or  use of the information we hold. We will also take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information . We have implemented  the integrity and security of your information but no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

Although finder maintains a regular plan of recovery in the event of the loss of data stored in relation to products and for the purposes of compliance with internal dispute resolution procedures, we do not routinely store individual personal data except with your express permission. Please be aware that when you engage with us via social media, in a forum or by email you may be providing us with some of your personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers or email addresses. 

We also cannot control the actions of other users or other third parties with whom you may choose to share your information.

##  **We believe in openness**

This document sets out our approach to the management of personal information and we make this available to anyone who asks for it. If you need to know more, we are more than happy to explain to you what sort of personal information we , for what purposes, and how we collect, hold, use and disclose that information.

##  **You can access your information**

If we hold personal information about you, and in many cases we won’t, you can request access to the information we hold. We will not restrict your access to the information unless:

  *   * providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon someone else’s privacy; or
  * the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or
  * the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between you and us;
  * providing access would prejudice our negotiations; or
  * providing access would be unlawful; or
  * denying access is required or  by or under law; or
  * providing access would be prejudicial or commercially sensitive.



If we can’t provide you with access to the information because of one or more of these reasons (which we will confirm in writing) we will consider reasonable alternatives that may satisfy all parties. You’ll generally be able to access your personal information without cost but, if we think a charge is reasonable it will not be excessive and will not apply to lodging a request for access.

##  **You determine how you’re identified**

##  **Where your personal information may end up**

Unless you choose to your personal information, or instruct us to do so, the personal information we hold will be secured on our servers and not be transferred elsewhere. 

  *   *   *   * 


We will not transfer information contrary to this policy, without your consent or in a manner inconsistent with this policy.

##  **How to provide feedback or request access**

We believe in openness and we are committed to ensuring that we respect the privacy of those using the exceptional services we provide. [](mailto:privacy@finder.com), or by mail at 1460 4th St. # 306. Santa Monica, CA. 90401.
