IMPORTANT: BY USING THE SYMPHONY TALENT SITES AND/OR SERVICES AVAILABLE ON THE SITES, YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE SITES OR ACCESS THE SERVICES.

**Scope of this Privacy Policy**

This Policy applies to information we collect on sites owned or controlled by Symphony Talent or its affiliated companies (hereinafter “Symphony Talent”). Affiliated companies are entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Symphony Talent.

If you are using our Sites to look or offer yourself for work, apply for a job, sign up for alerts or other services, participate in a job survey, take a skills assessment, complete a background check, or perform other career-related activities (a “Job Seeker”), we share your information with potential employers, headhunters, recruiters, hiring managers and other human resource professionals (collectively “Recruiter” or “Recruiters”). We are unable to control their use of your data. We also do not control the data practices of those who access your information on or through our Sites, or other third parties with whom we work with to provide Services that you may choose to use.  You may wish to review the privacy policies of those sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.

If you are using our Sites as a Recruiter, we do not control the data practices of third parties with whom we work with to provide Services that you may choose to use, nor parties that you may request we work with to integrate other services and systems you may use.

Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to/from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our Site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to Symphony Talent Sites.

Information collected on our Sites is stored in the United States; therefore, your information is subject to U.S. law.

**Information We Collect**

We collect three types of information when you use our Sites: Personal Information (“PI”), Company Information, and Aggregate Information.

You acknowledge that any and all materials you upload to the Symphony Talent Sites (“Submissions”), are subject to this Privacy Policy.

**_Personal Information:_** This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering, purchasing a product or service, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.

When you use our Sites as a Job Seeker or as a Recruiter, you create a profile, which contains a core set of PI, which acts as a login authentication to identify you (a “Profile”). We store this Profile in the United States.

You use your Profile to access our Services, and you add, update and delete information on your Profile as you use the Services. The Services that you choose to use determines the type of information collected, the use of that information by Symphony Talent and by others, and your control over that information.

For example, your Profile will always contain:

  1. your name;
  2. your email address; and
  3. a password that you set.



Then, depending on the Services you use, we may collect and store in your Profile:

  1. contact information such as address, telephone number;
  2. information about your education and occupation background, skills and experience, awards, memberships and affiliations, activities and interests;
  3. information imported by you and/or your connections from third party sites;
  4. information about third parties, such as references or contacts which you provide to us with the third parties’ express written consent to do so;
  5. your resume, cover letters, patents, work examples and other documents (“Supporting Documents”);
  6. your preferences and favorites; and/or
  7. your age, gender, race or ethnicity, if permitted by local law and you choose to provide it.



Depending on the Services you choose to use, some or all of your Profile may be made available to other parties. Your Password is never shown to any other party.

We attempt to limit access to our Sites to Recruiters, but we do not and cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. Furthermore, we cannot control the use of information in your Profile by third parties who access the Sites. Once your Profile has been disclosed, Symphony Talent is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who have seen, downloaded, printed or otherwise stored it.

Some Services (such as background checks and various new hire on-boarding functions employers may require of you, or your purchasing of other Services we may offer you, etc.), may require that you provide very sensitive information (“Permitted Hidden Information”) such as:

  1. Social Security Number or National Identification Number; and/or
  2. Credit card number and billing information.



Permitted Hidden Information is not stored in, and is not visible in, your Profile. Other than for storage as Permitted Hidden Information, you should not put Social Security Numbers, bank accounts, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in your Profile, Public Submissions, or any Supporting Document.

Some Services allow you to set your Profile, parts of your Profile, your Supporting Documents and some types of Submissions that you make visible to the public areas of Symphony Talent Sites (“Public Submission”). Public Submissions can be seen by any user on the Symphony Talent Sites, and by any person on the Internet. You can retract Public Submissions at any time by adjusting your privacy settings in your profile. However, anyone who has viewed your Profile, including your Public Submissions, may have kept a copy of them.

You may delete your Profile (which deletes your Supporting Documents and Public Submissions), from our Sites at any time. Some Countries and States require that we, and/or Recruiters that use our Services, retain a copy of the information you provided. Deleting your Profile from our Sites does not guarantee that copies of your information are also being deleted.

If you provide us with details of a reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded his or her contact information and has consented in writing for you to do so. By providing the details of a reference, you warrant and represent that you have obtained that individual’s consent.

All Submissions, including but not limited to Profiles, Supporting Documents, or other information you give to us, must not contain information relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin, unless you choose to, and it is legal for you to do so (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical or mental health or biometric details or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offenses or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or (viii) the commission of any unlawful or objectionable conduct and associated penalties. If the information you provide does contain any of the above, then you agree that it is at your own risk. We cannot control third parties’ access to such information as they use our Services.

**_Company Information:_** Your Profile only contains information about you. If you are using our Sites as a Recruiter, you will undertake activities on behalf of your company, (such as posting jobs, writing job descriptions, adding notes, documents, comments, and sending email to Job Seekers, etc.), and these activities create and store information for your company (“Company Information”), that is separate to your Profile.

All Company Information you give to us must not contain information relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin, unless you choose to, and it is legal for you to do so (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical or mental health or biometric details or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offenses or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or (viii) the commission of any unlawful or objectionable conduct and associated penalties. If the information you provide does contain any of the above, then you agree that it is at your own risk. We cannot control third parties’ access to such information as they use our Services.

If you delete your Profile, Company Information that you may have added as a Recruiter may or may not be deleted depending on the company’s agreement with Symphony Talent, and the various legal laws pertaining to data storage.

**_Aggregate Information:_** This refers to information that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Sites and what other sites may have directed you to us. We automatically collect information about how you use our Sites, the areas of our Sites that you visit, as well as information about your computer or mobile device including your IP address, device ID, physical location, browser and operating system type, screen size and referring URLs. This information is necessary for providing personalized and location-based content as well as for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, preventing fraud, and improving our Services. We may combine this information with information in your Profile to help prevent fraud, or to improve the value and relevant outcome of the services you use.

If you choose to login, add, or otherwise connect with LinkedIn, Facebook or other such similar social network sites (“Social Information”), you authorize us to import and/or show the Social Information that you choose to share with us as part of your Profile, and use that information in the aggregate.

Our Sites also let you share your Profile publicly; such that your Profile may be accessed by everyone on the Internet, including users without accounts, and your Profile may also appear in public search engine results. You may control the visibility of your information by managing your privacy settings. You may also restrict the information available to others by turning off and/or deleting information you do not want visible, or by not providing the information at all.

**How We Use Information**

We use the information we collect to provide our Services, operate and improve our Sites, and respond to you.

**How You Update and/or Delete your Information**

Depending on what Services you use, you may be able to access, update or delete your information in different ways.  For instance, some services such as Background Checks delivered by third parties may be legally required to keep your information for a period of time.

1) If you had taken an Assessment as part of applying for a job with a specific company via the SkillCheck.com website, you need to [Contact Us](http://www.findly.com/contact/) in order to have your assessment results deleted from that system.

2) If you had applied to a job for a specific employer via the HRApply.com system, you need to visit that employer’s career website to log in and delete your profile.

If you wish to delete or close your account and remove your Profile altogether, you can do so at any time by visiting [https://www.TheHive.com](https://www.thehive.com/). If you delete your Profile we will retain an archival copy of your Profile that is not accessible by you or third parties. Archival copies are retained only for as long as needed for audit and record purposes, and/or by law (“Archival Period”). We will also keep logs and information that may relate to your activity on our Site.

If you wish to re-establish your Profile during the Archival Period, you may re-join our Sites, and providing you use and authenticate with the same email address as you originally used to create your Profile, your full Profile and history will be restored, minus your Name, Address, Phone number, and any Permitted Hidden Information you may have previously added. You may re-add this information.

**How We Store Information**

We retain all the aggregate non-identifying information we gather about you in an effort to make your, and other’s use of our Sites more efficient. We keep this non-identifying information even if you delete your Profile.

We may retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

If you change your Profile, those changes will be provided to any party that accesses your Profile through our Sites and Services, provided they still maintain your consent to disclose your Profile to them.

While you are able to change and delete your Profile from our Sites, anyone who previously had your consent or otherwise viewed your Profile and/or used our Sites may have kept a copy of it. Some Countries and States require that we, and/or Recruiters that use our Services, retain a copy of the information you provided as you used the Services. Deleting and/or changing your Profile from/on our Sites does not guarantee that these copies are also being deleted/changed.

Upon request we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If you have additional requests regarding your information, please [contact us by clicking here](http://www.findly.com/contact/). Symphony Talent will respond to information access requests within thirty (30) days of receipt. If we require additional time to respond, we will acknowledge receipt of your request within a reasonable timeframe and supplement our response within the time period required by applicable law.

If you have not logged onto our Site for an extended period, we may deactivate your Profile. You can reactivate your Profile simply by logging back in to any of our Sites within the Archival Period. Deactivated Profiles may be deleted. Our policy is to delete accounts and Profiles if a user does not log in within eighteen (18) months. We may extend or reduce this period at our discretion. If we change the period, we will update this notice. We will notify you at the email address you provided before we delete your account in this manner.

**Information Collected on Behalf of our Clients**

The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Symphony Talent.

Symphony Talent collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.

**Security**

Symphony Talent takes measures we believe to be appropriate to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the Symphony Talent Sites cannot be guaranteed.

They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process your order. When you place an order online at Symphony Talent, your credit card information is encrypted with industry standard encryption (SSL). This makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted.
