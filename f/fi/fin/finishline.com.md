Analytical cookies also may be used to analyze how you interact with other websites and mobile applications.
  

  * **We use first-party cookies and third-party cookies**. First-party cookies are set by us on our Site and App and can only be used to capture information about your use of the Site or App. Third-party cookies may be set by our Providers on our Site or App. For example, we may hire a third-party analytics company that sets their own cookie to our Site to perform web performance analytics services for us.

These social media tools may be hosted by a third party. Your interactions with these tools and the corresponding social media platforms are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide such platforms.

Click [HERE](http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/) to learn about the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices app, a tool for opting out of the collection of cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising by participating service providers. You may download the AppChoices app [HERE](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appchoices/id894822870) for iOS devices and [HERE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DAA.appchoices) for Android devices. You can stop all further collection of information by or via our App by uninstalling our App. You may use the standard uninstall process available as part of your mobile device or through the mobile application marketplace or network. _If you uninstall our App from your mobile device, a unique identifier we used that was associated with your device may continue to be stored. If you re-install our App on the same mobile device, we may be able to re-associate this unique identifier to your prior transactions and activities._

If you have registered an account on our Site or on our App, you may access and update certain Personal Information that you have provided us by logging into your account and making such changes. If you update your account or if you request we deactivate your account, we may not delete residual copies from our servers and may not remove information associated with the prior version(s) or deactivated account.

**Our Security Practices**. We use a variety of administrative, contractual, technical and physical controls and safeguards to help protect your Customer Information from loss and unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, destruction or similar risks. However, no control or safeguard can completely guarantee that such information is completely secure. As a matter of policy, we do not disclose details regarding our security measures as this could be beneficial information to criminals and other bad actors. 

  
**Your Security Practices**. You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized disclosure or use.

We encourage you to take steps to help protect the confidentiality and security of your account and Personal Information, including by doing the following:

  * Review your Finish Line account periodically and immediately report any unexpected activity or unrecognized information
  * Install the latest security updates and antivirus software on your computer to help prevent malware and viruses
  * Use complex passwords and not using the same password on more than one Site
  * Password protect your computer and mobile device
  * Do not share your passwords with others
  * Sign out/log off Site sessions to close your session



You may come into contact with emails, texts or mobile alerts that look like they originate from us asking for your Personal Information. For your protection, do not respond to such communications or click on links or open any files attached to such suspicious, unsolicited communications. If you receive such a communication, please email onlinefraud@finishline.com immediately so that we may investigate the suspicious activity.

We provide our Services in the United States and in U.S. Territories (Puerto Rico and Guam). Customer Information we collect is primarily stored in the United States. If you live outside of the United States or U.S. Territory, by using our Services, you understand and agree that we may transfer your Personal Information to and within the United States. Our Site is subject to U.S. laws, which may not provide the same level of protections as those laws in your country.

**Third Party Links**. If we offer you a link to connect to a third-party website, it is for your convenience. Third-party websites linked to and from our Site, App and Internet Marketing Platforms are not necessarily under our control and we have no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any such linked website or service. We recommend you read the privacy policies of those parties to understand how your information is handled, processed or shared. In addition, you may have visited our Site or App through a link or banner advertisement on another website or mobile application. In these cases, the website you linked from may collect information from you if click on the link or banner advertisement. You may want to refer to the privacy policies of the operators of those websites or banner advertisements to understand how your information is handled, processed or shared. 

  
**Do Not Track Signals**. Some browsers offer a “Do Not Track” privacy preference. Generally, when a user turns on the Do Not Track Signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. Our Site, App and Internet Marketing Platforms currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals. However, you have other options for opting out of tracking for interest-based advertising purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.

  
**Privacy of Children Under 13**. You must be 13 years old or older to submit Personal Information to us, including to register an account or place an order on the Site or App. Our Site, App and other Services are intended for a general audience and are not targeted to or intended for use by children. While we sell shoes, apparel and accessories for children, these products are intended to be purchased by adults. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from persons under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us so that we can take steps to delete his or her Personal Information.

By using our Services, you consent to your Customer Information collected by us or our third party service providers to be transferred outside your country of residence to countries or jurisdictions where we or our affiliates may have business operations or to engage third parties to provide services to us for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Such countries may not have the same level of data protection as within your country. If we do make such a transfer, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure your Customer Information is protected. 

From time to time, we may change our Privacy Policy and may apply any changes to Customer Information previously collected, as permitted by law. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically so that you are aware of our current privacy practices. When we make material changes to our privacy policies and practices, we will notify you by posting the updated Privacy Policy on our website with an updated effective date at the start of the Policy. However, when we make material changes to our privacy policies and practices around interest-based advertising, we will obtain your consent before applying such change to your data collected before the change. If you do not provide such consent, data collected before the material change will continue to be governed by the policy in effect at the time the information was collected.
