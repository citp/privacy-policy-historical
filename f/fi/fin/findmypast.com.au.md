# Privacy Policy | findmypast.com.au

We send service emails to you to administer the service. Service emails include registration and payment confirmations and emails that provide useful information about how to use a service or feature when you sign up or start using it. We will also send you a service email if we make a fundamental change to the website, or to our terms & conditions that we think we need to make you aware of, or to let you know important information about your account.

We use your email address to update you on new products, services and subscription offers. We will only contact you with your consent. You are entitled to withhold this consent and refrain from receiving such communications by selecting the appropriate option on the web form that collects your details. You can also update these options at any time by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences, by contacting us by email at support@findmypast.com.au, by calling +44 (0)20 3326 6300 [UK, IE, AU] / +1 (855) 246-8234 [US] or by post to Findmypast, 6 Chapel Place, Rivington Street, London EC2A 3DQ. We will always provide you with a way of opting out of receiving future marketing messages from us each time we send them to you.

The impact of this will depend on what information you withhold, but the main impacts may be:

  * We will not be able to process or fully process your order.
  * We will not be able to contact you to let you know of problems regarding your order or the goods/services provided.
  * We will not be able to respond fully to requests and queries you may have.
  * We cannot personalise the service you receive. So, if you are online you will have to search more for the content type you normally view or for similar/related products.
  * We won’t be able to limit online adverts to products or services you have shown interest in and so you may receive adverts that are not related to your interests.

  


### 5\. What grounds (legal basis) are we processing the data under?

There are a number of grounds we process your data under. These are:

  * Contractual – we need the information to perform the contract for goods or services you have requested/ordered including payment, delivery etc.
  * Legal – should we be legally required to contact you concerning a purchase or service.
  * Legitimate interest – this means the processing is in Findmypast’s interest. It allows us to manage the customer relationship effectively and efficiently and improve the goods and/or services we provide by better understanding how our online provisions are used and which goods are popular with which groups of individuals.
  * Consent – where you have given us consent to market to you.

  


### 6\. Information stored in your family tree

Everyone has the right to request to be removed from the Community Shared Tree regardless of who added their name to the tree. For example, if a relative no longer wants to be apart of the Community Shared Tree and requests to be removed. Findmypast and FamilySearch will suppress that tree node. It will remain on the tree as private and only viewable to the individual who created the node. Requests to be removed from the public Community Shared Tree can be directed to FamilySearch’s Customer Support team at support@familysearch.org.

**Who can see the information?**

This marks your contribution to the tree and encourages accuracy.

When you choose through your Findmypast privacy setting to keep the tree information you add to the Community Shared Tree set to ‘private’ then the names of living individuals added by you to the shared, global tree will remain private to you after the point a future ability to share other such information becomes available. Such information you choose to keep private will not be viewed by any other Findmypast or global FamilySearch users.

### 7\. Record matching

Findmypast uses record matching technologies to suggest possible matches between historical records on Findmypast and associated partner trees on Family Historian or Roots Magic.

Record matching on Findmypast automatically matches historical records for your family tree. These records are pulled from our vast records database Record matching will save you time with your research and allow you to make fascinating discoveries through historical records such as birth, marriage and death documents and census records. Our historical records are gathered from a number of key partners around the world. More information about our record partners is available on [Our Partners page](https://www.findmypast.com.au/content/our-partners).

When record matching is enabled within partner sites such as Family Historian, Roots Magic, or other Desktop Software partners, information from small parts of your family tree is passed between the sites without you having to do anything, to a matching service on the Findmypast website. This information includes basic information such as names, dates and places associated with individuals and their close relatives. Findmypast uses this data to find accurate matches for relevant individuals. The matching service provides partner site users with suggested matches of ancestors’ birth, marriage, and death records. We will also provide matches for census records. As a Findmypast customer, you can then add these records to your tree. The service will match against living relatives.

Please note this information is not retained by Findmypast and is deleted automatically after matches are calculated and displayed to you. Only partner site users receive Findmypast hints. Findmypast users do not receive hints about trees on the partner site.

The partner site will show matches in its search window where matches are found. To find out more about these matches, follow the links provided and review them. You will then be able to accept or reject matches. Please note that some matches can be viewed and confirmed for free, while others require a Findmypast data subscription. In order to review these matches, you will need to subscribe to Findmypast and create an account.

The information passed to Findmypast is never used for any other purpose and will never be displayed, sold, licensed or used in any manner whatsoever. If you have any question or concerns, you can email support@findmypast.com.au or call Customer Support on +44(0)20 3326 6300 [UK, IE, AU] +1 (855) 246-8234 [US]
