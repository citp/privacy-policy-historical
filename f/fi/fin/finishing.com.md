### Regarding information that you supply on forms

**Name, city, & State**: Finishing.com is a place of camaraderie for people with metal finishing interests. Therefore we are NOT an anonymous service. When you post an inquiry or response, we require and print your full name, city, and state--like a newspaper or magazine would. If we realize that you are a minor, we don't print your last name. After your posting is no longer current, we will delete your last name upon request.

**E-mail address:** We also require your e-mail address. We don't print it except in special circumstances where you request it. Please do not disguise your e-mail address because we can't print your posting until an auto-reply confirms that your e-mail address works.

**Company name:** We do not require your company name. We print it only if you choose (and then only if we choose).

**What information do we make available to others?** We do not compile, maintain, or sell any mailing lists. However, this is an advertiser-supported site, and many visitors are looking for suppliers. So, on a one-contact-at-a-time basis, we do pass along the contact information for a specific inquiry to an advertiser who wishes to respond to you. When we do so, we attach the following instruction-- 
    \-------  
PRIVACY NOTICE: This contact info is forwarded to you under the terms agreed to by the inquirer who provided it. You may respond to THIS SPECIFIC INQUIRY but you may not add this contact information to any database, send any unsolicited offerings of any type to the inquirer, nor pass this contact info to any third party. 
    \------- 

### **Regarding information that is available without you deliberately supplying it**

**IP Address Capture:** Please remember that you are never anonymous on the Internet! Your IP address is always available. Finishing.com captures the IP address when someone fills in a form on our site, clicks on a banner ad, or links to an external site. 
     
    Why? We are a commercial website which can only exist with the support of our advertisers. Visitors can conveniently visit our site and 'click-thru' to our advertisers' sites from finishing.com without any need for registration here -- so we need to be able to show that our site is directing the visitors to them.   
It is also necessary to capture IP address in log files as part of our defense against spammers and attackers.
** **
**Cookies:** Finishing.com does not use 'cookies' internally. That is, we do not make automated attempts to track which pages or sites a particular visitor has or has not accessed, how frequently they have visited, etc. We do not keep logs of that nature. However, when you click on a banner or link that takes you to another site, that link may include 'tracking code' to tell that site that you came from finishing.com, and the external site may save info about you. 
     
As one example, **Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site**. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 
     
     

### Regarding Scams

If you submit an offer which gives us reasonable grounds for suspicion that it is part of an illegal scam (Nigerian 419 letters, 'black money' offers, 'cleaning chemicals for defaced bills', 'copper-iridium rice pulling items') we may forward it to the authorities without notice

### Complaints

If you feel that anyone has spammed you through info available from this site, please let us know. Thanks!
