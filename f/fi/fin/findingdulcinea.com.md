### Web Beacons 

We employ or our third party advertising partner employ Web beacons that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are clear gifs (tiny graphics) with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.

We use Web beacons in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Newsletters". 

### Third Party Advertisers

Dulcinea Media uses trusted and reputable other advertising companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our Web site. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file.  We only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you.

If you want to opt-out of third party ad network cookies, you may do so through the [Network Advertising Initiative.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)
