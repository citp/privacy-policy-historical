All users who receive an ad served at the Find A Grave website retain complete anonymity where Find A Grave is concerned. As ads are delivered, Find A Grave and its advertisers do not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. Find A Grave does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. Find A Grave servers note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of site statistics generation, targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness. Please note that this policy applies to all webpages served within the findagrave.com domain as well as the auxillary domains including findagrave.org, findagrave.net, cemeteryrecords.com, cemeteryrecordsonline.com and remembermyfamily.com. The policy does not extend to any site or sites that a user may navigate to should the user exit the Find A Grave website by clicking on an advertisement or other link. Intentional misuse of the Find A Grave website voids this privacy statement. Intentional misuse includes but is not limited to posting illicit images, posting information or images known to be inaccurate and posting offensive or inflammatory 'virtual flowers'.
