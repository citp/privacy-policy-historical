You can set your browser not to accept cookies. However, in a few cases, some of the features on our Website may not function as a result. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to the Website. 

We advise that all Members and/or Subscribers should take the following precautions when meeting or corresponding with anyone on any dating or social networking website: 

  * Anyone capable of identity theft can also falsify a dating profile; 

  * There is really no substitute for acting with caution when interacting with any stranger or Member and/or Subscriber who wants to meet you; 

  * You should never share your personal details: last name, email address, home address, phone number, place of work, or any other identifying information in your dating profile or initial email messages. We do our best to police the site for potential fraud and scam artists. We advise you to stop communicating with anyone that pressures you for personal or financial information; and 

  * If you decide to meet face-to-face with another Member and/or Subscriber, you should always tell a close friend or family member where you are going and when you are expected to return. Never agree to be picked up at your home. Always be in control of the situation, provide your own transportation to and from your meeting and meet in a public place with many people around. 




Although we do our best to monitor findmelove.com and our affiliates’ content, we cannot guarantee that all material used has consent prior to publication. If you feel that any content should be removed from our site, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

**Where we store your personal data**

The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a location outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff located outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers (for example, staff who are involved in providing Services that you order from us, processing your payment details or providing support services for the Website). By submitting your personal data to us through the Website, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
