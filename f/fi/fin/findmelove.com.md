Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to the Site.

We advise that all members should take the following precautions when meeting or corresponding with anyone on any dating or social networking website: 

(1) Anyone capable of identity theft can also falsify a dating profile; 

(2) There is really no substitute for acting with caution when interacting with any stranger/member who wants to meet you; 

(3) You should never share your personal details. Last name, email address, home address, phone number, place of work, or any other identifying information in your dating profile or initial email messages. We do our best to police the site for potential fraud and scam artists, we advise you to stop communicating with anyone that pressures you for personal or financial information; and 

(4) If you decide to meet face-to-face with another member, you should always tell a close friends of family member where you are going and when you are expected to return. Never agree to be picked up at your home. Always be in control of the situation, provide your own transportation to and from your date and meet in a public place with many people around.
