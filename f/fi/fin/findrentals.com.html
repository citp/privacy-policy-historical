            <h1>FindRentals.com Customer Privacy Policy</h1><p>

                The FindRentals.com Customer Privacy Policy has been developed
                as an extension of our commitment to combine the finest quality
                products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing
                with our customers. The Policy guides how we collect, store and
                use information about customers and prospects, and it will be
                periodically assessed against new technologies, business practices
                and our customers' changing needs. The FindRentals.com site may,
                from time to time, modify this Customer Privacy Policy to reflect
                legal, technological and other developments. In that event the
                changes will appear at this location. Our Policy recognizes two
                kinds of personal data that deserve varying levels of protection.
                Personally-Identifiable Information includes, for example, e-mail
                addresses, billing information, employment status and "click stream"
                data that tracks user activity on a Web site or online service. FindRentals.com
                is committed to using all reasonable efforts to abide by the following
                Policy statement:<br>
                <br>
                <b>Collection.</b><br>
                <br>
                Personally-Identifiable Information will only be collected to
                the extent that FindRentals.com deems reasonably necessary to
                serve a legitimate business purpose. Please be aware that if you
                disclose Personally-Identifiable Information on Website, that
                information may be collected and used by third parties without
                our knowledge and may result in unsolicited communications from
                third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of FindRentals.com.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Security.</b><br>
                <br>
                Appropriate safeguards will be implemented to ensure the security,
                integrity and privacy of Personally-Identifiable Information about
                our customers and prospects. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Access.</b><br>
                <br>
                Review and correction. Procedures have been developed through
                which customers and prospects can, upon request, review and correct
                the Personally-Identifiable Information that has been collected
                from them by FindRentals.com. These procedures may not, however,
                compromise the security, integrity and privacy of either FindRentals.com
                own proprietary databases or databases licensed from third party
                companies.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Questions and comments?</b><br>
                <br>
                The FindRentals.com Customer Privacy Policy has been developed
                out of respect for the privacy preferences and choices of our
                customers and prospects. We have established procedures to ensure
                that every reasonable effort is made to address your concerns.
                Each business unit within FindRentals.com has designated a Privacy
                Official to implement our Customer Privacy Policy for its respective
                customers and prospects. You should find contact information on
                each of our business unit's Web sites that collect data from you.
