This Policy also explains how we protect the security and confidentiality of your personal information and personally identifiable information. 

The phrases "personal information" or "personally identifiable information" mean any information by which you can be identified including your name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security Number and other information.

**Information We Collect**  
In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, we collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, which allows us to track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individuals remain anonymous unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. 

However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this Site (for example, by making a purchase), we may link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described below. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we may share portions of our server logs -- which contain visitors’ IP addresses -- with the appropriate investigative and/or law enforcement authorities who may use that information to trace and identify individuals. 

**Information You Volunteer**  
We collect the personal information that you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use this Site, for example, the information you provide when you request information about products or services, request a catalog, purchase a product or service, apply for credit, contact us regarding a purchase, or enter a contest or promotion. This information may include your name, shipping/billing address, email address, phone number, credit card information, Social Security Number, birth date, gender, occupation and personal interests and information used to verify your identity or for fraud prevention purposes. Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products, or access certain services, offers and content on our website. 

**Information Provided by Third Parties**  
When you apply for credit on this Site, we will collect personal information from credit bureaus. And when you use a credit card on this Site, we may use a third party to process your credit card. The third party will inform us whether your credit card has been accepted, so that we can complete your transaction. 

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
We use "cookies," and similar technologies, such as Web Beacons (also referred to as "GIF files," "pixels," or "action tags"), to collect personal information and support the functionality of this Site. For more information about our use of cookies and Web Beacons, see below.

Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products and services to suit your personal interests, estimate our audience size and to process your order, track your status in our promotions, contests and sweepstakes, and/or analyze your visiting patterns. Using cookies permits us to provide you with a more personalized shopping experience, provide appropriate website security and, in some cases, may save you the trouble of re-entering information already in our database. 

You can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. You may also delete our cookies as soon as you leave our Site. Although you are not required to accept our cookies, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this Site including managing site security for your individual protection and being able to purchase products and services on this Site. 

We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends and customize the message and delivery of online banner ads based on your online behavior.

Web Beacons help us recognize a unique cookie on your browser. We use this tool to compile aggregate information about you, and it is not personally identifiable. This information includes IP addresses, search terms, domain names, and browser types. We use this information to track usage and other patterns on our website. We may share this aggregate information with our Marketing Partners or Service Providers to provide you with additional information about things that may be of interest to you or to enhance your shopping experience. 

**Using Information About You**  
We use the personal information you provide for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking your order, subscription or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers, and providing you with information from and about Fingerhut. 

From time to time we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy. These are known as our Marketing Partners. In such cases we might share and cross-reference information, including some personally identifiable information about you, to enable such persons or entities to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you. We only share the information we believe is appropriate to enable the Marketing Partners to carry out their responsibilities under our contracts, and we require that the information be used only for the specifically authorized purpose and that its confidentiality be maintained. 

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online or through our catalogs. We may also combine that information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross-reference with our Marketing Partners. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes. 

We may contract with companies or persons to provide certain services including credit card processing, shipping, data management, collections processing, promotional services, etc. We call them our Service Providers. We provide our Service Providers with the information needed for them to perform these services. We may disclose some of your personally identifiable information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may seek to cause injury to you, to Fingerhut or to others. We will disclose your personally identifiable information when required to by law through properly served subpoena if we believe it necessary. 

**Email Privacy**  
Email is not a secure means of communication under most circumstances. Never provide sensitive personal information (i.e. SSN, driver's license number or third party credit card information) to us via email. Use the appropriate website secured websites to communicate this information or contact us by telephone with your customer number. 

Fingerhut will not sell, trade, share or rent the email address you provide to Fingerhut to anyone. We believe that your email address is personal and should be kept that way. We use your email address to provide you with better customer support, and to update you on Internet specials that you have requested.

Sending us such a request will not remove you from our mailing or calling lists for purposes of your credit account and the proper management of the payment and purchases under that account. 

We will respond to reasonable requests within a reasonable time but please note that sometimes these requests may take up to 6-8 weeks to be effective, particularly if we are removing your name from postal mailings.

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard your personal information. While Fingerhut makes best efforts to protect all customer data provided to us, no data transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed 100% secure.
