<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This agreement was last revised on June 22, 2014</p>

<p>Generally FindSimilar.com ("Site" or "we", "our" or "us") does not collect, store, use or disclose any data collected with an intention to personally identify and/or contact a person such as: name, address, telephone number or e-mail address (hereinafter "PII") except in specific instances, for example, when you provide PII through registering on the Site or as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Whenever we collect such PII, it will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>FindSimilar.com provides a comparison shopping service that enables consumers to compare prices, products and stores when they shop online. This service is provided by FindSimilar.com which is owned by Web Monsters Ltd. ("Web Monsters Ltd"). For FindSimilar.com, privacy is a top priority and we provide this Privacy Policy to outline our practices and procedures with respect to information collection and use to enable you to make an informed decision about sharing information with us.</p>

<h2>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by us.</p>

<p>Please be aware that, as part of the service provided by this Site, we may provide links to websites operated by third parties. We are not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party Web sites or applications. You should check the applicable privacy policies of such third-party Web sites or applications to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.</p>

<h2>What information does FindSimilar.com collect and how is it used?</h2>

<p>We may collect any or all of the following three types of information: (i) traffic or clickstream data, (ii) non-personally identifiable information (for example: IP address, browser types, operating systems, domain names, access dates and times, referring website addresses, online transactions and browsing and search activity) ("Non-PII"), and/or (iii) PII in the instances as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Our collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties or subsidiaries or affiliates of Web Monsters Ltd ("Web Monsters Ltd Entities") or with third parties.</p>

<p><strong><u>(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data ("Clickstream Data")</u>.</strong> Clickstream Data consists of traffic and usage data that is not personally identifiable. We do not supplement or combine Clickstream Data with any PII. We may share Clickstream Data we collect with certain selected third parties and Web Monsters Ltd Entities, but only in anonymous form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such third parties and Web Monsters Ltd Entities may combine such Clickstream Data with any PII that you choose to give to such third parties or Web Monsters Ltd Entities when registering with their websites. We collect Clickstream Data regarding use of our services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) you access. For example, our servers collect information about the site to which you may redirect to in order to enable us to calculate and receive payments from our business partners. In addition, we may use Clickstream Data to better design our services.</p>

<p><strong><u>(b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u>.</strong> As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all users of the Site, we may use log files, web beacons and cookies to collect Non-PII from the Site, browsers, advertisers and third-party sites. "Log files" track actions occurring on the Site and collect data including: your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed. "Web beacons" are electronic files used to track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior. "Cookies" are files (e.g. HTTP cookies) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes your computer, device, handheld device or PDA). Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct click-through destination. We may use Cookies for purposes which may include, without limitation, to estimate the total reach of any of our advertisers, how frequently you return to the Site, as well as to streamline experiences of users of our Site. Cookies are also an anonymous way to survey how we are doing and to look for ways to improve our services. All information collected by Cookies, Web beacons and Log files are Non-PII.</p>

<p>There are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system: (i) "Session Cookies" may be used only during your visit to the Site and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii) "Persistent Cookies" (if applicable) remain on your browser for two (2) years from your last visit to the Site and enable us to remember you on subsequent visits to the Site and provide more relevant content to you on such Site.</p>

<p>There are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. We do not use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer.</p>

<p>A useful resource on understanding Cookies may be found at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</a></p>

<p><strong><u>(c) Advertising and Third Party Advertising</u>.</strong> We have relationships with our affiliated companies and with third-party advertising companies to drive traffic to and to serve ads on our Site. We share Clickstream Data and Non-PII with such companies. Such companies may also collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of Cookies and other technology and any personally identifiable information you may choose to give in registering and transacting with any website linked to such ads. The Non-PII collected by such parties on our Site and other websites may be used in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>. Although we choose our business partners and clients carefully, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of these third-party advertisers to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.</p>

<p><strong><u>(d) Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information</u>.</strong> We have access to your PII, including but not limited to first and last name, home or other physical address, telephone number, or email address, after such PII has been submitted to us by: (i) becoming a registered user of our Site, (ii) subscribing to any of our newsletters, (iii) contacting us by submitting a comment, problem, or request for information, (iv) submitting PII in connection with special offers or contests, and/or by (v) signing up as one of our advertisers, merchants or business partners.</p>

<p>PII provided in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests. This information is not stored or used in connection with Clickstream Data and is provided to a third party only as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request of as required by law or court order.</p>

<p>Finally, from time to time, but only with your permission, we may provide your PII to selected third parties who wish to participate in special promotions offered in conjunction with us.</p>

<h2>Is data stored by FindSimilar.com secure?</h2>

<p>We employ reasonable measures to ensure the security of all information and we routinely evaluate our practices to identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our services. No transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this risk when communicating with us.</p>

<p>We use reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose PII from children under the age of 13. The services are not targeted at children, and children age 13 and under may not register for any portions of the services that require registration. If you believe your child has provided us with any PII data by registering on our Site, please specify this issue and <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2>How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about me?</h2>

<p>To request a copy of any PII you have sent to us, please send an email containing your request through this link <a class="feedback {'url':'contact'}" href="javascript:;">contact us</a>. You must provide your full name and the e-mail from which the request is received (and to which the response will be sent) must match the e-mail on file with us. You may then correct or delete such information using the procedures specified in the e-mail.</p>

<h2>How can I learn about changes to this privacy policy?</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and the date the Privacy Policy was last updated on this page so that you are aware of the changes. It is the express will of the parties that this agreement and all related documents have been drawn up in English.</p>
