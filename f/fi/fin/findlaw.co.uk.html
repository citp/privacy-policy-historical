   <a name="collectanduse" title=""></a><h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES FINDLAW COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?</h3>
    <p>We collect information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our web-server logs, and through cookies. We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalised Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. We don't share any of the information you provide with others, unless we say so in this Privacy Statement, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
    <h3>User-Supplied Information</h3> 
<p>When you register for our services or order products via our site, we ask you to provide some personal information, for example, your name, address, phone number, email address, payment card information, and/or certain additional categories of information resulting from use of our websites and services, such as research requests. We keep this information in a contact database for future reference, as needed. We may use certain information you provide to offer you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. If you don't wish to receive such offers, you may opt out (unsubscribe) as described below.</p>

If you submit any Sensitive Information, you do so at your own risk and we will not be liable to you or responsible for consequences of your submission.</p>
    <p>Websites that FindLaw hosts for law firm and lawyer customers may allow you to submit information to the law firm via a contact form or online chat.  Any information that you voluntarily submit through the site may be shared with and stored by FindLaw so that FindLaw may provide services to the law firm or lawyer.  FindLaw will not share this information with third parties unless we say so in this Privacy Statement.   Further, any information submitted through a FindLaw customer’s website may be collected/used by the law firm or lawyer and subject to that law firm or lawyer’s privacy policy.

We use cookies to help remind us who you are and to help you navigate our sites during your visits.

You should understand that some features of many sites may not function properly if you don't accept cookies.</p>

<p>We may use services hosted by third parties to assist in providing our services and to help us understand our customers' use of our products. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web-page request, including your IP address or cookies.

Also, we store the information about you in a data centre with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus-protection software. <strong>However, please note that we cannot guarantee that unauthorised persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures.</strong></p>
    <p>Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in systems located outside your home country, including outside the European Union.
