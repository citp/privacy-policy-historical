   <a name="collectanduse" title=""></a><h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES FINDLAW COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?</h3>
    <p>We collect information about our users in three ways: directly from the user, from our web-server logs, and through cookies. We use the information primarily to provide you with a personalised Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you.

We keep this information in a contact database for future reference, as needed. We may use certain information you provide to offer you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.

Also, we store the information about you in a data centre with restricted access and appropriate monitoring, and we use a variety of technical security measures to secure your data. In addition, we use intrusion detection and virus-protection software. <strong>However, please note that we cannot guarantee that unauthorised persons will always be unable to defeat our security measures.</strong></p>
    <p>Also, please note that we may store and process your personal information in systems located outside your home country, including outside the European Union.
