# FindA New Zealand Privacy Policy

[Home](https://web.archive.org/) » Privacy Policy

FindA has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This document discloses our information gathering and usage practices. For additional information about FindA, please review our Terms and Conditions. 

## Use of your information

FindA does not sell or rent your personal identification to third parties. 

We release account and other personal information only when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of FindA Limited, our users, or others. 

## Email

It is the policy of FindA to send our members email throughout the listing process and other email they elect to receive, in addition to customary business communications (payment confirmations, etc.). Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, FindA may send a regular newsletter to members. Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list. 

We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to email us with your questions or comments. 

## Emailing Tools

FindA provides facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to FindA or to send references to a specific listing or product to a friend. You may not use the "Email This Link to a Friend" service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our privacy policy or Terms and Conditions. We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email messages or the email addresses. 

## Membership Registration

Our site's registration form requires you to provide us contact information and may also require demographic information. We may use your contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our affiliated partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. 

## Updating Your Personal Information

FindA provides you with ways in which you can alter your personal data, including changing your email address, password, phone number, etc. FindA will store previous email addresses against your profile to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions - specifically the use of one account per member. 

## Control of Your Password.
