Financial Engines Privacy Policy
Effective September 27, 2012
We believe that the privacy and security of your data are essential. This statement summarizes
Financial Engines' policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of the personal
information you entrust to us.
What personal information of mine is collected?
Financial Engines collects information from you during your use of our service. If your
retirement plan sponsor or administrator or other financial institution makes our service available
to you, it may provide us with information about you and your account to facilitate our ability to
provide our services to you and to reduce the amount of data you need to enter. The information
we collect may include but is not limited to your name, age, salary, financial account information
including financial institution, account balances and contributions, investment holdings and
preferences, and contact information.
We keep records of our advisory service, which may include but are not limited to records of the
advice that we provide to you, your use of our services, and your communications to us about
our services.
If your access allows you to purchase a subscription, we may ask for your credit card and billing
information.
We collect data in our log files. This data may include your IP address, browser type, domain
name, the length of time of your visit, and the number of times you visit. We use this information
to gather aggregate demographic information that helps us to provide you with services and
information that are relevant to you. We keep this information for our internal use; we do not
share it with others.
How is my information used?
Your personal, investment and forecast information are maintained by Financial Engines to
provide you with your services and to fulfill our legal and regulatory requirements. By having
more information about you, we are better able to customize our services to your particular
situation.
Data that does not include personally identifiable information may be used for academic research
or other research purposes. For instance, we may compile data, excluding personally identifiable
information, for purposes of demographic analysis and research.

Also, if you choose to respond to voluntary surveys which you may receive from time to time,
any information you provide will be used in the manner specified.
How is my information protected?
We follow specific policies and procedures to maintain the confidentiality of your personal
information. We maintain extensive physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect
your information.
With whom is my information shared?
Financial Engines will not sell, reveal or share any of your personally identifiable information to
others except in the following limited circumstances:
      • We have your permission to share the information;
      • We need to share your information with companies who work on our behalf to
         provide a product or service to you or to maintain or service your account (for example
         with a financial institution to execute transactions, or with a mailing service company to
         send communications to you; unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have
         any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what
         is necessary to assist us); or
      • We are required or authorized by law to disclose your information (for example, to
         comply with a subpoena or regulatory requirement, or to protect against fraud or illegal
         activity).
What are cookies and how are they used?
Cookies are small amounts of data that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on
your computer’s local storage. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying
information. Instead, the information they provide is in the form of aggregate statistics. They
may be used to determine audience size, measure traffic patterns, analyze clickstreams, or help
keep your session secure. If you do not wish to receive cookies, most Internet browsers allow
you to turn cookies off so that you do not receive them. If you do turn your cookies off, you will
not be able to use some services or features.
What choices are available to me regarding use of my information?
On occasion, we may use your e-mail address to inform you of products or services that we
believe may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive future communications from us,
you may update your communications preferences in the Online Advice service. You can also
contact Financial Engines Investor Support at support@financialengines.com, and we will
remove you from our e-mail list. However, even if you do choose not to receive e-mails from us,

we may be required to send emails when necessary to comply with our legal and regulatory
obligations.
How can I change my personal information?
You can change your personal information by logging into the Financial Engines Online Advice
service. If you have any questions, please email Financial Engines Investor Support at:
support@financialengines.com.
How will you notify me of changes in the use of my personally identifiable information?
If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that
stated at the time the information was collected, we will notify you via e-mail, and you will have
a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this way. In addition, if we make any
material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect information we have already
collected, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying you of the change. In some
cases we will also notify you by e-mail of certain changes in our privacy practices.
We will rely on the contact information that you, your plan sponsor or your plan administrator
provides to communicate any notices to you regarding data in your account.
