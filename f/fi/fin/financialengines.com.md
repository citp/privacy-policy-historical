# Financial Engines Privacy Policy

Financial Engines Privacy Policy
Effective October 15, 2015
We believe that the privacy and security of your data are essential. This statement summarizes
Financial Engines' policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of the personal
information you entrust to us.
What personal information is collected?
The types of personal information that we collect, or are collected on our behalf, depend on your
interactions with us, the service(s) available to you and/or the service(s) you have with us. This
information may include:
    •    Information that you provide, such as your name, age, salary, investment holdings and
         preferences, contact information and your credit card and billing information;
    •    Information about your use of our services, such as records of the advice that we provide
         to you and your communications to us about our services;
    •    Information about your transactions with third parties, such as changes to investment
         holdings and contribution rates; and
    •    Information from third parties (e.g., your retirement plan sponsor or administrator or
         other financial institution that makes our service available to you), such as your financial
         account information including financial institution, account balances and contributions,
         name, age, salary, contact information and investment holdings.
As described below, in limited circumstances, we may share any personal information that we
have about you with nonaffiliated third parties.
We collect data in our log files. This data may include your IP address, browser type, domain
name, the length of time of your visit, and the number of times you visit. We use this information
to gather information that helps us to provide you with services and information that are relevant
to you.
How is my information used?
Your personal, investment and forecast information are used by Financial Engines to provide you
with services, including information about new features or services from Financial Engines you
may be interested in, and to fulfill our legal and regulatory requirements. By having more
information about you, we are better able to customize our services to your particular situation.
Data that does not include personally identifiable information may be used for academic research
or other research purposes. For instance, we may compile data, excluding personally identifiable
information, for purposes of demographic analysis and research.

Also, if you choose to participate in voluntary surveys, webinars or user research which you may
receive from time to time, any information you provide will be handled in the manner specified.
How is my information protected?
We follow specific policies and procedures to maintain the confidentiality of your personal
information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your
information. We also restrict access to your personal information to those of our employees with
a business need to know such information.
With whom is my information shared?
Financial Engines will not sell, reveal or share any of your personally identifiable information to
others except in the following limited circumstances:
      • We have your permission to share the information;
      • We need to share your information with companies who work on our behalf to
         provide a product or service to you or to maintain or service your account (for example
         with a financial institution to execute transactions, or with a mailing service company to
         send communications to you; unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have
         any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what
         is necessary to assist us); or
      • We are required or authorized by law to disclose your information (for example, to
         comply with a subpoena or regulatory requirement, or to protect against fraud or illegal
         activity).
When you are no longer our customer, we may continue to share your personal information as
described in this section.
What are cookies and how are they used?

What choices are available to me regarding use of my information?

believe may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive future communications from us,
you may update your communications preferences in the Online Advice service. You can also

If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that
stated at the time the information was collected, we will notify you via e-mail, and you will have
a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this way. In addition, if we make any
material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect information we have already
