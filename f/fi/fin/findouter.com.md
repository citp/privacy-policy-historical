# Findouter's privacy policy

All searches on Findouter search engines are recorded. 

Information collected includes the browser used, IP address from which our site is accessed, search terms used etc. 

This information is used merely to track how effective we are in providing the information that users seek and to improve our search software. It is not traced back to individual users, and typically is not stored for more than a few weeks. 

We also serve advertisements by Google AdSense. Click on the following link to know more about [Google's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

Google's interest-based advertising allows advertisers to show ads based on a user's previous interactions with them, such as visits to advertiser website and also to reach users based on their interests (e.g. "sports enthusiast"). If you go to the previous link you can opt out of being tracked for the purpose of being shown such ads. 

We also use the statistics provided by Google's Analytics programme to know more about the countries from which our users come, the pages of most interest to them, etc.
