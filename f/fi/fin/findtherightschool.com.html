	<div id="left"><h1>Company Practices Regarding Your Privacy</h1><p>	We at QuinStreet and our affiliated companies worldwide are committed to respecting 	your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management 	of any information you share with us by using our web sites.</p><p>	QuinStreet has established the following Online Privacy Policy so that you can 	understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. This policy describes 	the overall privacy practices of QuinStreet regarding information we collect on our 	network of web sites and through our other Internet advertising mediums, including but 	not limited to email, newsletters, and leave-behinds. This policy does not apply to the 	practices of companies that QuinStreet does not own or control, or to people 	that QuinStreet does not employ. </p>	<h3>Information Collected by QuinStreet</h3>	<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</h3><p>	QuinStreet collects various types of information from you to better meet your needs and 	to provide you with a more relevant user experience. Some of this information is 	collected automatically through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer) or 	other Internet tracking technologies. The type of information your browser or Internet 	session may automatically provide us with can include the browser you are using, your 	Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP address and the URL 	you saw just before coming to the QuinStreet site, the pages of the site you visited and 	the URL of the page you visited upon leaving the site.</p><p>	QuinStreet may also contract with reputable third-party advertising companies to serve 	ads on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other measures to collect 	your non-personally identifiable information.</p>	<h3>Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</h3><p>	In addition, at some of the QuinStreet web sites, we collect information that you may 	choose to provide to us when requesting additional information from us or from one or 	more of our clients. Examples of personally identifiable data that you may provide to us 	include name, address, and email address. If you provide personally identifiable data to 	us, you may later elect to have your information deleted from our files, or kept from 	being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the opt-out 	procedures set forth below.</p>	<h3>How Collected Information is Used</h3><p>	The non-personally identifiable information that QuinStreet collects is used for marketing 	and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a 	more personally relevant experience. The information is also used to predict responses to 	advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most 	appropriate for different individuals.</p><p>	If you elect to provide QuinStreet with personally identifiable information, we may 	utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in follow-up 	communications from QuinStreet and from our clients. In addition, that information may 	be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to 	your preferences and behaviors, and for other QuinStreet sales and marketing efforts.</p>	<h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3><p>	All personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence by 	QuinStreet. There are instances, however, in which your personally identifiable and 	non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below.</p><p>	Your non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of QuinStreet on an anonymous basis.</p><p>	When you request information from QuinStreet or one or more of our clients, we may 	transfer that information within QuinStreet or route your information to our client(s), 	across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions 	around the world, so that they may provide the information on their product or service 	that you requested.</p><p>	We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar 	services as the original service about which you requested more information. In such 	situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be 	aware that QuinStreet is very careful in selecting companies with whom it does business.</p><p>	In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others, 	there is also the possibility that QuinStreet, or part(s) of the company, may one day be 	purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such transaction, the 	acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all collected personally identifiable 	information.</p><p>	Finally, QuinStreet may share your information as necessary to comply with a court order 	or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.</p>	<h3>Security</h3><p>	Wherever your personally identifiable information may be held within QuinStreet or on 	its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the information 	you shared with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Please note that while 	QuinStreet will make every reasonable effort to protect your information, no transmission 	of data over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>	<h3>Choice</h3>	<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information - Use of Cookies &amp; Opting-Out</h3><p>	Some of our web sites utilize cookies to collect information about your website activities 	and to recall the personal information you previously shared with us. Most browsers 	allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove 	them.</p><p>	You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to 	block cookies with your browser. Blocking cookies may result in a lower quality 	experience for you while you are visiting QuinStreet web sites.</p>	<h3>Personally Identifiable Consumer Information - Opting-Out</h3><p>	You may choose whether or not to provide personally identifiable information to 	QuinStreet. If you choose to provide such information to QuinStreet, you have the right 	to tell us not to make some of the uses of such information described herein or may have 	such information deleted in its entirety.

Our one-time email to your friend will inform him or her 	of this fact.</p>	<h3>Commitment</h3><p>	Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and QuinStreet's web sites are 	constantly changing to meet these demands.</p><p>	If you have any comments or questions regarding our Online Privacy Policy, please 	contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@QuinStreet.com">privacy@QuinStreet.com</a>.
