<div id="left"><h1>Company Practices Regarding Your Privacy</h1> <p>We at QuinStreet and our affiliated companies worldwide are committed to respecting  your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management  of any information you share with us by using our web sites.</p> <p>QuinStreet has established the following Online Privacy Policy so that you can  understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. This policy describes  the overall privacy practices of QuinStreet regarding information we collect on our  network of web sites and through our other Internet advertising mediums, including but  not limited to email, newsletters, and leave-behinds. This policy does not apply to the  practices of companies that QuinStreet does not own or control, or to people  that QuinStreet does not employ.</p> <h3>Information Collected by QuinStreet</h3> <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</h3> <p>QuinStreet collects various types of information from you to better meet your needs and  	to provide you with a more relevant user experience. Some of this information is  	collected automatically through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer) or  	other Internet tracking technologies. The type of information your browser or Internet  	session may automatically provide us with can include the browser you are using, your  	Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP address and the URL  	you saw just before coming to the QuinStreet site, the pages of the site you visited and  	the URL of the page you visited upon leaving the site.</p> <p>QuinStreet may also contract with reputable third-party advertising companies to serve  	ads on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other measures to collect  	your non-personally identifiable information.</p> 	<h3>Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</h3> <p>In addition, at some of the QuinStreet web sites, we collect information that you may  	choose to provide to us when requesting additional information from us or from one or  	more of our clients. Examples of personally identifiable data that you may provide to us  	include name, address, and email address. If you provide personally identifiable data to  	us, you may later elect to have your information deleted from our files, or kept from  	being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the opt-out  	procedures set forth below.</p> 	<h3>How Collected Information is Used</h3> <p>The non-personally identifiable information that QuinStreet collects is used for marketing  	and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a  	more personally relevant experience. The information is also used to predict responses to  	advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most  	appropriate for different individuals.</p> <p>If you elect to provide QuinStreet with personally identifiable information, we may  	utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in follow-up  	communications from QuinStreet and from our clients. In addition, that information may  	be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to  	your preferences and behaviors, and for other QuinStreet sales and marketing efforts.</p> 	<h3>Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3> <p>All personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence by  	QuinStreet. There are instances, however, in which your personally identifiable and  	non-personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, as described below.</p> <p>Your non-personally identifiable data may be shared with third-party partners of QuinStreet on an anonymous basis.</p> <p>When you request information from QuinStreet or one or more of our clients, we may  	transfer that information within QuinStreet or route your information to our client(s),  	across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions  	around the world, so that they may provide the information on their product or service  	that you requested.</p> <p>We may also disclose information to a third party who provides substantially similar  	services as the original service about which you requested more information. In such  	situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be  	aware that QuinStreet is very careful in selecting companies with whom it does business.</p> <p>In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others,  	there is also the possibility that QuinStreet, or part(s) of the company, may one day be  	purchased by, or merged with, another company. In the event of such transaction, the  	acquiring (or merging) company will have access to all collected personally identifiable  	information.</p> <p>Finally, QuinStreet may share your information as necessary to comply with a court order  	or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.</p> 	<h3>Security</h3> <p>Wherever your personally identifiable information may be held within QuinStreet or on  	its behalf, we intend to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the information  	you shared with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. Please note that while  	QuinStreet will make every reasonable effort to protect your information, no transmission  	of data over the Internet is 100% secure.</p> 	<h3>Choice</h3> 	<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information - Use of Cookies &amp; Opting-Out</h3> <p>Some of our web sites utilize cookies to collect information about your website activities  	and to recall the personal information you previously shared with us. Most browsers  	allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove  	them.</p> <p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to  	block cookies with your browser. Blocking cookies may result in a lower quality  	experience for you while you are visiting QuinStreet web sites.</p> 	<h3>Personally Identifiable Consumer Information - Opting-Out</h3> <p>You may choose whether or not to provide personally identifiable information to  	QuinStreet. If you choose to provide such information to QuinStreet, you have the right  	to tell us not to make some of the uses of such information described herein or may have  	such information deleted in its entirety. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters,  	surveys or promotional communications via email, you may opt-out by <a href="http://www.emchoice.com/unsubscribe/index.jsp?MERID=3589">clicking here</a> and  	following the instructions to unsubscribe.

Once we receive your instruction, we will promptly take corrective action.</p> 	<h3>Access/Accuracy</h3> <p>To the extent that you do provide us with personally identifiable information, QuinStreet  	wishes to maintain the accuracy of this information. Where we collect personally  	identifiable information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of  	contacting QuinStreet should you need to update or correct that information. If for any  	reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and  	corrections about your personally identifiable information to <a href="mailto:privacy@QuinStreet.com">privacy@QuinStreet.com</a> 	 and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in the information that we hold as soon as practicable.</p> 	<h3>Children's Privacy</h3> <p>In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),  	QuinStreet.com is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not intend to  	collect personally identifiable information from anyone we know to be under 13 years of  	age.</p> 	<h3>Refer a Friend</h3> <p>Some of QuinStreet's web sites offer you the opportunity to easily notify a friend of the  	offer or information promoted on the site. If you choose to use our referral service to tell  	a friend about a QuinStreet site, we will ask you for your friend's personally identifiable  	information, including name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a  	one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. QuinStreet stores this information for  	the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral  	program.</p> <p>Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@QuinStreet.com">privacy@QuinStreet.com</a> to request that we remove this  	information from our database. Our one-time email to your friend will inform him or her  	of this fact.</p> 	<h3>Commitment</h3> <p>Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and QuinStreet's web sites are  	constantly changing to meet these demands.</p> <p>If you have any comments or questions regarding our Online Privacy Policy, please  	contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@QuinStreet.com">privacy@QuinStreet.com</a>. While we cannot guarantee privacy perfection,  	we will address any issue to the best of our abilities as soon as practicable after you bring  	it to our attention.</p> 	<h3>Your Consent</h3> <p>By using this web site, you consent to the terms of our Online Privacy Policy and to  	QuinStreet's processing of personally identifiable information for the purposes given  	above. Should the Online Privacy Policy change, we intend to take every reasonable step  	to ensure that these changes are brought to your attention by posting all changes  	prominently on our web site for a reasonable period of time and by amending this privacy  	policy.</p> 	<h3>Contacting Us</h3> <p>For more information, or if you have questions or concerns regarding QuinStreet's  	Privacy Policy, you may email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@QuinStreet.com">privacy@QuinStreet.com</a> or you can send  	correspondence to the following address:</p> <pre>Privacy <br>	QuinStreet, Inc. <br>	950 Tower Lane, 6th Floor <br>	Foster City, CA 94404 <br>	(650) 578-7700</pre> <p>Thank you for visiting our web site.
