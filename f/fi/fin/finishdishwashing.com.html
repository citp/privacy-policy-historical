<p><b>1. What this Privacy Policy Covers</b><br>
</p><p>Reckitt Benckiser Inc. (USA) ("Reckitt Benckiser") respects the privacy of every individual who visits our sites or responds to our interactive advertisements. This Privacy Policy outlines the information Reckitt Benckiser will collect and how we will use that information.

<a name="2"></a>
<p><b>2. Personally Identifiable Information</b><br>
</p><p>Reckitt Benckiser will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily. For example, and not by limitation, we may collect personally identifiable information when you make a purchase, participate in a contest or sweepstakes promotion; fill out a questionnaire; sign up for a survey or otherwise interact with us.
</p><p>
When you provide personally identifiable information to us, we may ask if you want to receive future communication from us, such as newsletters, email or other information. You can choose not to receive this communication, if you wish and you may opt-out by clicking on the link on the bottom of an email you received or by <a href="javascript:openWin('optOut', 'optout.php',500,200);" style="color:#FFFFFF">clicking here</a>. 
If you do not want your personally identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please <a href="javascript:openWin('optOut', 'optout.php',500,200);" style="color:#FFFFFF">click here</a> to provide us with the email address. 
</p><p>

We may also combine the information you provide with information that we collect separately, including information you have provided to other organizations as well as public information. All of this will help us, for instance, better design our products, web sites and advertisements. In order to do this, we may also share your information with companies who carry out work for us. Information may be shared with service providers who provide services for or administer activities on behalf of Reckitt Benckiser (such as, but not limited to, authorization of credit card and check transactions, sweepstakes, promotions and contests.

Your personally identifiable information may also be shared with service providers who warehouse product, perform order fulfillment or provide hosting services.  These companies have agreed to only use your information in the way we tell them and to have procedures in place to protect the information. 
</p><p>
In the event a division or Reckitt Benckiser, or its assets, is bought or sold, personally identifiable information may be included among the transferred business assets.

Reckitt Benckiser may disclose specific personally identifiable information if it determines that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law or to protect the safety of the public. This includes exchanging personally identifiable information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
