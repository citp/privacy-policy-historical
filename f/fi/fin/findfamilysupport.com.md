Welcome to Find Family Support, a Web site ("Site").

We respect the privacy of those who access and/or use the Site ("you", "your", "user" or collectively "users") and are committed to protecting the personally identifiable information we collect.

If this Privacy Policy changes, we will post all changes in an amended version with a new "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. 

2\. **INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT**  
We collect two types of information from you. The first type is personal information that you actively choose to disclose ("Active Information") and the second type is anonymous aggregate information collected in a manner not visible to you or others visiting the Site ("Passive Information").

a. Active Information. Examples of personally identifiable information that you provide to us may include your first and last name, mailing address, email address, information about your finances, home ownership, education or interests. In providing Active Information, you consent and agree that we may us the information provided to present onsite advertising about third parties' products and services which are relevant to your stated interests. If you provide personally identifiable information to us, you may later elect to have that information kept from being used by us for marketing purposes. If you subscribe to our emails and newsletters, you may opt-out of receiving future mailings, by following the opt-out procedures set forth below. 

b. Passive Information. We record information relating to your use of the Site, such as the information you click on, your browser type, IP address, referring URL, and timestamp information. We use this type of information to administer the Site and provide the highest possible level of service to you. We may also use this information in the aggregate to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Site. 

3\. **HOW COLLECTED INFORMATION IS USED**  
We do not share or disclose your Active and/or Passive Information with third party companies for their marketing purposes except as stated in this Privacy Policy, as otherwise permitted by law, or as authorized by you. We may employ third-party service providers to deliver emails on our behalf. In the event we use third party service providers, they are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary data, consistent with the terms and obligations described in this privacy policy. The information we collect allows us to keep you informed about industry developments, opportunities involving services and products, and relevant news and information. It also allows us to provide you with information about relevant government program requirements specific to your location, and custom services based on your personal interests, requests and needs. Finally, we may use your information for internal company purposes such as auditing, data analysis, research, information verification and anti-fraud activities.

6\. **INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE**
