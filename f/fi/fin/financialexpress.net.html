                        This Privacy Statement relates solely to the online information collection and use

                        how we treat that information. This Privacy Statement, which may be updated from
                        time to time, has been developed to address those concerns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your use of this Web Site indicates to us that you have read and accept our privacy
                        practices, as outlined in this Privacy Statement. If you have any questions or concerns

                    <p>
                        When you visit our Web Site, you may provide us with two types of information: (1)
                        personally identifiable information that you knowingly choose to disclose, which
                        is collected on an individual basis, and (2) general user information that does
                        not contain personally identifiable information, which is collected on an aggregate
                        basis as you browse the Web Site. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us
                        with requested information, you may not be able to access all of our Web Site's
                        content or services.

                    <p>
                        We may ask for certain personal information from you for the purpose of providing
                        to you content and/or services that you request. For example, if you indicate an
                        interest in receiving literature about FE you are asked to submit your name, company
                        name, telephone and email address, which we retain on file, so that we may send
                        you the information that you requested. If you indicate on our Media Centre Subscription
                        Form that you are a member of the press, we may also send you information regarding
                        our business. We may retain a record of users who have contacted us in order to
                        respond properly to questions or concerns and for purposes of future communications.</p>

                        Cookies/ Web server logs: Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web Site utilises
                        standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect information
                        about how our Web Site is used. Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that
                        allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies
                        are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard
                        drive. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the
                        date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web Site, and the Web
                        sites visited just before and just after our Web Site. This information is collected
                        on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences
                        or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our
                        Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with
                        your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling
                        cookies.

                    <p>
                        We use your personally identifiable information to provide you with the information

                        programs, products, features or services. If you no longer wish to receive press
                        releases or any other type of information from us, you may send us an email to info@financialexpress.net.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We use non-identifying information collected on our Web Site in the aggregate to
                        better understand your use of the Web Site and to enhance your enjoyment and experience.
                        For example, we may use the information to improve the design and content of our
                        Web Site or to analyze the programs and services that we offer.
                    </p>

                        We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
                        Our employees, agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable
                        information are required to protect the information in a manner that is consistent
                        with this Privacy Statement.

                    <p>
                        We may provide access to your personally identifiable information when legally required
                        to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to
                        protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web Site, to limit our legal liability
                        and protect our rights, or to protect the rights and safety of visitors to this
                        Web Site or the public. In those instances, the information is provided only for
                        that limited purpose.

                    <p>
                        We will not share your personally identifiable information in ways unrelated to
                        those described above without providing you with an opportunity to opt out of such
                        use or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

                        If you visit our Web Site and volunteer personally identifiable information, you

                        or modify information in our databases. In addition, please be aware that your ability
                        to opt out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our
                        right to contact you regarding your use of our Web Site.</p>

                        <b>PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN USING THE INTERNET</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Protecting children's privacy is important to us. For that reason, we do not collect
                        or maintain information on our Web Site from those we actually know are under the
                        age of 13, nor is any part of our Web Site targeted to attract anyone under 13.
                        We request that all visitors to our Web Site who are under 13 not disclose or provide
                        any personally identifiable information. If we discover that a child under 13 has
                        provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete that child's
                        personally identifiable information from our records.</p>

                    <p>
                        We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable
                        information that we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical
                        access to our database servers, as well as installing electronic security systems
                        that guard against unauthorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet
                        can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant
                        the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own
                        risk.</p>
