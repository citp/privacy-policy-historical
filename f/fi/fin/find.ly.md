**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use a session ID cookie to temporarily save the data you may enter on one form, so that you do not need to enter it again on a similar form you may encounter during this same visit/session. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We use a persistent cookie so that the next time you come back to this a website that uses find.ly, you do not need to fill out the form again. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. 

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site fully, but the next time you come back to this site or any site using find.ly services, you will have to repeat the form completion process each time.

  * _Web beacons_



Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to make our site better to use, and to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns we use to help get people jobs.

We use a third party to gather information about how you and others use our Web site. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our site is used.  
  
**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [support@find.ly](mailto:support@find.ly)
