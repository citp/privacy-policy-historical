<p>Five Guys ("us" or "we") respects the privacy of visitors to our
Sites and registrants of our Services. This Privacy Policy is
intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the
collection, use and disclosure of any Personal Information you
submit to use through our Sites.</p>

<p>Five Guys provides certain websites, including the websites
available at the domain name http://www.fiveguys.com (each, a
"Site") and certain services made available to registered users of
the Sites ("Services"). By submitting any information through a
Site or registering for any Services, you acknowledge and agree
that Five Guys may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your Personal
Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data
according to this Privacy Policy. Personal Data may be processed by
Five Guys in the country where it was collected as well as other
countries (including the United States) where laws regarding
processing of Personal Data may be less stringent.</p>

<h2>THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

<p>Five Guys collects Personal Information and Anonymous
Information from you when you visit a Site, use the Services,
and/or send us information or communications. "Personal
Information" means information that allows someone to identify or
contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone
number, e-mail address, as well as any information about you that
is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information.
"Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated
with or linked to your Personal Information, including any feedback
you may provide; Anonymous Information does not permit the
identification of individual persons. We collect and use Personal
Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy
Policy.</p>

<h3>Personal Information You Provide to Us</h3>

<p>We may collect Personal Information that you submit to us
voluntarily through your access and/or use of a Site, including
your user name, password, billing name and address, contact
information such as phone numbers or e-mail addresses, and credit
card information.</p>

<h3>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</h3>

<p>As you access and/or use the Site and/or the Services, to make
the Sites more useful to you, we use technological means to collect
Personal Information from you, including the Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) you just came from, the URL you go to next, your
browser type, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We may also
use cookies to collect Personal Information from you about your use
of our Sites. You expressly consent to our use of cookies when you
use our Sites.</p>

<p>An "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to
your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP
address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but
if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address
probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses
solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page
flow.</p>

<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends
to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site.
Five Guys may use both session cookies (which expire once you close
your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your
computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal
and interactive experience on the Sites. Persistent cookies can be
removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you
choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Site and the Services
may not work properly.</p>

<h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p>In general, we use your Personal Information to respond to your
requests as submitted through the Services and to charge your
credit card the cost and transaction fee associated with the
Products you request. In addition, we may use your Personal
Information to determine your purchase preferences, to better
understand how the Sites and Services are used; to gauge traffic
patterns and determine what types of content and services are most
popular with users; and to contact you with information about Five
Guys' products, services, news and events. We will share your
Personal Information with third parties to fulfill your requests
for Products, and we may share your Personal Information with third
parties who perform services for us or on our behalf. You expressly
consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with these
third parties.</p>

<p>We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal
Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make
the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this
Anonymous Information to analyze request patterns and usage
patterns so that we may enhance our products and services. Five
Guys reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information
to third parties in its discretion.</p>

<p>We may also use your Personal Information to send information on
products, services, special offers, and promotions. Out of respect
for your privacy, we give you the option not to receive these types
of communications. If you would like to cease receiving any such
communications, you may unsubscribe by sending an email to <a href="mailto:websupport@fiveguys.com">websupport@fiveguys.com</a>.
You may not opt out of non-promotional communications from Five
Guys, including confirmation messages regarding successful order
requests.</p>

<p>We may share some or all of your Personal Information with
"affiliates" (parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or
other companies under common control), in which case we will
require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If our company
or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will
possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume
the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as
described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good
faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) to comply with relevant
laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Five Guys; or
(b) to protect and defend the rights or property of Five Guys or
users of our website.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>If you provide feedback on any of our products or services to
us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not
associate such feedback with your Personal Information. Five Guys
will collect any information contained in such communication and
will treat the Personal Information in such communication in
accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Regarding Children</h3>

<p>We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about
visitors who are under the age of 13. Furthermore, we do not
intentionally allow visitors under the age of 18 to register for
the services or submit photos.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for
your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other
website or location or its contents. We have no control over, do
not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites
or their content. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy
Policy do not apply to these outside websites.</p>

<h2>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p>We use reasonable measures to maintain the security of your
Personal Information. Five Guys makes use of Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) technology and keeps sensitive details stored in an encrypted
format in the Five Guys database.</p>

<p>Five Guys has implemented other industry-standard electronic
means of protecting your Personal Information. We store Personal
Information behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to
prevent outsiders from accessing our servers. In addition, Five
Guys protects your Personal Information from unauthorized physical
access by storing your Personal Information in a controlled
facility. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Five
Guys limits access to Personal Information in electronic databases
to those persons (including employees and contractors) in Five
Guys' organization who have a business need for such access.</p>

<p>Even though Five Guys has taken significant steps to ensure that
your Personal Information is not intercepted, accessed, used, or
disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that Five Guys
cannot eliminate security risks associated with Personal
Information.</p>

<h2>PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy is subject to revision, and if we make any
substantial changes in the way we collect, use, or disclose your
Personal Information, we will post a notice on this page. If you
object to any such changes, you must cease using the Sites.
Continued use of our Sites following notice of any such changes
shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement
to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</p>

<h2>CONTACT US</h2>

<p>You may contact the Privacy Officer to access, correct or delete
your Personal Information. If necessary, the Privacy Officer will
contact another employee to assist in completing your requested
task.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or complaints, please contact the
Privacy Officer. The Privacy Officer can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:websupport@fiveguys.com">websupport@fiveguys.com</a>;
