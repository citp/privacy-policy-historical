        <h3 class="title8 mb25">Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
            Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy addresses how Five Four Group, LLC, (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries, NRS, LLC, and Grand AC, LLC (collectively, “Five Four”) collect and use information you provide. By visiting <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.fivefourclub.com">www.FiveFourClub.com</a> (this “Site”) and/or providing your information to us, you acknowledge and agree to accept the practices and terms of this Privacy Policy and also agree to the Terms of Service, Use, and Purchase (the “Terms”).
            <br><br>

            Please further note, depending on your particular interaction with Five Four, different portions of this Privacy Policy may apply to your use at different times (e.g. users who solely navigate the Site versus users who create an account and purchase the goods offered on the Site).
        </p>

        <h4 class="title9">What information do we collect?</h4>

        <p>We collect information from you when you register on our site, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey or fill out a form. We group the collection of user information into two categories: Personal and Non-Personal.

        </ul>

        <h4 class="title9">How do we use your information?</h4>

        <p>

        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h4 class="title9">How is this Information Shared?</h4>

        <p>
            There are certain circumstances in which we may share your Customer Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We may share information about you with trusted third parties to perform functions on our behalf in order to improve your user experience. These third parties may contact you about products, services or promotions you may be interested in, or to otherwise improve your user experience with the Site. For example, outsourced customer care agents or technology assistants may need access to your information to perform services you requested. Your information will be treated as private and confidential by such service providers and not used for any other purpose than we authorize.</li>
            <li>In developing and growing our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of corporate sale, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization or sale of assets, Five Four reserves the right to sell or transfer all User Information (including Personal Information) as part of any such transaction. To the maximum extent allowable by law, the Privacy Policy will apply to the User Information as transferred to the successor entity. However, User Information submitted after a transfer to a successor entity may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">When it is necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of Five Four, its users, customers, or the public.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: circle;">As required by law, to comply with a judicial proceeding or court order, to exercise our rights, or to defend against any claims. You acknowledge and agree that we may disclose information you provide if required to do so by law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1) comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); (2) protect or defend Five Four, or a third party’s, rights or property; or (3) protect someone’s health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is threatened.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h4 class="title9">How do we protect your information?</h4>
        <p>
            We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your Personal Information. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Stripe payment processing and is accessible only to those authorized with special access rights to such technology and are required to keep the information confidential.
            <br><br>
            Five Four stays up-to-date with the latest in security technologies to ensure that your credit card information, contact information and shipping/billing information are confidential and safe.  We are PCI compliant and follow generally accepted industry standards on information security management to safeguard the personal information submitted to us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Data that is transported over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be accessible to anybody. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such open networks. When disclosing any Personal Information via an open network, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. Your data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorized parties. We do not accept any liability for direct or indirect losses as regards the security of your Personal Information or data during its transfer via Internet. Please use other means of communication if you think this is necessary or prudent for security reasons.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title9">Do we use cookies?</h4>

        <p>Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart.
            <br><br>
            Notice for California Users – California law entitles residents to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties for those entities direct marketing purposes. If you want to request a notice or have any questions about Five Four privacy practices, please contact us at: service@fivefourclub.com.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title9">Web Beacon</h4>
        <p>
            Web beacons, or clear gifs, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use web beacons, tracking technology, and other automated tracking methods to help us better manage content on our Site and measure performance and engagement. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to your personal information.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title9">Opting Out</h4>
        <p>
            Five Four may occasionally send you emails regarding special offers, promotions, features and/or product updates. Five Four may also communicate with you on behalf of third parties about special offers, promotions, features and/or product updates we think may be of interest to you, or you may have opted-in to receive newsletters or special promotions from one of our trusted third party providers. If you decide you do not wish to receive these communications, you may opt-out by clicking the unsubscribe link or by following the instructions included in the communication. We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement your opt-out requests promptly, but you may still receive communications from us for up to ten business days as we process your request.  However, you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary for use of the Site, such as billing or shipping confirmations

We may also retain archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title9">Children’s Privacy</h4>
