  *  **Information You Provide**



We collect information from you when you voluntarily provide it, such as when you register for access to the Services and create an account, use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. For example, we may collect your name, phone number, email address, photograph, birthdate, location information, Third-Party Service (defined below) login credentials, other information (such as your name and online activity) based on your registration and privacy settings on those Third-Party Services, and the messages you send or receive through the Services.

If you provide information, you acknowledge and agree that such information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Fivestars and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.  **

When you interact with the Services, we also may use various technologies, including cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, log files, local shared objects (Flash cookies), HTML5 cookies, or other tracking technologies, to automatically collect certain general user data and information, including aggregate measures of the Services’ use and aggregate technical and other data about your use of the Services that does not personally identify you.

In addition, one of the special features of the Services is that they allow you to integrate various online third-party services, such as social media and social networking services (“ ** _Third-Party Services_** ”), directly into your Fivestars experience.

  2.  **INFORMATION USE**



Fivestars uses the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information for a certain reason, we may use that information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide information to obtain access to the Fivestars Services, we will use your information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.

Fivestars and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “ ** _Related Companies_** ”) may also use the information collected from and about you through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users, and to improve the Fivestars Services. Fivestars and its Related Companies may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. Fivestars may also use your information in other ways, with your consent or as disclosed to you at the time of collection.

  3.  **INFORMATION DISCLOSURE**



Fivestars is not in the business of selling your personal information. We consider personal information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

  *  **Rewards Providers** : To the extent you have obtained or redeemed a reward offered by a Rewards Provider, added a Rewards Provider as a membership to your account, made a purchase at or through a Rewards Provider, or otherwise participated in any other activity sponsored or offered on behalf of the Rewards Provider, we may provide your information to such Rewards Providers (a) for the Rewards Provider to redeem and validate your reward, send you customized offers, troubleshoot redemption, combat fraud and otherwise communicate with you; (b) as part of legal proceedings affecting Fivestars or the Rewards Provider; or (c) to send you marketing information or otherwise facilitate a direct relationship between the Rewards Provider and you.
  *  **Business Transfers** : As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, your information may be part of the transferred assets. We will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use information provided through the Services in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy
  *  **Related Companies** : We may also share your information with our Related Companies, but will only do so in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
  *  **Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties** : Fivestars, like many businesses, sometimes hires agents or service providers to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include maintaining databases, sending emails and SMS messages, offering and developing certain features of the Services, and performing maintenance and security. When we employ an agent or service provider to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. We also disclose automatically collected data (card scans, promotional activities, and redemption information) to our Rewards Providers, third-party ad servers, and third-party advertisers. These third parties may match this data with information that they have previously collected about you under their own privacy policies.
  *  **Your Public Profile** : If you make any information available through your public profile, it will be made available to members of the Fivestars community. Please note that your first name and last initial and photo are, by default, available on your public profile, while your phone number, email, and birthday are kept nonpublic (consistent with this Privacy Policy). Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas of the Services.
  *  **Legal Requirements** : Fivestars may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation or assist government enforcement agencies, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Fivestars, Rewards Providers, or our users, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) protect Rewards Providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; or (vi) protect the security or integrity of the Services.


  4.  **YOUR CHOICES AND OPT-OUTS**



We do not share your personal information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your consent except as part of a specific program or feature for which we will provide the ability to opt out. The Services will automatically send you SMS messages with updates and other information. You may stop receiving SMS messages by replying STOP or OFF in response to any received SMS message. You may also opt-out of receiving SMS messages on the Fivestars website. If you opt-out of receiving SMS messages, you may not be able to use certain Services.

The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Fivestars (the “ ** _Third-Party Sites_** ”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third-Party Sites. The links do not imply that Fivestars endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.


  7.  **SECURITY**



Fivestars takes reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email, mobile or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you provide.

The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, it may be necessary for Fivestars to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Fivestars reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice.
