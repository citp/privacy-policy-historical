# Privacy Policy| Five Guys Burgers and Fries

Five Guys ("us" or "we") respects the privacy of visitors to our Sites and registrants of our Services. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any Personal Information you submit to use through our Sites.

Five Guys provides certain websites, including the websites available at the domain name http://www.fiveguys.com (each, a "Site") and certain services made available to registered users of the Sites ("Services"). By submitting any information through a Site or registering for any Services, you acknowledge and agree that Five Guys may process (i.e., collect, use, etc.) your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

You expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data according to this Privacy Policy. Personal Data may be processed by Five Guys in the country where it was collected as well as other countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent.

## THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Five Guys collects Personal Information and Anonymous Information from you when you visit a Site, use the Services, and/or send us information or communications. "Personal Information" means information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. "Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information, including any feedback you may provide; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

### Personal Information You Provide to Us

We may collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through your access and/or use of a Site, including your user name, password, billing name and address, contact information such as phone numbers or e-mail addresses, and credit card information.

### Personal Information Collected Via Technology

As you access and/or use the Site and/or the Services, to make the Sites more useful to you, we use technological means to collect Personal Information from you, including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you just came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We may also use cookies to collect Personal Information from you about your use of our Sites. You expressly consent to our use of cookies when you use our Sites.

An "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. Five Guys may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Site and the Services may not work properly.

## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

In general, we use your Personal Information to respond to your requests as submitted through the Services and to charge your credit card the cost and transaction fee associated with the Products you request. In addition, we may use your Personal Information to determine your purchase preferences, to better understand how the Sites and Services are used; to gauge traffic patterns and determine what types of content and services are most popular with users; and to contact you with information about Five Guys' products, services, news and events. We will share your Personal Information with third parties to fulfill your requests for Products, and we may share your Personal Information with third parties who perform services for us or on our behalf. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with these third parties.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this Anonymous Information to analyze request patterns and usage patterns so that we may enhance our products and services. Five Guys reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to third parties in its discretion.

We may also use your Personal Information to send information on products, services, special offers, and promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we give you the option not to receive these types of communications. If you would like to cease receiving any such communications, you may unsubscribe by sending an email to [websupport@fiveguys.com](mailto:websupport@fiveguys.com). You may not opt out of non-promotional communications from Five Guys, including confirmation messages regarding successful order requests.

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with "affiliates" (parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control), in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Five Guys; or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of Five Guys or users of our website.

### Feedback

If you provide feedback on any of our products or services to us, we may use such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. Five Guys will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat the Personal Information in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Regarding Children

We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under the age of 13. Furthermore, we do not intentionally allow visitors under the age of 18 to register for the services or submit photos.

### Links to Other Sites

Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites.

## HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

We use reasonable measures to maintain the security of your Personal Information. Five Guys makes use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and keeps sensitive details stored in an encrypted format in the Five Guys database.

Five Guys has implemented other industry-standard electronic means of protecting your Personal Information. We store Personal Information behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to prevent outsiders from accessing our servers. In addition, Five Guys protects your Personal Information from unauthorized physical access by storing your Personal Information in a controlled facility. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, Five Guys limits access to Personal Information in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in Five Guys' organization who have a business need for such access.

Even though Five Guys has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Information is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that Five Guys cannot eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information.
