<p>We at FigShare LLP. (“FigShare” “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”) know that our users
(“you,” “your”) care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take
your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By
visiting the Site or using the Service in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the
practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and you hereby consent that we will collect,
use, and share your information in the following ways. Any capitalized terms used herein
without definition shall have the meaning given to them in the Company’s Terms of Use http://
figshare.com/terms</p>

<p>1. What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of
personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are
accessing or using our Service, including without limitation access to the Service by or through
the figshare.com website, any third party integration of the Service, and any software owned,
operated or licensed by us. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do
not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or
knowingly allow such persons to register for the Service (as that term is defined in our Terms
of Use http://figshare.com/terms. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the
Service or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone
number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us
or on the Service. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from
a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information
as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child
under 13, please contact us at support@figshare.com</p>

<p>2. What Information Do We Collect? We gather various types of Personal Information from our
users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to personalize and
improve our services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to
fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Site, and
as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information
with third parties (described in this Section and in Section 3 below). We collect the following
types of information:</p>

<p>A. Information You Provide to Us. We receive and store any information you knowingly provide
to us. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, job
title and institutional or organizational affiliation. If we provide Services for which payment
is required and you elect to receive such services, we may also receive and store Personal
Information necessary to collect payment from you, including your credit card number and billing
information. We also receive and store information you provide us that is contained in User
Submissions, including without limitation articles you Submit to the Service. You can choose not
to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take
advantage of some or all of the Service features. In addition, we may anonymize your Personal
Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our
partners, investors, Content providers or other third parties.</p>

<p>B. Information Collected Automatically. Whenever you interact with our Site, we automatically
receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address,
browser information, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers
we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile
device and tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many people. You
may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your
computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage
of some or all of the Service features. If you access the Service through a third party website,
that third party website may also transmit cookies to your computer or device. In addition, our
advertising partners, if any, or those of a third party website, may also transmit cookies to your
computer or device. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.
When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Site),
we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.
For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Site, so that we can
make the Site or Service appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this
aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand
how often and in what ways people use our Service, so that they, too, can provide you with
an optimal experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that
would identify you personally.</p>

<p>C. E-mail and Other Communications. We may contact you, by email or other means; for
example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate
with you about your use of the Service. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open
an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve
our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your
preference by clicking the unsubscribe option at the base of any emails that you receive from
us. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will
still govern your use of the Service, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for
changes.</p>

<p>3. Will We Share Any of the Personal Information we Receive? We neither rent nor sell
your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We share your Personal
Information in personally identifiable form with third parties as described below.</p>

<p>A. Advertisers. We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the
demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers
and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-
personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate
audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are
located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will
not tell such businesses who you are.</p>

<p>B. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control. In certain situations,
businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to
you through the Service (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated
business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal
Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or
service. In addition, we may send your information to third parties when you elect to use certain
features of the Service. While we neither solicit nor knowingly collect Personal Information in
this context, we have no control over the content you Submit nor over the policies and practices
of third parties as to privacy or anything else related to the content you Submit.</p>

<p>C. Agents. We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need
to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you
differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them
beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>

<p>D. Other Persons Whom You Elect to Receive Your Personal Information. You may request that
certain information, including your name, email address, and any of your User Submissions, be
displayed or provided to other persons by or through the Service (e.g., if you make your research
publicly available). We have no control over the policies and practices of third parties as to
privacy or anything else related to the information you request us to display or provide to other
persons.</p>

<p>E. Business Transfers. We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions,
customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or
substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or
go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets
transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>

<p>F. Protection of Company and Others. We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and
disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court
order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights,
property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging
information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
reduction.</p>

<p>G. With Your Consent. Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal
Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this
information.</p>

<p>4. Is Personal Information About Me Secure? Your account is protected by a password for your
privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal
Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your
computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in
our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware
or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any
time.</p>

<p>The Site may contain links to other sites, or you may be allowed to access the Service from
other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When
following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.</p>

<p>5. What personal information can I access? By accessing the Account and Profile-Settings,
you may access and edit the following information you’ve provided to us:</p>
name<br>
email address<br>
employer or institutional affiliation<br>
credit card information, if provided<br>
user names and passwords<br>
biographical information<br><br>
The information you can view and edit may change as the Site or Service changes. If you have
any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact
us at support@figshare com.<p></p>

<p>6. What Choices Do I Have? You can always opt not to disclose information we use, but keep in
mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some or all of
the Service’s features.</p>

<p>You can access and edit certain information as explained in Section 5 above. When you update
information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You
may request deletion of your account by writing to support@figshare.com. Please note that
some information may remain in our private records after your deletion of such information from
your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal
Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>

<p>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy. We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of
information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information
is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by
posting a notice on the Site, on or through the Service, or by sending an email to the email
address associated with your account. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy
when you use the Service after such changes have been first posted.</p>

<p>8. Questions, CONCERNS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION. If you have any questions
or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to
support@figshare.com. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns. Any disputes
arising from this Privacy Policy, or from the use or processing of any Personal Information
we obtain from you in connection with the Service, shall be handled in accordance with the
Dispute Resolution terms set forth in Section 14 of Company’s Terms of Use, available at
http://figshare.com/terms</p>
