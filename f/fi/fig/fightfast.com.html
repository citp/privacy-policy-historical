        <p><span class="leftnav">"Paul has one advantage nobody else has-actual

          the video. Don't just watch and expect it to work. Practice untill you 
          learn it then minimal maintenance is required. Could save your life! 
          Only wish I could find a willing partner as in the video to practice 
          with..."</span></p>
        <p><span class="lft"><b>You really could take down someone twice your size</b><br>
          "If you are after very basic self defence and thats all, you can't go 
          far wrong with this video. This video does not contain armed forces 
          unarmed combat as such. A few of the moves look similar to others I 
          have studied. I feel that this video is a bit too concerned with what 
          to do then run away. I know taking your self out of harms way is what 
          should be done, but there is nothing on blocking attacks or punching. 
          I would recomend this video to women (thats not being sexist by the 
          way, you will understand the practical aplications if you see the video) 
          and people with fears about walking dark streets etc. For people that 
          want a bit more of a traditional fighting without running away you should 
          check out some of Pauls other stuff. It is really amazing.<br>
          I think I would be wrong to dismiss this info, when it is instinctive 
          it is a brilliant form of defence. <br>
          If you need extra confidence on the street you will like this video.<br>
          This is in addition to what I wrote previously. I dont think I gave 
          this video time to sink in before reviewing it. Now after practicing 
          the moves for a while I had a chance to put them into practice. Even 
          after a few drinks the moves were imprinted on my brain and instanteneous... 
          "</span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft"><b>THIS FIGHTING SYSTEM IS TRULY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b></span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft">"If you want to Defend Yourself, Buy 
          This tape NOW. You will love it. The moves are incredible and extremely 
          simple. Now I know why the navy seals are the world's greatest fighters!!!! 
          EVERYONE MUST HAVE IT!!!!!"</span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft">"Our guys love it because they don't 
          have to spend thousands of hours on the mat training. The principals 
          are simplistic and realistic. "</span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft">"I would absolutely without hesistation 
          recommend Paul and his system to anyone!"</span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft">"This is a fighting system! Paul Vunak's 
          system is functional fighting; it is clean, simkple and will make you 
          a better fighting very, very fast!"</span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft">"On behalf of the Healeah Police Department, 
          I would like to commend Paul for his contribution of outstanding self 
          defense training. A job well done!"</span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft">"Finally the SEALS no longer will be 
          doing reverse punches and flying side kicks while carrying ruc sacks 
          and machine guns. Thanks Paul!"</span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft"><b>Good simplification of Lee's JKD</b></span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft">"Mr. Vunak is a highly respected hand-to-hand 
          combat instructor and martial arts "guro".Vunak was once the leading 
          student of the great Dan Inosanto,Bruce Lee's protege.After going off 
          on his own,Vunak became a student of Brazilian Jujitsu under Rorion 
          Gracie.I believe that Vunak was the first Jeet Kune Do Concepts instructor 
          to recognize the value of Brazilian grappling.This was long before Royce 
          Gracie shocked the martial arts world by easily winning the first ULTIMATE 
          FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP in 1993.<br>
          The video is unique in its teaching format and the techniques are servicable. 
          One minor criticism of the tape is the emphasis on the Filipino "gunting" 
          (limb destruction) entry.The gunting makes sense with a blade ot a stick.It 
          is hard to work with bare hands,unless someone insists on running and 
          arm or leg into your knee or elbow.I think a destruction is okay to 
          take if it comes,but it is not something one should look for.<br>
          The section on the use of knees,elbows,and headbutts is brutal,and definitely 
          not for the kiddies. Overall,I rate Mr. Vunak very highly as a credible 
          source of knowledge in the area of realistic self-defense"</span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft"><b>Awesome!</b><br>
          "I'm so impressed by this video that I'll attempt to make arrangements 
          for personal training from Paul Vunak. "</span></p>
        <p class="leftnav"><span class="lft"><b>The shortcut to effective fighting 
          ability</b><br>
          "You need to be able to defend yourself in a hurry? You need it for 
          real life? You have no training partner and very little time?<br>
          BUY THIS VIDEO!! These are hard hitting, effective fighting moves designed 
          to overcome your attacker in the blink of an eye. No there are not thousand 
          techniques to counter any move an attacker might make, that's impossible 
          but it contains a small series of moves (the R.A.T System) designed 
          to fit most. And as a bonus you get interactive training sessions with 
          Paul Vunak. The crux of it? You need a vicious, aggressive attitude 
          to make the system work."</span></p></td>
