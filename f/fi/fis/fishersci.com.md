## Session tracking and "cookies"

The product selection and ordering process requires that each Web page recognize your entire visit to the site - a technology known as a "session tracking." One way to accomplish session tracking is to save "cookies" to your computer. **fishersci.com** may use cookies, or functionally equivalent technology, to accomplish session tracking.

Session tracking through the use of cookies allows you to place products in your Shopping Cart while browsing for other products and enables you to avoid re-entering data on multiple pages.

Thermo Fisher Scientific does not use cookies or the information obtained through cookies for any purpose unrelated to your activities on **fishersci.com**.

Please note: The "session ID" (as described below) is assigned to each session. If you visit **fishersci.com** and leave for any reason, your ID will have changed when you return. If you were a logged-in Registered User for the previous session, any items you placed in your Shopping Cart will be saved for you. If were not logged in, those items will be lost.
