We do not ask you for your real name or address to participate on fiso.co.uk.

Any information beyond your user name, your password, and your e-mail address during the registration process is optional. You can enter profile information about your forum username via your user control panel. This information (including your email address) can be changed by you at any time.

Should you forget your password for your account, you can use the �I forgot my password� feature provided by the phpBB software. This process will ask you to submit your user name and your e-mail, then the phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim your account.

Should you register for FISO's Forums (you need to be over 16 to do so) then there are certain terms that you will need to agree to before you can register. An excerpt from the terms are as follows (please especially note the sentences **in bold** ):
