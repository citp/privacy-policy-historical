Optional information such as your age or gender may also be requested. 

Additionally, our web server automatically collects click-stream information such as the address (or "URL") of the website that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you have entered on our site.

Whenever you request a page from The Websites your IP address, browser and version, operating system, and the site from which you came are stored in a log file. This information cannot be used to identify a specific individual. This information is used for statistical purposes in order to improve The Websites and provide accurate statistics to track usage on The Websites.

We use the information you provide in order to 1) fulfill requests for products, services or information, 2) administer your membership accounts, 3) provide member services, 4) administer contests or promotions, 5) offer new products and services, 6) measure and improve the effectiveness of our websites or our marketing endeavors, 7) tailor our online offerings to your preferences, and 8) other business purposes. NAMG will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of having your information used for marketing communications.

In addition, we may share your information with our affiliates and with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your information shared, write to us at [optout@namginc.com](mailto:optout@namginc.com).

Except as provided herein so long as you activate your membership, NAMG will not sell to any third party your email address unless you provide your informed consent, except to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws, police investigations, or in legal proceedings where such information is relevant. 

NAMG allows access to database information by third parties providing technical services, such as e-mail, but only to the extent necessary to provide you with those services. In those instances, the third party is bound by these terms. Your informed consent shall be in the form of an "opt in" or similar policy. You understand and agree that we may disclose to third parties your zip code, gender and/or age, but only in the form of aggregated information. In addition, you agree that we may assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party, your name, address, email address, member name and any other personal information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock of NAMG or its affiliated entities.

If you choose not to activate your membership, your name and email address may be shared with third parties.

We reserve the right to offer you third party services and products based on the preferences that you identify during the registration process or from information gathered from surveys and based on your subsequent preferences; such offers may be provided to you by NAMG.

We reserve the right to terminate your account if we learn that you have provided NAMG with false or misleading registration information.

We may also disclose users' personal information if we believe that we are required to do so (i) by law, (ii) 

to comply with legal process or governmental requests, (iii) to enforce our [Terms of Service](http://namginc.com/terms_of_service.html), or (iv) to protect the rights, property, or safety of NAMG, its users or the public.

**THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS**  
We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to website hosting, order processing and fulfillment, credit card clearance, e-commerce affiliation, data analysis, emailing and other services of an administrative nature. Personal information, including financial information, is shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. 

**COOKIES**  
"Cookies" are small text files a website can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of the site and allow tracking of usage behavior. Cookies are used to compile aggregate data that allows content improvements and targeted advertising. We share aggregated data (information that does not identify you) with third parties. Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. If you do not want non-personal information about your visits collected through the use of cookies, you may set your computer to deny or accept the cookie feature through a simple process in most browsers; however, without cookies we may be unable to provide you with certain features (e.g., customized or personalized delivery of information) otherwise available on The Websites. 

**CHILDREN**  
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Websites are not directed at children under the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not provide any personal information on The Websites. We will not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information online from children under the age of 18.

**SECURITY**  
NAMG maintains practices and procedures designed to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of personal information collection through the Sites. A firewall protects the e-mail server to which all personal information is delivered. Access to the information is limited to those employees and contractors who need it to carry out their business functions. NAMG's employees are educated about the importance of safeguarding personal information and preventing unauthorized access, disclosure and use. Finally, we use secure server software ("SSL") that encrypts credit card information (including your name and address) submitted to any of The Websites. This encryption protects this information so it cannot be viewed as it is transmitted over the Internet. ****
