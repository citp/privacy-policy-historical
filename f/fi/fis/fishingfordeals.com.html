<title>Privacy Policy</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">



<p align="center"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><b>PRIVACY 
  POLICY</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">This privacy statement is 
  applicable to all sites operated by Fishing For Deals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Fishing For Deals does not 
  collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when individuals 
  specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. This personally 
  identifiable information may be typically gathered from a contest or sweepstakes 
  registration, community postings (e.g., forums and bulletin boards), suggestions, 
  voting/polling activities and transactional areas. <i><u>Personally identifiable 
  information on individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to 
  unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection. 
  When we collect such information, the user will have the opportunity to indicate 
  whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving promotional 
  and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings from 
  Fishing For Deals and/or any third parties. Further, notwithstanding any "opt 
  out" of promotional information by the user, Fishing For Deals reserves 
  the right to contact individuals regarding matters relevant to the underlying 
  service and/or the information collected.</u></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Fishing For Deals reserves 
  the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics 
  in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and 
  to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that 
  have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners, if present. Fishing 
  For Deals will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. 
  Also, users should be aware Fishing For Deals may occasionally permit third 
  parties to offer services through a Fishing For Deals site. Fishing For Deals 
  is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and users 
  should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally 
  identifiable information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Additionally, users should 
  be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information 
  on the bulletin boards or forums of Fishing For Deals, such information, along 
  with any substantive information disclosed in the user's communication, can 
  be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited 
  messages from other posters or third parties. <b>Such activities are not condoned 
  or endorsed by Fishing For Deals, but remain beyond our control.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Users also should be aware 
  that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through 
  the standard operation of Fishing For Deals's Internet servers or through the 
  use of "cookies." Users should be aware that Fishing For Deals cannot 
  control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third 
  parties hosting data for Fishing For Deals. Most web browsers have a feature 
  that will allow the user to accept or deny a cookie. The user should be aware, 
  however, that the use of such cookies may be necessary to provide the user with 
  certain features available on Fishing For Deals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Upon request, Fishing For 
  Deals will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional contacts 
  at any time. Additionally upon request, Fishing For Deals will use reasonable 
  efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously submitted 
  which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will not compromise 
  privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request, Fishing For Deals 
  will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and 
  his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible 
  to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups 
  and records of deletions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">We do not disclose the identities 
  of ours users unless we are legally required to do so. If a governmental agency 
  (for example, law enforcement agencies, US Attorneys' offices or similar governmental 
  agencies) sends us a subpoena, we will comply with it. If we receive a subpoena 
  by a third party that is not a governmental agency (for example, a subpoena 
  in connection with civil litigation), we will contact the user whose identity 
  has been requested using the contact information the user provided during the 
  registration process. We will wait 10 days after notifying the user before complying 
  with the subpoena, unless the subpoena requires us to disclose this information 
  before then. If we cannot wait 10 days because of the deadline in the subpoena, 
  we will let the user know the deadline included in the subpoena when we provide 
  notice that we received it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">The foregoing policies are 
  effective as of March 4, 2001. Fishing For Deals reserves the right to change 
  this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence of a new privacy 
  statement. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended 
  to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of 
  any party.</font></p>
