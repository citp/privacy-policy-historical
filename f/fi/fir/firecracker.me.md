## Overview

Thank you for using Firecracker! This Privacy Policy provides Firecracker’s (“we” or “our”) policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can access our website and services (the “Services”) through our website www.firecracker.me, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “Device” is any computer used to access our Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the our Services, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.” 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us by e-mail at [chat@firecracker.me.](mailto:chat@firecracker.me)

## Information We Collect & How We Use It

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows us to provide Services that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Services to make your experience safer and easier. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. 

In general, you can browse our Services without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. 

## Information You Choose to Share

In order to use some of our Services, you must first complete the registration form and create a username and password. During registration, you are required to give truthful contact information (such as a valid email address) in accordance with our Terms of Service. We use this information to contact you about Services in which you have expressed interest. 

Your information also includes the information you choose to share on our website, such as when you post a message, add notes in a module, upload a photo, or comment on another user's post. Your information also includes the information you choose to share when you take an action, such as when you add a friend to your group. We may also receive information about you from the modules, exercises, and other services you use that we provide on the Websites. 

### Information We Collect To Respond To Your Choices and Requests

_Orders_

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as your email address) and financial information (such as a credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. 

_Surveys or Contests_

We may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our website. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information. 

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor traffic on our website, or to personalize our services (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys). 

_Tell-A-Friend_

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Website. Firecracker Inc. will store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [chat@firecracker.me](mailto:chat@firecracker.me) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

_Posting in Public Message Areas_

If you choose to post messages in our public message areas (whether restricted to a select group or to the general public) or leave feedback for other users, we will collect the information you post. We may receive information about you from other users, who post content about you in a forum. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law. We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of visitors who use these services in a manner inconsistent with our Terms of Service. 

When we use the phrase "public information", we mean the information you choose to disclose to other uses of our Services, as well as information that is always publicly available. By posting information in a public message area, you are choosing to make your information public. 

Choosing to make your information public also means that this information: 

  1. Can be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile picture, Firecracker profile, username, etc.)
  2. Can show up when someone does a search on Firecracker
  3. When others share information about you, they can also choose to make it public.



The types of information listed below are by default publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public. 

  1. Name: When you post information in a public message area your Nickname will be associated with the message. Other users may find your Nickname by searching for it through the Services. 
  2. Profile Pictures: This helps other users recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making your profile picture public, you can always delete it by hovering over your photo and clicking "Change Picture." A default profile picture will be assigned to your profile until you select one. 
  3. Custom Created Groups: Firecracker allows you to create custom groups of other users to share information. Custom groups may include study groups, friends, classmates, communities, or other groups (“Custom Group”). This helps you see whom you will be sharing information with before you choose a Custom Group as a custom audience to a post. 



## Information We Collect About Anonymous Visitors

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. 

_Log Files_

Like many Websites, we automatically gather certain information about our Website traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our user base. We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifiable information. We may use a third-party tracking service that uses log files and cookies, see below, to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Website in the aggregate. This service captures usage and volume statistics to improve the usage of our Website and to track responses to marketing efforts. 

_Cookies_

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies on this Website. As noted above, we do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our Website. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by the Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

We use session ID cookies on certain portions of our Website. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We may use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Website. In addition, our third party analytics provider, if any, may use cookies to track movement on non-secure portions of the Website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Website, but your ability to use some areas of our Website, such as contests or surveys, may be limited. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Website. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Advertisers.” 

_Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)_

We may employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or web bugs that help manage content on the Website by tracking what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.” Communication from Us or the Website

_Service-Related Announcements_

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.

If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 

_Customer Service_

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. 

_Profile_

We may store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a “profile” of your preferences. We do not tie your personally identifiable information, or your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the Website for you. We do not share your profile with other third parties. 

_Conditions Under Which We Share Information Aggregate Information (Non-Personally Identifiable)_

We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners. This information does not identify individual users. We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.

We may use and publicize such aggregate information on any basis that does not identify you, without your consent.

_Choice/Opt-out_
