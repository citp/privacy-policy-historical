**Order and Credit Card Information**

Firetrust uses "element5", a third-party provider of e-commerce solutions, to power the Firetrust.com store and in doing so, collects information about users, including credit card information. When a user purchases a product from the Firetrust.com store, element5 provides information about the customer, including name, address and email address, to Firetrust. Firetrust uses this information as set out in the end user agreement, agreed to by purchasers at the time of purchase. In particular, Firetrust uses the information to license the software to you, support the software and send you information about updates, upgrades and new works or services provided by Firetrust. 

element5 requests information from the user on the order form, viewed by the user as a page hosted on their element5 web server. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used as explained above. For example, if we have trouble processing an order, contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

Your credit card information does not pass through the element5 site under the terms of Firetrust's agreement with element5. element5 does not share credit card information with Firetrust. element5 keeps your credit card information confidential and protects your credit card information through the use of industry-standard Secure Sockets (SSL) encryption technology. 

We also use PayPal as a third-party payment provider.
