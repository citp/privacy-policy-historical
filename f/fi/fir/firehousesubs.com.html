                <b>Collecting Information</b> <br>
                <br>
                Through our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, we do not collect any 
                personally identifiable information from anyone unless that 
                person specifies it or it’s provided by someone else. For 
                example, you might be asked to voluntarily give your name, 
                postal address, email address and phone number, and credit card 
                or Pay-Pal information to us when, if to the extent possible, 
                via the FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, you purchase products from our 
                FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, provide feedback on our products, apply 
                for a job online or fill out a franchise questionnaire. We may 
                also collect and store statistics and other information about 
                the online activities of our visitors on an aggregate basis. <br>
                <br>
                At some of our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, you may be able to submit 
                information about other people. For example, while most of our 
                FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites do not engage in on-line sales, you might 
                be provided the option of ordering a gift, gift certificate or 
                any products or service online. If so, you may want it sent 
                directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name 
                and address. The types of personally identifiable information 
                that may be collected about other people at these pages may 
                include: recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, and 
                telephone number. It is also possible that someone may provide 
                us with your personally identifiable information, with or 
                without your permission.<br>
                <br>
                For reasons such as improving your experience at our Websites or 
                personalizing our Websites to you (for example, providing better 
                product recommendations or special offers that we think will 
                interest you), we may supplement the information that you 
                provide with information from third parties.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Using Your Information</b> <br>
                <br>
                Generally speaking, we make reasonable efforts to not share your 
                personally identifiable information with outside third parties 
                whose practices are not covered by this privacy policy without 
                your permission. However, to serve you better we may share 
                information about you with independently owned and operated 
                FIREHOUSE SUBS franchisees, state regulators, or product vendors 
                and others we deem necessary.<br>
                <br>
                We, FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises, or our third party vendors, may 
                access, use or disclose your personally identifiable information 
                to operate, maintain, service or improve our FIREHOUSE SUBS 
                Sites, provide targeted offers to you, analyze our FIREHOUSE 
                SUBS Sites to make any of them more effective, or for other 
                general internal business purposes, or when we believe, in our 
                sole judgement, that the law requires it. We may disclose 
                aggregated information about our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites to third 
                parties. <br>
                <br>
                We may disclose your information in response to legal process or 
                when we, in or sole judgement, believe that the law requires it, 
                for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or a law 
                enforcement agency’s request, or to protect the rights, property 
                or safety of our Website, users of our Websites, and others. In 
                addition, in the event that all or substantially all of our 
                assets or the FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites or one of the members of our 
                family of Websites, or if any of our FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises 
                are transferred or sold to another entity, personally 
                identifiable information may be transferred to the acquiring 
                entity. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Contacting You</b> <br>
                <br>
                Occasionally we or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchisees may send you email 
                communications or otherwise contact you to provide information 
                or offers that we or they think you will find useful. You can 
                choose not to receive any future emails or communications from 
                us or any FIREHOUSE SUBS franchise by following the procedure 
                described in the "Controlling or Changing Your Information" 
                section below. Please note that we or any FIREHOUSE SUBS 
                franchise may occasionally contact you for administrative 
                purposes even if you unsubscribe from our or their email lists
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Controlling or Changing Your Information</b> <br>
                <br>
                You can review, change, or request the deletion of your contact 
                information and preferences at any time by sending us an email 
                at <a href="mailto:privacy@firehousesubs.com">
                privacy@firehousesubs.com</a>&nbsp; requesting your name and 
                contact information be changed or removed from any or all of our 
                or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchisee databases. We will make best 
                efforts to update your information as soon as practicable, 
                however, to the extent that corrected or deleted information is 
                also stored in other databases or any FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises’ 
                databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or 
                deletions will immediately reach the other databases. FIREHOUSE 
                SUBS franchises are independently owned and operated by others, 
                not us. Therefore, while we will endeavor to require FIREHOUSE 
                SUBS franchises to comply with this Privacy Policy, we have no 
                responsibility to you whatsoever for FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises 
                violations of any aspect of this Privacy Policy. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Cookies </b><br>
                <br>
                We or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises may use cookies to assign a 
                unique identification to your computer. Cookies are files that 
                your browser places on your computer's hard drive, which we may 
                use to track items you have placed in your shopping cart or to 
                learn how you arrived at our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites. Cookies are 
                also used to save and retrieve your e-mail address, password and 
                preferences so you do not have to re-enter this information each 
                time you visit our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites. Please refer to your 
                Internet Browser’s instructions or help screen to learn about 
                how you can monitor your computer’s acceptance of "cookies".<br>
                <br>
                In some cases we or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises may track or 
                collect information about your use of our FIREHOUSE SUBS Site by 
                the numeric address assigned to the computer you are using (your 
                IP address) or by the URLs that you come from or leave to. These 
                methods also allow us, or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises, to resolve 
                server problems or administer our or their FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites. 
                Currently, we and FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises do not associate 
                this information with any other personally identifiable 
                information that you may have provided us or FIREHOUSE SUBS 
                franchises but we or they may do so at any time, without notice 
                to you.<br>
                <br>
                Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors <br>
                Our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites may contain links to other Websites 
                whose information practices may be different than ours. You 
                should consult these other Websites’ privacy notices, as we have 
                no control over information that is submitted to, or collected 
                by, these third parties.<br>
                <br>
                We or FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises sometimes may offer content 
                (e.g., products or promotions) that is sponsored by or 
                co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these 
                relationships, the third parties may obtain personally 
                identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to 
                participate in the FIREHOUSE SUBS Site activity. We have no 
                control over these third-parties’ use of this information. Our 
                FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites may, but are not obligated to, notify you 
                at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if 
                these third-parties will obtain such information. <br>
                <br>
                <b>A Note to Parents/Guardians</b><br>
                <br>
                We would like to help you protect your children’s privacy. 
                Please speak with your children about the importance of 
                safeguarding their personal information. We urge you to monitor 
                and supervise your children’s on-line activities. We ask anyone 
                under the age of 16 to get their parent’s approval before giving 
                us any personal information. We would be very happy to have you 
                visit the FIREHOUSE SUBS web site with your children.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b><br>
                <br>
                If we decide to materially change our Privacy Policy, we will 
                post those changes on our FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites so you will 
                always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, 
                and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Security</b> <br>
                <br>
                We may require that a secure connection between your computer 
                and our server be established before you can utilize all or a 
                portion of the FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites. To do this, we may utilize 
                a technology like Secure Socket Layers (SSL), an advanced 
                encryption technology. Currently, we do not utilize secure 
                connections with any aspect of the FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites.<br>
                <br>
                If you'd like to know if you are using a secure connection, you 
                can check the icon in the bottom left-hand corner of your Web 
                browser's window. If the icon appears as either a closed lock or 
                an unbroken key, you are communicating with us via a secure 
                connection (the form of the icon varies by browser and version 
                number). <br>
                <br>
                Although we use these industry-standard efforts to safeguard the 
                confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, 
                "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. Without 
                limiting any other limitations of liability, we have indicated 
                in this Privacy Policy, we have no responsibility whatsoever for 
                breaches of this policy caused, directly or indirectly, by, in 
                whole or in part, the illegal, unethical, malicious, 
                mischievous, or unauthorized acts of any third parties.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Our Franchisees</b><br>
                <br>
                If you are a FIREHOUSE SUBS franchisee, or an employee or agent 
                of one of the FIREHOUSE SUBS franchises, your use of our 
                FIREHOUSE SUBS Sites, will also be governed by the Terms and
