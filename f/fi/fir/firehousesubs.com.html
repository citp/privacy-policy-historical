                                        In general, through our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites, we take reasonable steps to avoid
                                        collecting any personally identifiable information from anyone unless that person
                                        specifies it or it’s provided by someone else. For example, you might be asked
                                        to voluntarily give your name, postal address, email address and phone number, and
                                        credit card or Pay-Pal Information to us when, if to the extent possible, via the
                                        FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites, you purchase products from our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites,

                                        the online activities of our visitors on an aggregate basis.</p>

                                        How we collect information about you. We collect information in 3 ways:</p>
                                    <p>
                                        1. We collect information that our customers or visitors to FIREHOUSE SUBS®
                                        Sites (including you) supply to us.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        2. We collect information from emails and other contacts sent to us by you, other
                                        customers and users of the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        3. We collect information electronically on all users of our website, including
                                        customers, by means of cookies.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Types of personal information we may collect from you and other users.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        1. Product Purchases:<br>
                                        Every time you use the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site to purchase goods or services, we
                                        may collect information about the FIREHOUSE SUBS® restaurants you select and
                                        the orders you place.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        To obtain services from the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site, you may be required to provide
                                        us with your full legal name, email address, full street address including city,
                                        state and zip code, and telephone number. And, to obtain certain services from the
                                        FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site, you may also be required to choose your “username”
                                        and /or “password” and provide those to us.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        At some our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites, you may also be able to submit information
                                        about other people. For example, while most of our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Sites do
                                        not engage in on-line sales, you might be provided the option of ordering a gift,
                                        gift certificate or any products or service online. To do so you may be required
                                        to provide us personally identifiable information. For example, when you place an
                                        order with us by telephone or means other than our online ordering service, you
                                        may be required to provide us with your full legal name, full street address including
                                        city, state and zip code, and telephone number. When or if you place an order through
                                        the FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site, you may want the item purchased sent directly to the
                                        recipient; therefore, you might submit the recipient’s name and address. The
                                        types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people
                                        at these pages may include: recipient’s name, address, e-mail address, and
                                        telephone number. It is also possible that someone may provide us with your personally
                                        identifiable information, with or without your permission.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        2. Promotions:<br>

                                        not to receive e-mails or other communications from us, we will make reasonable
                                        efforts not to provide your e-mail address, mailing address or other data or information
                                        to any third party for promotional or other commercial purposes, except with your

                                    <p>
                                        You are under no obligation to respond to any Promotion but if you do, you may be
                                        required to provide additional information, such as your birth date and whether
                                        you or anyone in your household is employed by the merchant who is extending the
                                        offer, in order to verify your eligibility for accepting the offer or participation
                                        in the Promotion. For any such Promotion, your provision of information to us or
                                        the merchant may be governed by the merchant's privacy policy, not our privacy policy.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        3. Third-Party Information:<br>
                                        For reasons such as improving your experience at our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site or
                                        personalizing our FIREHOUSE SUBS® Site to you (for example, providing better
                                        product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you), we may
                                        supplement the information that you provide with information from third parties.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        4. Information Regarding Children:<br>
