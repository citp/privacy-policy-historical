# FireClick Media - Privacy Policy

## 1.1 Survey Information. 

FireClick Media collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an FireClick Media survey, order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website, and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, FireClick Media or a third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information to FireClick Media, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). FireClick Media may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and use that information in combination with information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to FireClick Media or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from FireClick Media or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to FireClick Media. 

##  1.2 Third Party List Information.

FireClick Media collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a Third Party and FireClick Media subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information, FireClick Media seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to FireClick Media and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list. 

##  1.3 Other Information. 

Other occasions when FireClick Media obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by FireClick Media or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through FireClick Media customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a FireClick Media service or newsletter (together, "Other Information"). 

##  1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology. 

FireClick Media currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, FireClick Media may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information"). (a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows FireClick Media to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in FireClick Media’s database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral. Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website. (b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using a programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows FireClick Media to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, FireClick Media might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in FireClick Media’s database, visits the fishing website, FireClick Media receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and FireClick Media would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. FireClick Media may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, FireClick Media also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in FireClick Media’s database. (c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is FireClick Media’s use of new and evolving technology. As a result, FireClick Media strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology. 

##  1.5 Outside Information. 

FireClick Media may receive information about individuals from third parties or from other sources of information outside of FireClick Media including information located in public databases ("Outside Information"). 

##  1.6 Individual Information. 

As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside Information, and any other information FireClick Media gathers or receives about individuals such as usage data, file transfer and viewing data. 

##  1.7 No Information Collected from Children. 

FireClick Media will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If FireClick Media obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, FireClick Media has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. FireClick Media has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). 

##  1.8 Credit Card Information. 

FireClick Media may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from FireClick Media. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to FireClick Media, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. FireClick Media will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction. Log File Data: When users log-in to access their account, our servers will automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers send whenever visiting a Website. These server logs may include information vital to validating the user’s authorization to access the account. Information, such as a Web request, Internet Protocol (the “IP”) address, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed and in what order, time spent, the date and time of the request, and other important data is necessary to validate and authorize a user’s entry and activity on the Website.

This information helps FireClick Media to better understand the online habits of individuals so that FireClick Media can target advertising and promotions to them. 

## 2.6 Profiles of Individuals. 

FireClick Media uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information obtained from public databases.

FireClick Media stores the Individual Information in a database on FireClick Media computers. Our computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under FireClick Media’s control.
