#### Swift Payments

International payments and certain domestic payments are made by us via the Belguim based **Society for World Interbank Financial Telecommunication** ("SWIFT"). SWIFT processes these types of payments on behalf of financial institutions worldwide and is currently the only organisation providing such a service. Records of all transactions processed by SWIFT in Belgium are replicated in a backup system ("mirror site") in the US, thereby maintaining a geographically separated back-up infrastructure to ensure that the continued operation of the SWIFT system is in line with international standards and supervisory requirements.

On foot of US legal subpoena(s) served on SWIFT, transaction data held in the US "mirror site" may be disclosed to the US government, its various departments and agencies (including law enforcement), or other national, state or international authorities for the purposes of combating terrorism and other serious crime.

Therefore, any information you provide to us in order to effect a SWIFT payment could potentially be disclosed to US authorities, and by instructing us to execute a payment, you are implicitly giving your consent to such disclosure and agree that we shall have no liability to you in respect of any such disclosure.

We reserve the right to amend this notice at any time, and you should regularly check for any amendments.
