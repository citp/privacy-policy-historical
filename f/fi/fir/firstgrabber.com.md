### Cookies 

FirstGrabber may, at times, use cookies. Cookies are data files stored on your computer that identify you as a unique user. Cookies enable us to track user trends, preferences and patterns to better understand our user base and to improve the quality of our service. Most browsers permit users to refuse cookies or to be notified before a cookie is accepted. You can visit our site without using cookies.

### Third Party Cookies

FirstGrabber may, at times, drop third party web beacons. Opting out of third parties' services will prevent them from collecting data when a user visits any of FirstGrabber's partner/customer sites. By doing so, advertisements will no longer be tailored to your interests.

Note that after choosing to opt out, if you use a different computer or a different browser, or if you delete or block browser cookies, you may need to repeat the opt-out steps. Most web browsers also enable you to block browser cookies. You can refer to your web browser's documentation to get more information on how to block or delete cookies directly through your browser settings.
