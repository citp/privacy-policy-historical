# First Flight Couriers Ltd.

**Protection of Customer Information** We understand the importance of privacy to our customers and visitors to FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED web sites.  For many years, our policy has been to treat what we learn about our customers as confidential.  For example, we will not give or sell confidential or Personal Information (as described below) about our customer to any third party not affiliated with their transaction, except as required by law or as necessary to provide FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED services to the customer.

We collect and store information about every package we handle so that we can efficiently provide the package delivery services demanded by our customers.  We use information about our customers, their packages, and their shipping activity to provide or enhance the services we make available to our customers, communicate with our customers about additional services they may find of value, satisfy our legitimate business interests (including performing trend analysis and market studies), set prices, establish credit, fulfill a Contract of Carriage or Service Agreement, accomplish the billing function, and comply with government regulations.  Although government regulations vary in the many countries in which we operate, they frequently include the reporting of information to transportation, safety, customs, and other regulatory agencies.

As we collect and use information about our customers, we may contract with vendors to assist us in processing that information for those purposes listed in the previous paragraph.  These vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are restricted from using the information for any other purpose.  In addition, as FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED continues to develop its business, we may buy or sell subsidiaries or business units.  As part of these transactions, customer information of the subsidiaries or business units may be one of the transferred assets. 

Some of the information collected by FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED is data which relates to an identifiable person ("Personal Information").  Examples of Personal Information are names, addresses, e-mail addresses, credit card numbers and telephone numbers.  We never sell information to third parties that could be used to specifically identify an individual customer or group of customers.  Anonym zed data, with all names, addresses and other Personal Information removed, is sometimes shared with third parties.  Finally, we do provide Personal Information to government agencies as required by law or regulation.

In addition to the uses of the information described in the paragraphs above, we collect telephone numbers and e-mail addresses in the event that we have to contact the shipper, or the shipment recipient or addressee, to resolve a question or provide shipment status information.

**Shipment Information**

Information, including Personal Information, provided as part of a shipping transaction represents a record of that business transaction and cannot be altered after the transaction is complete except as provided in the FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED Terms and Conditions.  Although we make reasonable efforts to limit access to our facilities and vehicles to authorized personnel, we are not responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of information that is printed and placed in plain view on a package or letter.

**Security and Integrity of Information**

We treat our data as assets that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access.  We employ information security techniques to appropriately protect confidential information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.  Access to customer information is limited to those employees who have a legitimate business need for that information.

FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED Web Sites, and their supporting systems, employ generally accepted information security techniques such as firewalls, access control procedures and cryptography to appropriately protect confidential information from unauthorized access.

**Retention of Customer Information**

We retain information, including Personal Information, about customers as necessary for business purposes and as required by government regulation.  For example, we retain information about packages, including names and addresses, so that we can provide proof of delivery information and to process claim requests.  We carefully dispose of records and delete information when retention periods expire.

**Customers are Responsible for Protecting Information and Systems on Their Premises**

Some information about FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED customers and their packages is stored in shipping systems located on customer premises.  Customers concerned about the security of their information in these systems should secure it by activating passwords and using physical access controls.  When these systems (hardware or software) are provided by FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED, we provide tools to facilitate customer efforts to safeguard their information. 

**The FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED Web Sites**

The following paragraphs describe our commitment to the protection of Personal Information as it applies to the FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED Web Sites, which are web sites controlled or operated by a FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED entity (such as a FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED business unit) or a FIRST FLIGHT COURIERS LIMITED affiliate, unless the web site expressly publishes a different or modified privacy policy.
