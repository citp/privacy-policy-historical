			   make informed choices about the management of personal information.</font><br><br>
			  
			   <font class="bodyhead">Information Covered by this Policy</font><br><br>
			  
			   <font class="bodycontent">Our Policy applies to all personally identifiable financial information about you that is 
			   obtained by Bank One in connection with providing a consumer financial product or 
			   service for personal, family, or household purposes ("personal information").&nbsp; Our Policy 
			   will continue to cover information we may collect about you during the course of our 
			   relationship as well as after the relationship has ended.</font><br><br>
			  
			   <font class="bodyhead">How We Collect Personal Information</font><br><br>
			  
			   <font class="bodycontent">We rely on many sources of information to understand and meet your needs.&nbsp; We collect 
			   personal information about you from:<br><br>
			   <ul type="disc">
			   <li type="disc"> your applications or in other ways when you visit us in person, over the phone, 
			   through the mail or through our websites;</li>
			   <li type="disc"> your browser, when you visit our websites and your browser interacts with us;</li>
			   <li type="disc"> your transactions with any of the companies in the Bank One family;</li>
			   <li type="disc"> consumer reporting agencies; and</li>
			   <li type="disc"> other sources, in connection with providing you a financial product or service.</li></ul></font>
			  
			   <font class="bodyhead">How We Keep Information Secure</font><br><br>
			  
			   <font class="bodycontent">Information security is one of our highest priorities.&nbsp; This priority is 
			   emphasized by our internal employee Code of Conduct, this Privacy Policy, and the contracts and agreements 
			   that we sign with external suppliers and partners.&nbsp; Employees who violate our policies and procedures 
			   regarding privacy are subject to disciplinary action, and our partners and suppliers are bound to uphold our 
			   procedures regarding privacy under the terms of our legal contracts with them.&nbsp; We safeguard information 
			   by regularly assessing security standards and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to personal 
			   information.<br><br>
			  
			   We limit access to personal information about you to those employees who need to know 
			   that information to provide products and services to you.&nbsp; We maintain physical, 
			   electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your 
			   personal information.</font><br><br>
			  
			   <font class="bodyhead">Information Sharing Within the Bank One Family and Your Opportunity to “Opt Out”</font><br><br>
			  
			   <font class="bodycontent">People often tell us that they prefer a financial services provider that takes an “integrated 
			   approach.”&nbsp; They want us to understand a range of needs and make recommendations 
			   about a variety of financial services.&nbsp; For this reason and others, we may share any of the 
			   personal information that we collect about you among companies within the Bank One 
			   family.<br><br>
			  
			   The Fair Credit Reporting Act gives you the opportunity to limit the sharing of “non-
			   experience information” within the Bank One family.&nbsp; “Non-experience information” 
			   includes information that is used, expected to be used, or collected for the purpose of 
			   establishing your eligibility for consumer credit, insurance or deposit accounts, and is not 
			   related solely to your transactions or other experiences with us, including information:<br><br>
			   <ul type="disc">
			   <li type="disc"> from your applications, such as your income or marital status;</li>
			   <li type="disc"> from a credit report, such as your credit history; and</li>
			   <li type="disc"> from sources used to verify representations made by you, such as your open lines of 
			   credit or employment history.</li></ul>
			  
			   The types of companies within the Bank One family that may receive non-
			   experience information include financial service providers, such as:<br><br>
			   <ul type="disc">
			   <li type="disc"> banks;</li>
			   <li type="disc"> broker-dealers; and</li>
			   <li type="disc"> insurance agents.</li></ul>
			  
			   <b>If you prefer that we not share non-experience information about you within the 
			   Bank One family of companies, you may opt out, that is, you may direct us not to 
			   share this information, by calling us toll-free at 1-800-869-9638.</b><br><br>
			  
			   If you choose to opt out of the sharing of this information within the Bank One family, 
			   we will not share non-experience information about you for any accounts or loans that 
			   you may have with us.&nbsp; For any accounts or loans that you hold jointly with another 
			   person, each person may separately opt out and joint account holders may opt out for 
			   each other.&nbsp; If only one joint account holder opts out, we may share information about the 
			   other joint account holders.&nbsp; Choosing to opt out of this information sharing may limit 
			   opportunities for you to receive product and service information that may interest you.<br><br>
			  
			   <b>Information Sharing Outside the Bank One Family and Your Opportunity to “Opt Out”</b><br><br>
			  
			   We may share any of the personal information that we collect about you with companies 
			   or other organizations outside of the Bank One family, including:<br><br>
			   <ul type="disc">
			   <li type="disc"> financial service providers, such as mortgage bankers, securities broker-dealers and insurance agents;</li>
			   <li type="disc"> non-financial companies, such as retailers, direct marketers, membership clubs and 
			   publishers; and</li>
			   <li type="disc"> other companies and organizations, such as non-profit organizations.</li></ul>
			  
			   <b>If you prefer that we not share personal information about you with companies and 
			   organizations outside the Bank One family (except information described below 
			   under “Other Information Sharing”), you may opt out, that is, you may direct us 
			   not to share this information, by calling us toll-free at 1-800-869-9638.</b><br><br>
			  
			   If you choose to opt out of the sharing of personal information with companies and

			   about you for any accounts or loans that you may have with us.&nbsp; For any accounts or 
			   loans that you hold jointly with another person, each person may separately opt out and 
			   joint account holders may opt out for each other.&nbsp; If only one joint account holder opts 
			   out, we may share information about the other joint account holders.&nbsp; Choosing to 
			   opt out of this information sharing may limit opportunities for you to 
			   receive product and service information that may interest you.</font><br><br>
			  
			   <font class="bodyhead">Other Information Sharing</font><br><br>
			  
			   <font class="bodycontent">We may also share personal information about you with companies or other organizations 
			   outside of the Bank One family as required by or permitted by law.&nbsp; For example, we may 
			   share personal information to:<br><br>

			   <li type="disc"> protect against fraud;</li>
			   <li type="disc"> respond to a subpoena; or</li>
			   <li type="disc"> service your account.</li></ul>
			  
			   In addition, Bank One may work with companies or organizations outside of the Bank 
			   One family to provide services to Bank One or to provide you with opportunities to buy 
			   products or services offered by Bank One or jointly with other financial institutions.&nbsp;   
			   Consequently, we may disclose any of the personal information that we have collected 
			   about you to:<br><br>
			   <ul type="disc">
			   <li type="disc"> other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements; and</li>
			   <li type="disc"> companies that perform services, including marketing services, for us or for us and the 
			   financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.</li></ul>
			  
			   For your protection, we require that these companies keep all personal information secure 
			   and confidential.</font><br><br>
