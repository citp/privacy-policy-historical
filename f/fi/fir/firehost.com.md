The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Armor.

**EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield**

Armor has offices in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Therefore, it is possible that your information may be available to these offices.  To ensure adequate protection of the transfer of your personal information to these jurisdictions, Armor participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  We are committed to subjecting all personal information received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland to the Framework’s applicable Principles. Armor is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. [ **[https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/)** ]

Armor is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework, and may subsequently provide personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf.  Armor complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.  That is, if we transfer personal information received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, Armor will obtain assurances from the third party that they will safeguard personal information in a manner consistent with our obligations under the Privacy Shield. We will remain responsible under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party, unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Armor ’s adherence to the Privacy Shield may be limited in circumstances where Armor may be required to disclose personal information such as in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement requirements, or as required by statute, government regulation, or court order.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at  **<https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>**.

Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [ **<https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint>** ], you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the Client that you interact with directly. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Armor’s Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

**Data Integrity and Security**

Armor makes diligent efforts to maintain accurate information on our customers. Armor has put stringent security procedures in place to protect such information collected about our customers. We constantly monitor our systems, which are protected using industry-standard security measures.

Although reasonable efforts are made to secure network communications and the Site, Armor cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

  * what we have done with your personal information;
  * to whom we have communicated your personal information;
  * where your personal information has been stored, processed or transferred;
  * how long we will retain your personal information, or how that retention period will be determined; and
  * the safeguards in place to protect your information when it is transferred to third parties or third countries.



Finally, you can ask us not to collect or use your personal information for certain purposes, you can ask us to delete your personal information, or you can ask us to provide your personal information to a third party.

Depending on which laws apply to your personal information, we may only be able to do some of these things for you.
