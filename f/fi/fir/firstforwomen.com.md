_**How We Collect Information**_

This site collects no personally identifying information except when you specifically and knowingly provide it. You can browse our site without entering any personal information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit.

The membership web site logs IP addresses and browser types, but we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user’s session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

To serve your needs and interests better, we collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis.

In those instances where we do collect personally identifiable information, you have the option of choosing to reveal it to us. Examples of when you voluntarily submit this kind of information include when you answer our polls, enter sweepstakes or contests, fill out the Member Registration page, send us feedback or post in chat rooms or message boards.

In the event of a complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information about you from other parties in our network or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.

_**Contests, Sweepstakes & Advertiser Promotions**_

Personal information is collected on our web site on Entry Forms for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions. All information entered on these Entry Forms is shared with the advertiser(s) and sponsor(s) of the particular event.

_**Membership Registration Form**_

We encourage visitors to register as a Member. Our Member registration form asks users for name, email address, preferences, and various types of demographic information.

Benefits of Membership include the convenience of having your basic identification information pre-filled in on sweepstakes and contest entry forms, and the ability to enter promotions or enjoy offers that are for Members Only.

As a registered Member, your name and email address are used to update you via email newsletters on new First for Women magazine issues and articles, new contests and sweepstakes, and special offers. If you would rather not receive email newsletters from us, but would still like to register, please indicate your preference by marking the appropriate box presented on the registration form.

Occasionally, we like to present you with special offers from our partners. This involves sharing your information with them so they can send you the offer. If you prefer, you can choose that your information not be shared with our partners by indicating your preference on the registration form.

Preferences and demographic information are used to help us improve our services. The more we know about you, the better we can serve you.

_**How We Use and Disclose Your Information**_

As a general practice, we do not sell your personally identifiable information to third parties. So, for example, we do not sell your email addresses or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers.

In some situations, we share your personally identifiable information with third parties who provide services to our network in order to enhance the functionality available to you as part of the network, and to provide you with new products and services such as email and Member pages.

_**Controlling or Changing Your Information**_

You can access and update your personal information and email preferences by going to the Membership Registration area of the website and following the instructions on that page. You may also email us at [FFWwebmaster@tmagusa.com](mailto:FFWwebmaster@tmagusa.com) to request a copy of your current information and to indicate updates to that information.

_**Cookies and Other Tracking Methods**_

Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. We may use cookies or, in a limited number of cases, IP addresses for a number of reasons. First, cookies allow you to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it. Second, cookies can also help us to tailor a Web site or a marketing message to better match your needs and interests. Third, cookies allow us to better understand how users use our site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly if you do.

**Note:** We may place advertising on our site that originates from outside advertisers and/or advertising agencies. In some cases, if you click on or view these ads, the advertiser may assign a cookie. First for Women's website does not control these cookies.

_**Other Sites**_

When you click on a link to another website from First for Women website, you have left our website. Our privacy policy does not extend to sites outside of the First for Women website.

_**Security**_

We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers where appropriate. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

We hope this policy clarifies our procedures regarding your personal information.
