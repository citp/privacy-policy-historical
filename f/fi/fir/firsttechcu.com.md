**First Tech Credit Union Privacy Policy**  
October, 2009 

At First Tech Credit Union, respecting and protecting your privacy is important to us. This notice describes First Tech’s information collection and sharing practices and allows you to choose whether First Tech may share certain information about you. This notice is the joint privacy policy of First Tech Credit Union and our credit union affiliate, TCU Group Services, Inc. which does business as First Tech Financial Services, First Tech Insurance Services, Technology Insurance NW and First Tech Professional Services. 

We recognize the importance of our responsibility in protecting our members’ nonpublic personal information. We will protect the personal and financial information that you have entrusted to us. We believe that all personal and financial information that you provide to us through any channel constitutes personal information. This includes: information you provide on an application to obtain membership, a loan, credit card or other financial product or service; account balance information, payment history, overdraft history, and credit or debit card purchase information; the fact that you are or have been one of our members; any information collected through a cookie; and any information from your consumer report. 

**1.Collection of Personal Information**  
When you apply for an account or service from the credit union or our financial service affiliate, we collect and retain nonpublic personal information in order to process your application. We collect the information you provide on your applications and other forms (such as name address, assets, income and employer) and information from a consumer reporting agency (such as your credit history and public records). When you open or use an account or service, we retain personal information you provide in the context of using that product or service, including transaction information. After you sign up for our online services [First Tech Online] our data system records certain online information, including the transactions you conduct online. This data enables us to process and confirm your transactions. When you send us e-mail, we will retain the content of the e-mail, your e-mail address, and our response in order to handle any follow up questions you may have. We also use it to measure how effectively we address your concerns. 

**2.Use and Sharing of Personal Information**  
In order to provide financial services to you, we share certain information about you with our financial service affiliate and third party service providers. However, we limit any information sharing to the extent necessary to service your account. If we share your information, it is with the goal of bringing you quality services, more choices and greater convenience. Information we may have about former members is generally only shared or disclosed if required to enforce or administer an account or as required by law. 

**3.Sharing Information within First Tech**  
Our wholly owned financial service affiliate provides financial services including insurance, tax preparation services and auto purchasing. We may share the following information with our affiliate so they can serve you more efficiently: 

  * Member information such as name, address or account number 
  * Account information such as type of loan or share accounts



Because we maintain management control over our financial service affiliate, you can expect our affiliate to maintain the same privacy standards as the Credit Union. You may limit our affiliates from marketing their products or services to you based on the information that we share with them. 

**4.Sharing Information with Third Party Service Providers**  
In order for us to conduct our operations, including servicing your account or processing your transactions, we need to share information with our service providers. The credit union’s service providers include: data processing companies; check, ATM and other payment processing companies; payment networks; loan service providers; insurance companies; collection agencies; and credit reporting agencies. Our financial service affiliates service providers include: data processing companies; insurance companies; payment networks and credit reporting agencies. These service providers act on our behalf and have agreed in writing to keep the information we provide to them confidential. We share the following categories of information with third party service providers depending on the specific services provided: 

  * Member information such as name, address or account number 
  * Account information such as type of accounts, account balances or transaction history 
  * Transaction information such as dates, amounts, locations and type of transaction



The Credit Union and affiliate does not sell or share any member information with nonaffiliated third party marketers offering their products and services. 

While we may offer valuable financial products and services of our affiliate or third parties, we control the member information used to make such offers. We currently offer members insurance products offered by Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance, and Capstone Financial Assurance, Long Term Care Specialist. You may tell us not to offer these services to you as explained in the Opt Out section of this notice. 

**5.Sharing Information as Legally Required or Permitted**

**7.Protection of Personal Information**  
Protecting your privacy is an ongoing process. We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We will continue to review the measures we take to safeguard your personal information. These reviews will result in new measures to protect member records, as we make changes to our information security practices and other internal control systems to take advantage of new technology. Non-public personal information you provide online applications is secure and requires industry standard Secure Socket Layer encrypted browsers.
