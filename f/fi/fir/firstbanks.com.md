We use persistent cookies to keep track of your activities when you visit our website or our advertisers' websites, and to serve you relevant advertisements. Our advertising partners also place persistent cookies on your device when you visit our website in order to help us recognize you and serve relevant advertisements to you when you visit websites in their networks.  Here's how it works: When you visit our website, a pixel on our site causes a cookie to be set in your browser. When you visit one of our advertising partner's websites or a website in one of their networks, the advertising partner will recognize your browser. The advertising partner may then serve a First Bank ad on the advertiser’s website. The advertising partner then may track how many times it shows you an ad from First Bank and whether you clicked on the ad. Our policy is that our advertising partners only collect non-personally identifiable information via these cookies and we will cease working with partners found violating this policy.
