# First Choice | Our Policies | Privacy Policy

## What does First Choice do with my information?

Here are a few things you should know:

  * We don't collect personal information about you as you browse. The only way to do so is for you to give it to us
  * The only info we need is that which enables us to book your holiday for you - for example your name, address and credit/debit card details
  * We do not disclose your personal information to third parties except for the purpose of completing your transaction, providing booking services to you and obtaining professional advice
  * We may use your information to contact you regarding your holiday booking  




In addition:

  * We may wish to contact you for feedback or to provide details of other products and offers from First Choice (a trading name of TUI UK Ltd) and other divisions within the group of companies of TUI UK Ltd.
  * We may send your information to selected trading partners and third parties so that they can contact you regarding travel- and non-travel-related products and services that you may be interested in



Don't worry - you can opt out of these if you want to. Just tick the appropriate box on the 'Payment Details' page when you're making your booking.

You can also change your preference at any time, or receive further information, by contacting us at:

Direct Marketing Department, First Choice Holidays  
First Choice House  
London Road  
CRAWLEY  
West Sussex  
RH10 9GX

Also any contact with First Choice, either online or by telephone, may be recorded for training and monitoring purposes. 

### Where is my personal information stored?

We store your information in secure databases at secure addresses to prevent unauthorised access.

### What is a 'cookie'?

In website terms, a cookie is a small file sent to your browser (e.g. Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox) and stored on your computer's hard disk. Cookies identify the computer you are using, not you personally.

### How does First Choice use cookies?

Cookies perform three functions on our website.

  * They speed up the booking process. They do this by remembering information you have previously entered (such as your name and holidays you've already searched for) so that you don't have to re-enter it time and time again
  * They measure how much our website is being used, and for what purposes. For example, we can see how many people visit certain pages, visitor exit points, details of searches performed and so forth. This information helps us to give you a better and more helpful visitor experience
  * For purchases, cookies keep track of your transaction from one page to the next



And that's it. We don't store your password with them, or any other information for that matter.

### How will I know if you change this privacy policy?

Any changes to our Privacy Policy will be made to this page. Your continued use of the website signifies your agreement to any modified Terms and Conditions.

### What about the other sites you link to?

First Choice Holidays, including its owners, employees and contractors, is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of sites that we link to.

In addition, our ABTA (Association of British Travel Agents) protection does not apply to any non-ABTA registered websites to which we link.

### Data protection information

We take full responsibility for ensuring that security measures are in place to protect your information. We're registered in accordance with applicable data protection legislation in the UK.

We need to pass on relevant information to suppliers such as your hotel, airline and transport companies - otherwise we can't make your booking. We won't pass your details on to anyone who isn't directly responsible for part of your travel arrangements.

This also applies to any sensitive information you have provided, such as disabilities, dietary or religious requirements. When you make your booking, this signifies your consent for your information to be passed on to the necessary parties.

Your info may also be provided to security or credit checking companies, public authorities such as customs/immigration if necessary, or as required by law.

From March 05, 2003, the US and UK governments, customs and immigration authorities require access to passenger information from airlines. Other countries may follow in the future.

If your holiday is outside the European Economic Area (EEA), please be aware that controls on data protection in your destination may not be as strict as in the UK.

You are entitled to a copy of the information you have provided to First Choice. Please contact us if you would like to arrange this. We may make a small administration charge for doing this.

### Consent information

Disclosing your information to us via phone or online signifies your consent to the collection, storage and processing of your info by First Choice as stated in this Privacy Policy.
