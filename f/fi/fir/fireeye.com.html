	<h2>FireEye Online Privacy Statement</h2>
	<p>FireEye respects your privacy. When using our site, you may get information, communicate with us or link to other Web sites with which we do business. While doing that, you may give us information so that we can provide enhanced products or services to you and to personalize your experience on our Web site. This online privacy policy describes how we use and protect Individual Identifying Information that you share with us. "Individual Identifying Information" is information that enables us to identify you, such as your email address, name, title and mailing address.</p>
	<p>Your privacy, and the privacy of all users of www.fireeye.com, is of the highest priority. If you have any questions, please email us.  We will not knowingly collect or use personal identifying information from children younger than 13 without parental consent.</p>
	<p>This policy governs Web-sites owned and operated by FireEye. Our policy does not govern Web-sites of other parties to which we may provide links, because FireEye is not responsible, and can not control the privacy practices or content of those sites.</p>
	<p>Here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web sites:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Information Collection and Use</li>
	<li>Information Sharing and Disclosure</li>
	<li>Questions or Suggestions</li>
	<li>IP Information Collection and Use Practices</li>
	<li>Cookies</li>
	<li>Data Storage</li>
	<li>Contact Us</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>FireEye collects Individual Identifying Information when you register for FireEye information, visit FireEye pages, and when you enter webinars or promotions. FireEye may also receive Individual Identifying Information from our business partners.</li>
	<li>FireEye also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, FireEye cookie information and the page you requested.</li>
	<li>FireEye uses information for these general purposes: to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials and new products.</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>FireEye will not sell or rent your Individual Identifying Information to anyone.</li>
	<li>FireEye will send Individual Identifying Information about you to other companies or people when:</li>
		<ul>
        	<li>We have your consent to share the information;</li>
		<li>We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested;</li>
		<li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of FireEye to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the Individual Identifying Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.);</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<h3>Questions or Suggestions</h3>

	<p>If you have questions or suggestions complete a feedback form or send an email to info@fireeye.com.</p>

	<h3>IP Information Collection and Use Practices</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>FireEye receives IP addresses from all users because this information is automatically reported by your browser each time you view a Web page.</li>
	<li>When a FireEye Web page is requested and viewed, that request is logged on our servers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page.</li>
	<li>IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to estimate the total number of users visiting FireEye from specific countries or regions of the world.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.</p>
	<p>Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</p>

	<u>Choices about Cookies</u>
	<ul>
	<li>You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)</li>
  	</ul>

	<u>FireEye's Practices Regarding Cookies</u>
	<p>FireEye uses cookies for a number of purposes, including to:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>So that we can provide you with customized content.</li>
	<li>Keep track of preferences you specify while you are using FireEye's services.</li>
	<li>Estimate and report our total audience size and traffic.</li>
	<li>Conduct research to improve FireEye's content and services.</li>
	<li>Require you to re-enter your FireEye password after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Data Storage</h3>
	<u>Account Information</u>
	<ul>
	<li>When you submit information to FireEye, a temporary copy of that information is routinely made to prevent accidental loss of your information through a computer malfunction or human error.</li>
	<li>Please note that any information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request. This may be the case even though no information about your account remains in our active user databases.</li>
	</ul>

  	
	<u>Servers</u>
	<ul>
	<li>The FireEye computers (called "servers") that send your Web pages process and store an enormous amount of information every day. These computer records are called "log files."</li>
	<li>Log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other purposes, as described above. After this information has been used, it is stored and is inaccessible. Until the information is stored, your FireEye ID may remain in our active server log files.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Contact Us</h3>
	<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact info@fireeye.com.</p>
