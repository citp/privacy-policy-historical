This Policy explains the practices that apply to information ("Personal Information") that you provide to us that can be used to easily identify or contact you or others personally. 

### Collection of Your Personal Information

In order to provide the Firetalk Services, we must collect your phone number so we can identify you when you interact with our system, and to route telephone calls from other users to your phone. We also obtain a copy of your entire contact list, which we use to provide the Firetalk Services to you and to identify relationships between users in your contact list and other Firetalk users. Never, under any circumstances, do we reveal your contact list to other Firetalk users. As with regular phone calls, your telephone number is revealed to people you call.

Firetalk is not to be used for illegal activity. In the event that legal authorities deem it necessary to investigate a Firetalk user's activity, by way of legal processes (court order, search warrant or subpoena), we will comply as required by law. 

We may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to enhance and personalize your experience with the Firetalk Services. This includes helping authenticate your identity when you login to Firetalk; remembering your preferences and registration information; and measuring and researching the effectiveness of the Firetalk Services and promotions. 

In the event Firetalk is acquired, consolidates or merges with another company, we will share your Personal Information with the acquiring company, but only so long as that company agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Policy.
