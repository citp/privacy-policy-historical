      <p>The Privacy Policy has been updated as of May 9, 2018
</p>
<h1>Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. (“we” or “our”) has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy on the Internet. This Privacy Policy applies to the information gathering and dissemination practices for websites and applications operated by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. and its affiliates that link to it (the “Web Services”). This Privacy Policy is designed to inform you about the types of information that we may collect from you when you use our Web Services. It explains how we use and disclose that information and your rights in relation to that information. The process for notifying you of any changes to our Privacy Policy is discussed at the end of this document. Each time you use the Web Services the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. We encourage you to frequently review our Privacy Policy and note the effective date listed at the bottom.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy only applies to the information we collect from your accessing of the Web Services through a computer or other device such as a mobile phone. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected in any other way such as offline. Our Web Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. Our Special Information for Parents section contains more information regarding our policies regarding use of our Web Services by children.
</p>
<p>The Web Services may also contain links to websites or applications operated by others. This Privacy Policy does not reflect the privacy practices of those sites and applications, and we encourage you to consult their respective privacy policies to learn about their privacy practices. Other Wolters Kluwer affiliate websites and Web-enabled and accessible products and services may operate under separate privacy policies.
</p>
<p>By entering or using our Web Services, you are consenting to our collection and use of your data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

</ul>

</p>
<ul>

	<li>
	<h3>Data from Third Parties</h3>We may use information from automated tracking technologies on third party websites, other data you may have made publicly available or data provided by third party sources, such as marketing opt-in lists, or data aggregators.</li>
	<li>
	<h3>Third Party Collection of Information</h3>We use various third-party vendors to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information of our Web Services.  We may use services hosted by third parties, such as analytics services, to assist in providing our services and to help us understand how you use the Web Services. This information about your use of Web Services (including your IP address) may be transmitted to, and stored at, our data warehouses or our vendors’.We may send you emails which could contain certain cookies, web beacons and tokens which enable us to, among other things, determine whether you have opened or forwarded the email and/or clicked on links contained in the email. We use this information to customize advertisements and other messages you may receive, even after you have closed the email, and to determine whether you have made any inquiries or purchases in response to the email. These technical methods may enable us or our third party vendors to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.We may also use third party vendors to identify users and deliver interest-based content and advertisements. Our partners may collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID and information about your browser or operating system, may combine our Personal Information and Other Information about you with information from other sources, and may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</li>
	<li>
	<h3>Automated Tracking Technologies</h3>We may automatically collect information about your use of the Web Services through the technologies described below. The following descriptions are designed to provide you with additional detail about our current approach to information collected from automated tracking technologies.<em>Web Utilization Data</em>. Our servers automatically capture and save Web Utilization Data. Examples of such information include:
	<ul>
		<li>Your unique Internet protocol address;</li>
		<li>The name of your unique Internet service provider;</li>
		<li>The city, state, and country from which you access our sites;</li>
		<li>The kind of browser or computer you use;</li>
		<li>The number of links you click within the sites;</li>
		<li>The date and time of your visit;</li>
		<li>The web page from which you arrived to our sites;</li>
		<li>The pages you viewed on the sites; and</li>
		<li>Certain searches/queries that you conducted via our sites.</li>
	</ul><em>Web Beacons</em>. We use Web beacons, HTML5 local storage and other similar technologies to (i) manage access to and use of the Web Services, (ii) provide personalization and (iii) help us understand what services our visitors are accessing and how much time they spend accessing them.<em>Flash Cookies</em>. To personalize your visit, our websites and applications may use local shared objects, known as "Flash cookies", to store your preferences or display content based on your use of our websites.  Flash cookies collect and store different information than browser cookies. Your browser’s cookie management tools may not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118"><u>http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118</u></a>.<em>Device Information</em>. We may collect information about the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access the Web Services. Such information may include your IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.<em>Location Information</em>. If you enable certain location-based features, our Web Services may be able to deliver content based on your current location. If you choose to enable the feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by our application. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an application does not contain that feature, the application will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information.<em><span class="text-bold">“Do Not Track” Signals</span></em>. Some Web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to Web sites that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. However, these Web browsers communicate “Do Not Track” signals differently, making it unworkable to consistently honor such requests. As a result, our Web Services are not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals.</li>
	<li>

This is called “Interest-based Advertising”.  In addition, certain third parties may collect data on our website and combine this data with information collected from other websites for purposes that include Interest based Advertising as described above in our “Third Party Collection of Information” section.
