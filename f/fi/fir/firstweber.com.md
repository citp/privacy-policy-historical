Thank you for visiting First Weber’s website. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and we will use any personal information you provide to us while visiting this website only according to this policy. By accessing this website, you give us your consent to collect and use certain personal information as described in this policy. Because we update this policy from time to time, you should regularly review this page to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this policy.

### What information do we collect?

When you visit this website, we may collect anonymous information about you including what web pages you visited, what properties you viewed, what search criteria you used, and which websites directed you to this website. You also may agree to voluntarily provide us with personal information such as your name, home and e-mail address, and phone number.

### How do we use the information?

We may collect and use the information listed above to better understand our customers’ needs and to help us to provide them with better services and a more efficient online experience. We do not share or sell your personal information with or to any unaffiliated persons or businesses.

### How do we protect your personal information?

We are committed to protecting the security and privacy of your personal information. To prevent the unauthorized access to or the disclosure of your information, we’ve created physical and electronic systems and procedures to safeguard the information we collect. There is, however, always some risk that the information you provide to us through this website may be compromised. Although we maintain commercially reasonable security practices to safeguard your information, we cannot guarantee the security of that information. Therefore, we, and anyone else we hire or retain to maintain or operate this website, will not be responsible or liable to you for the unlawful conduct of third parties.

### Do we use cookies?

We and our technology partners employ the widely accepted practice of sending “cookies” (small text files containing a short sequence of characters) to computers that access this website. We use cookies to personalize your website experience (for example, to indicate that you are logged into My First Weber) and to gather anonymous information so that we can analyze trends in website traffic. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can always change your browser settings to prevent cookies from being placed on your computer. Even if you choose not to allow cookies from this website, you can still use the website’s general home-search feature and every other function. Cookies alone, though, cannot be used to discover your identity and we will not know your individual identity unless you provide us with that information.

### Why are there hyperlinks to other websites?

This website may contain hyperlinks to other websites. But those websites are not governed by this policy and we will not be responsible for any other website’s content or security or for protecting your information once you leave this website. When visiting other websites, you should always exercise caution and review their privacy policies.
