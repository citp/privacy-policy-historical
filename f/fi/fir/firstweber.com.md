# Privacy Policy | First Weber Realtors

## Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting First Weber’s consumer applications. We value our customers and want to address any privacy concerns you may have. To that end, we have set forth our Privacy Policy for handling the information you share with us when using First Weber’s consumer applications. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and wish you to know that any personal information you provide to us while visiting our consumer applications will be used only according to this policy. By accessing First Weber’s consumer applications, you give us your consent to collect and use certain personal information as described in this policy. Because we update this policy from time to time, you should regularly review our Privacy Policy to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this policy.

### What information do we collect?

When you visit First Weber’s consumer applications, we may collect anonymous information about you including what web pages you visited, what properties you viewed, what search criteria you used, and which application directed you to our consumer applications. You also may agree to voluntarily provide us with personal information such as your name, home and e-mail address, and optionally, your phone number, and other information as you may provide. Some of our consumer applications include registration forms, such as creating a My First Weber account, that require users to give us contact information, including your name and email address. Other functions such as requesting a Free Market Analysis will additionally request your physical address for the analysis. Customer contact information will be shared internally between our consumer applications, e.g., website and app., so that you would not need to register more than once.

### How do we use the information?

Information you may share with us while using the consumer applications is used to customize your online experience and so that we might may better understand our customers’ needs, and to help us to provide you with better services and a more efficient online experience. On occasion, we use your identification information to validate your identity. As for usage tracking data, we primarily use that information to operate and improve our consumer applications, and to further our marketing efforts. Information you provide is shared internally to provide the requested service and with the selected or assigned real estate professional(s), if applicable. However, we do not share or sell your personal information with any outside persons, entities, or services.

You may instruct us not to send communications to you by following the procedure indicated below under “Contacting Us.”

### Do we use cookies?

We and our technology partners employ the widely accepted practice of sending “cookies” (small text files containing a short sequence of characters) to computers, web server logs, and other web tools. We use cookies to personalize your consumer applications experience (for example, to indicate that you are logged into My First Weber) and to gather anonymous information so that we can analyze trends in online traffic. Such tracking data may include, but is not limited to, the date and time of your visit, the time spent on the application, the web pages viewed, and other consumer applications you visit, and tracks search queries, and basic information from computer-to-computer identifying unique visitors, including IP address, browser type and service provider, but not the identity of the visitor, unless you choose to share that information. This technology allows us to customize your online experience as well as track your use of our system so that we can improve your experience.

Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can always change your browser settings to prevent cookies from being placed on your computer. You may deactivate cookies if you do not want your browsing to be tracked, but doing so may hinder your online experience. However, even if you choose not to allow cookies from our consumer applications, you can still use the website’s general home-search feature and other functions. Again, cookies do not provide your identity, and we will not know your individual identity, unless you provide us with that information.

### Links

When visiting our consumer-facing applications, you may be directed, through links or hyperlinks, to other consumer applications that are not under our control and are not governed by this policy. We are not responsible for any other consumer application’s content or security or for protecting your information once you leave this consumer application. When visiting other consumer applications, you should always exercise caution and review their privacy policies

### Disclaimer

Whenever you are online or on our consumer applications, you run the risk that the information you give out will fall into the wrong hands. Although we implement and maintain commercially reasonable security procedures and practices to safeguard your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you provide to us. We accept no responsibility or liability for the activities of third parties. By using our consumer applications and applications, you agree to our Terms of Use. We reserve the right to disclose your information under limited circumstances, such as to cooperate with law enforcement or judicial authorities as required by law or legal process, to protect our own legal rights, or to protect the public good.

### Updating Information

If you would like to review the information about you that we have collected through our consumer applications, or to change that information, you can make that request by following the procedure indicated below under “Contacting Us.” We may require that you verify your identity before we process your request.

### Anti-Fraud Disclosure

Electronic communications such as email, text messages and social media messaging, may never be completely secure or confidential, particularly given the threats of fraud and threat to cybersecurity. First Weber has adopted policies and procedures to aid in avoiding fraud, but nobody can guarantee or fully prevent fraud or cybersecurity threats. Primary among our policies to prevent fraud is to advise you that First Weber and its agents will never send you any electronic communication with instructions to transfer funds or to provide nonpublic personal information, such as credit card or debit numbers or bank account and/or routing numbers.

YOU SHOULD NEVER TRANSMIT NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION, SUCH AS CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD NUMBERS OR BANK ACCOUNT OR ROUTING NUMBERS, BY EMAIL OR OTHER UNSECURED ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. EMAILS ATTEMPTING TO INDUCE FRAUDULENT WIRE TRANSFERS ARE COMMON AND MAY APPEAR TO COME FROM A TRUSTED SOURCE.

If you receive any electronic communication directing you to transfer funds or provide nonpublic personal information, EVEN IF THAT ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION APPEARS TO BE FROM Broker or its agents or affiliates, please be advised that it did not. Even if any such request you might receive may otherwise appear to be legitimate, it is likely part of a scheme to defraud you by stealing funds from you or using your identity to commit a crime. If you ever receive an email or other digital message directly, copied, or forwarded to you in any transaction, and the email requests that you send funds or provide financial or related nonpublic personal information, it did **not** come from First Weber. Do not respond to the email, but instead immediately contact First Weber, Inc. at (608) 443-2255, and please forward any suspected email fraud to [antifraud@firstweber.com](mailto:antifraud@firstweber.com).

### Updating Our Privacy Policy

We may, from time to time, change our Privacy Policy. We will notify you of any changes by posting our updated Privacy Policy on our consumer applications and inserting a new “Effective Date.”

### Contacting Us

If you would like to send us a request as indicated above, or if you have any other questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, you may contact us by e¬mail at [fwprivacypolicy@firstweber.com](mailto:fwprivacypolicy@firstweber.com) call us at (608) 443-2300.
