## How we look after and protect your personal data

       

We know how important it is that your data is stored, accessed and transferred securely. We treat all your data with extreme care and take appropriate action to ensure it is protected.

       

When you browse our website, make an order online with us or over the telephone, we use encryption technology (also known as HTTPS, TLS or SSL) to ensure that nobody else can access this data while it is in transit. This also prevents unauthorised third parties from accessing your browsing history or tampering with the web pages we send back to your computer or device.

       

We monitor our internal systems and conduct penetration testing to ensure nobody can access data that you send to us. Access to your order history is protected by your order number, and we use personal data such as your name and email address to confirm your identity.

       

Sensitive information, such as payment card information, is securely send to the relevant payment processer and not stored. This prevents us or unauthorised third parties from retrieving the original details after they have been processed.

       

Purchases in-store are made in a secure manner using a safe payment terminal and till system in line with industry standards.

         

## How long will we store your personal data?

       

Whenever we collect or process your personal data, we’ll only keep it for as long as necessary in relation to the reason it was collected. After this time, your personal data will either be completely deleted or anonymised so that it cannot be related to you individually.

       

For example, when we look at the number of pages views and visitors to our website, this will be combined statistically in a way which does not tie this to you individually but allows us to make decisions and carry out business forecasting.

       

Examples of our data retention periods:

       

         
  * For customer orders, we will store the personal data for seven years. This allows us to fulfil our contractual and legal obligations. Customer records that have not been used for seven years will also be removed from our system. After this time, we will anonymise the orders in our system.
         
  * In our internal reporting about website visitors that is linked to you personally through cookies, user identifiers or advertising identifiers is retained for a period of 26 months. After this only aggregated data will be available to us in these reports.
        
         

## Who do you share your personal data with?

       

In certain situations, it is necessary for us to share your personal data with trusted third-parties. This is necessary for us to provide our goods and services. For example, delivery companies, payment processors, technicians and service centres for repairs and warranty claims, for fraud management and to manage enquiries or complaints.

       

         
  * We share only the required information to perform the specific requirement
         
  * They may only use your data for the exact purposes specified in our agreement with them
         
  * We work closely with these third-parties to ensure your privacy is always respected

This is based on your consent provided to these companies previously. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please see the section below concerning opt-out of personalised off-site advertising.
         
  * Data analytics companies who provide insight into how website visitors find and use our website
        
       

In certain situations, we may share data with third parties for their own purposes however we will only do this in very specific circumstances.

       

         
  * With your consent, given at the time the data is supplied, we may pass data to a third party for direct marketing purposes. For example, if you choose to enter a joint competition and explicitly agree to be contacted by a third party for promotional purposes
         
  * For fraud management we may share information about activity on our website or systems. This may include sharing data about individuals with law enforcement or third party security teams such as those at your bank.
         
  * It may be necessary to disclose your personal data to police or law enforcement, regulators or government agencies. This can include within your country of origin or elsewhere, upon a valid request to do so. We will assess the privacy-impact on a case-by-case basis and considering the circumstances in detail.
         
  * Should part or all of our business be sold, expanded, reduced or transferred to a new owner or controlling party, we reserve the right to transfer relevant personal data to the new party under this privacy notice.

## How do you manage cookies set by our websites?

       

Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages, which we use to keep track of what you have in your basket, and to remember you when you return to our site.

       

Please note that cookies can't harm your computer, and they do not contain any sensitive information such as payment details, but we do use them to remember your device between visits and allow you to complete purchases on our website.

       

If you don't wish to enable cookies, you'll still be able to browse the site and use it for research purposes. Most web browsers have cookies enabled, but you can disable these in your web browser setting for certain or all websites should you need to.

       

For iOS Safari you can do this in the “Settings app” on your home screen. Select “Safari” from the menu and under “Privacy and Security” tap on the “Block Cookies” section.

       

For Chrome Mobile and some Android devices, you can do this by opening your web browser and clicking on the menu (represented by three dots). Choose “Settings” and then choose “Site settings” you can then click “All Sites” to change settings for a specific site or “Cookies” to change settings for all sites.

       

For Chrome Desktop, you can change individual site settings by browsing to the website in question and clicking the area to the left of the “address bar”. This normally shows “Secure” or our company name while visiting our website. You can then click “Cookies” and block or allow individual cookies.

       

For other devices and browsers please consult the relevant help files.

       

Please note that if you choose to block certain cookies, you may find that certain functionality will not work on our website. To use these portions of our website you may need to re-enable the relevant cookies. You can always contact us by telephone or in-store to place an order, if you prefer.

       

We do have relationships with carefully-selected and monitored suppliers who may also set cookies during your visit to be used for remarketing purposes - in other words to show you different products and services based on what you appear to be interested in. If you wish to opt-out of this personalised advertising, please see the section above this one.

       

Do not track (DNT) is a feature offered by some browsers, with some newer browsers offering it as default. If you enable it, it sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing isn't tracked, for example by third party ad or social networks, or analytic companies. You can opt out of tracking and analytics on this website by changing your settings in the Managing Cookies section on this page.

       

At present no industry-wide uniform standard has been agreed and adopted to determine how DNT requests should be managed, so our website doesn’t currently respond to DNT requests. Until that standard is established, we'll continue to review DNT and other new technologies, but won't respond to DNT requests.
