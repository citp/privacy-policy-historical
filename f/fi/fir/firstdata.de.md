**The Only Personal Information We Collect Online is Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us.**

The only information we collect about you on this web site is information that you voluntarily provide to us. This information may include, for example, name, mailing address, email address, phone number and similar information. If you supply us with personal information on this web site, we will use that information only to contact you so that we can:

**When You Browse the First Data Web Site, You Do So Without Revealing Your Identity.**

Personal information, such as your email address, is not collected unless you provide it to us. First Data does not disclose domain name or aggregate information to third parties other then vendors who assist us with our web site and who are under strict confidentiality requirements.

From time to time, however, we may disclose this information to fulfill legal or regulatory obligations or if we determine such disclosure is legally advisable or necessary to protect our rights, the rights of others, or to prevent harm.  In addition, we may aggregate data about users of our site and use it for statistical purposes.  This information helps us to better understand our site’s users and how to improve our site and our offerings.

**Use of Cookies on this Website.**

A cookie is a small file, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded on to a device such as a computer when a user accesses certain websites. Cookies allow a website to recognize a user’s device.

Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer.

**Session cookies** – allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping basket as they browse around a site. They could also be used for security or to facilitate use of webmail. These session cookies expire after a browser session so would not be stored longer term.

**Persistent cookies** – are stored on a users’ device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering users’ preferences and choices when using a site or to target advertising

**First and third party cookies** – Whether a cookie is ‘first’ or ‘third’ party refers to the website or domain placing the cookie. First party cookies in basic terms are cookies set by a website visited by the user - the website displayed in the URL window. Third party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and a separate company sets a cookie through that website this would be a third party cookie.

This website uses the following cookies. You can delete, remove your consent and/or block cookies sent to you from this website but parts of the website may not then work.
