DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION  
Why? | Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand what we do.

When you are _no longer_ our customer, we continue to share your information as described in this notice.
