<h5>Truste Certified Privacy</h5>
<p>FireHost, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("FireHost" or "we" or "us" or "our") is committed to the protection of your privacy. We have established this privacy statement (the Statement) as a means of disclosing to you how we collect, utilize, distribute and protect your personal information.

For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, "customer" shall mean any past, current or prospective customer of FireHost, including any visitor to the Site. This Privacy Statement governs the manner in which FireHost collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from customers in connection with FireHost managed hosting services and other internet services (the "Services"). </p>
      <p>FireHost, Inc. is a Licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. FireHost has elected to disclose its information practices, and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe as a testament of our commitment to your privacy. FireHost, Inc. complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>

We will respond to your request within 30 days. Please direct your questions and concerns pertaining to the Site, Service, or this Statement to us at https://www.firehost.com/about/contact.

TRUSTe will then work as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns. </p>
      <h5>The Personal Information We Collect</h5>
      <p>FireHost may collect personally identifiable information from customers in a variety of ways, including online and offline subscription and order forms, paper or telephone submissions, and other instances where customers are invited to volunteer such information. Additionally, contact information may be collected during any correspondence relating to customer support, as well as in connection with the Service offered on the Site. FireHost may collect such information as contact name, business name and type, address, phone number, email address, billing information including credit card number and expiration date as well as other information. We will only use your name, address, billing information/credit card information to process your order. The addresses are used for customer support, required notifications, product and policy updates and marketing releases. Under no circumstances will we use this information for anything else not described in this Privacy Statement. All users may at any time opt-out of our marketing by clicking the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of all marketing and customer notices.</p>
      <h5>Financial Information</h5>
      <p>Whenever customers apply for our services or sign up for any other product or service through FireHost, they may be required to submit financial information such as a credit card number and billing address before we will process the application. FireHost will not sell, share or rent any financial information collected except as disclosed in this policy or as necessary to fulfill orders.
</p>
      <h5>Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses</h5>
      <p>FireHost uses your unique network address and SessionID to help diagnose potential problems with equipment, help tailor content to match your preferred interests and to otherwise administer the Site.</p>
      <h5>Data Integrity and Security</h5>
      <p>FireHost makes diligent efforts to maintain accurate information on our customers. FireHost has put stringent security procedures in place to protect such information collected about our customers. We constantly monitor our systems, which are protected using industry-standard security measures. Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") connections are used to communicate to our system to protect customer financial information as well as encrypting vital information that customers input through the Site. Although reasonable efforts are made to secure network communications and the Site, FireHost cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure.</p>
      <h5>Data Access</h5>
      <p>Customers may access all personal identifiable information that we collect and maintain by contacting us by mail or telephone at the contact information listed below. They can correct factual errors in personally identifiable information by contacting us by mail or telephone at the contact information listed below. To protect customer privacy and security, FireHost reserves the right to take reasonable steps to verify customer identity prior to granting access or processing changes or corrections.</p>
      <h5>How Information is Used</h5>
      <p>FireHost may contact customers regarding products and services offered by FireHost and its trusted affiliates, business partners, and independent contractors. We may also use information collected through the Site for research regarding the effectiveness of the Site and related marketing, advertising and sales efforts. Information will only be made publicly available where mandated by governing agencies, in response to subpoenas or court orders or as disclosed in the terms and conditions of our agreements with customers.</p>
      <h5>Electronic Mail</h5>
      <p>Electronic communications may be sent by FireHost using customers' personal contact information to inform them of new products, important industry news or about general services and upgrades provided by FireHost. If customers do not wish to receive these industry notices, may at any time opt-out of our marketing by clicking the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of all marketing and customer notices. However, in order to fulfill our service obligations, FireHost will continue to send emails regarding customers' account administration or service interruptions for system maintenance.</p>
      <h5>Disclosure</h5>
      <p>Information collected from customers may be disclosed to independent contractors and business partners who have agreed to hold this information in confidence, not use it for any purpose except to carry out the service they are providing for FireHost, and honor our privacy and security policies in the way this information is handled.  This would include the third party agent acting as a payment processor on our behalf, as well as the third party agent hosting our chat feature. FireHost may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from customers to actual or prospective investors and partners. Should a sale of FireHost's business ever occur, collected customer information may be transferred along with the sale but the information will be treated in the same manner as set forth in this Privacy Statement. In the event of any significant changes to the manner your information is handled, we would notify you by a prominent notice on the Site, or by email.</p>
      <p>We post customer testimonials on the Site. We do obtain users' authorization prior to posting on the Site. When you select to email a friend about the Site, or Service, we request their name and email to facilitate the Service. This third party information is not used for any purposes beyond sending this one time email. We provide widgets on the Site that make it possible to share information on third party platforms. These widgets do not store your personal information.</p>
      <p>If you use a bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information that you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
      <h5>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</h5>
      <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our Site from those we actually know are under the age of 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
      <h5>Sites Other Than FireHost</h5>
      <p>The Site may contain links to third party websites. Please note that these websites' privacy and other policies may differ from those of FireHost. We strongly recommend that customers review the privacy policies of any online service prior to submitting personal information. FireHost has no control over and is not responsible for the information practices of other websites, including those to which we may link and those which may link to us.</p>

Please note that if customers enter into other contractual agreements with FireHost, privacy terms and conditions of such other agreements may supplement or supersede this policy.
