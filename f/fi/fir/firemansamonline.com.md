**USE OF TECHNOLOGY**   
USE OF COOKIES  
During the course of any visit to a HIT Entertainment Limited Web Site, the pages you see, along with something called a "cookie", are downloaded to your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. HIT Entertainment Limited cookies do not contain any PII, but they do enable us to provide features such as personalization. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser. For additional information on finding and controlling your cookies, please see the provisions at the end of this Privacy Policy entitled "HOW TO FIND AND CONTROL YOUR COOKIES." 

Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued or to block all cookies. If you set the browser to block cookies, it will result in certain personalized services not being provided to the users on that computer. 

WEB BEACONS  
Our Web Sites contain electronic images (called a "single-pixel gif" or "Web beacon") that allow us to count page views or to access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web site, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically very small, 1 by 1 pixel size, banner like files, but their presence can be easily seen within Internet Explorer by clicking on "View" and then on "Source." Our Web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor or share any personal information about visitors to our Web Sites, they are just the technique we use to compile our anonymous, aggregated statistics about web site usage. 

COMPUTER PROFILES   
We also collect and accumulate other anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For example, we accumulate visitor data relating to referring domains, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. We also record number of visits, paths taken and time spent on Web Sites and pages. None of this information is personally identifiable and we only share this information in the aggregate, reflecting overall web site or Internet usage trends.

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY**   
Children can surf our Web Sites, view content, and download materials without HIT Entertainment Limited collecting PII. To enable their participation in certain of the interactive features at our site, we may ask children to provide us with PII. For example, we may collect an e-mail address from a child for the sole purpose of responding directly to a specific online request (e.g., to send electronic postcards; to participate in a contest, sweepstakes, or competition; or to ask a question or send a comment). We also may collect a child's and a parent's online contact information in order to send the child periodic communications, such as online newsletters, site updates, or password reminders.
