We are registered with the Information Commissioner in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, Data Protection Registration no. Z4645092.

### What Information We Collect

When you place an Order or otherwise interact with the Firebox.com Website, we may ask you for certain information and you may submit personal data to Us (for example your name, phone number, postal address, email address, contact and bank / credit card details). We may also record which products you are interested in and which products you purchase as well as customer traffic patterns and site use.

Some examples of how information may be collected by us: 

  * **Information You Provide Us:** we receive and store information that you submit when using our website or that you provide us in any other way (for example by email or telephone). This information may be provided when ordering from us (via our website or by telephone); searching our website; entering competitions; accessing your account; querying order status; or by submitting text/photo/video reviews of us and our products. 
  * **Information Automatically Provided:** we receive, process and store certain information whenever you interact with our website. Like many websites, we use "cookies" (see below) and obtain certain information automatically when your Web browser accesses the Firebox.com website. Information automatically received by us includes the IP address that your computer uses to connect to the internet; your computer, browser, operating system and internet connection details; purchase history (which we may aggregate with other shoppers to form the "Firebox Top 20"); clickstream/path analysis of your journey through our website; products you searched for. We may also use software tools provided by Nielsen//NetRatings to measure and collect session information, length of visits to certain pages, repeat visits and page interaction information (such as clicks). 
  * **Email Communications:** to help us make our email newsletter more useful and interesting for our customers we attempt to receive a confirmation when you open and click on email newsletters from Firebox.com (if your email software/service supports this option). If you no longer wish to receive email newsletters, please notify us using the links provided in each newsletter. 
  * **Telephone Calls:** From time to time we monitor and record telephone calls for training purposes and to improve the quality of our service to you.
  * **Information from 3rd Parties:** we may receive information about you from other sources and add this to our account information. For example we update address information using data from third parties (including the Royal Mail "Change of Address" File), which we may use to correct our records and deliver your next catalogue to the correct updated address.

  1. Process and deliver your Order;

  5. Verify your age, in the event you are purchasing age-restricted products such as bladed items or alcohol;
  6. Open and run your Firebox customer account;
