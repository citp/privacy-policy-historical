### Cookies

In Order to improve our service we may use a device known as a 'cookie'. Cookies are a means by which information relating to your Internet activity (such as whether you have visited firebox.com before) is recorded on your hard drive and used by us to improve Firebox.com and the products and services available to you.

If you do not wish for us to use cookies when you use the Firebox.com website please adjust your Internet browser settings to not accept cookies. The Help option on the menu bar of your web browser should explain you how to do this. Please note that cookies allow you to take full advantage of the services we provide through the Firebodx.com website and so we recommend that you leave them turned on.

### 3rd Party Ad Serving

We allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.

  * **Cookies**  
Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from our website. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. We only authorise our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. 
  * **Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Serving**  
If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). 



Currently we have relationships with the following third-party ad networks (click to visit their Web site): [24/7 Real Media, Inc.](http://www.247realmedia.com/privacy.html)
