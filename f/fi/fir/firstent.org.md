# First Entertainment CU - Privacy Policy

## First Entertainment Credit Union and Media Benefits Corporation Privacy Policy

The Credit Union and our affiliate, Media Benefits Corporation, understand the importance of protecting the privacy of our members and customers. As such, we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of each member's and each customer's financial records consistent with state and federal laws. This Notice explains how we collect and share your nonpublic personal information and further describes your rights to limit the information we share about you.

## **Section I**

**Collection and Use of Information**

During the course of business, we collect nonpublic information ("information") about you from the following sources:

  1. Information that you provide to us in person, in writing or through the Internet
  2. Information obtained through your transactions and experiences with us and our affiliates
  3. Information we receive from nonaffiliated third parties about their transactions and experiences with you
  4. Information provided by consumer reporting agencies and similar companies.



We collect this information about you to complete transactions, to maintain your accounts and related records, to assist us in developing new products and services, to aid you in learning more about our products and services, and to fulfill any legal and regulatory requirements.

## Section II

**Sharing Information with Third Parties**

In the course of conducting our business, we may share any of the information we collect about you with third parties if:

  1. You request or authorize it
  2. The information is provided to help complete a transaction initiated by you
  3. The information is provided to a third party providing services to us, such as data processing, printing services, and marketing service
  4. The information is provided to a consumer reporting agency in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act
  5. The disclosure otherwise is lawfully required or permitted.



Furthermore, we may also disclose information about you to other nonaffiliated and affiliated third parties not described in this Notice as permitted by law.

We may share any of the information we collect within our affiliated family of companies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The types of companies within our family of affiliates include insurance agencies, insurance companies, mortgage bankers, broker-dealers, and financial advisors. The Credit Union also provides information to its affiliated credit union service organization, Media Benefits Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Credit Union. We may share the information you provide to us, your transaction and experience information, your credit report information, and any other information that we may collect about you, to the extent permitted by state and federal law. If you do not wish for us to share any of the information amongst our affiliates, you have the right to opt-out of such information-sharing as explained below in the section entitled "Your Right to Opt-Out."

We sometimes share the information we collect about you with outside companies that perform services for us. For example, to maintain and service your accounts or to fulfill your transaction requests, we share information with non-financial companies that provide services to us, such as data processing companies, printing companies, mailing companies, and marketing companies. Prior to sharing any information with such entities, we require them to agree to safeguard our member's and customer's information and to comply with all applicable privacy laws.

In addition, to offer you a wider array of financial products and services, we may enter into joint marketing agreements with other financial institutions such as insurance agencies, insurance companies, mortgage bankers, broker dealers, and financial advisors. We never give these financial institutions your account numbers. Prior to sharing any information with such entities, we require them to agree to safeguard our member's and customer's information and to comply with all applicable privacy laws. However, if you do not wish for us to share any of your information under these joint marketing agreements, you have the right to opt-out of such information-sharing as explained below in the section entitled "Your Right to Opt-Out."

## **Section III**

**Information Sharing in the Event of Termination of Membership**

If you decide to terminate your membership or become an inactive member, we will adhere to the privacy policies and practices as described in this Notice.

## **Section IV**

**Security of Information**

We restrict access to information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. Our employees access information about you when needed to administer your accounts, to provide requested services, or in response to a legally valid outside request or order (such as a subpoena). Our employees may also access information to exercise our rights under the law or pursuant to any agreement with you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your information. We also continually update and assess our systems to improve our technology for protecting information.
