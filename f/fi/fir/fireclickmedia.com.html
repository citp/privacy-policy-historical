  <h1>FIRECLICK MEDIA - WE RESPECT YOUR PRVACY</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Privacy Policy (Last updated: 05/01/2010)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to FireClick Media’s collection, use, storage  and disclosure of information by FireClick Media on its (a) websites,  including all its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies  (collectively, the "Website"), (b) on various third party websites, and  (c) to FireClick Media’s other information collection, including the  purchase of customer lists from third parties. FireClick Media is not  responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third  web sites or applications. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject  to  the Website Terms of Use. Your use of the Website and any personal  information you provide via the Website or through other official  FireClick Media contact remains subject to this Privacy Policy, as well as  the  Terms of Use and/or other stated policies.  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
</div>
<div class="page_mid">
  <h1>1. Collection of Information </h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>1.1 Survey Information. </h2>
  <p> FireClick Media collects information from individuals by various methods,  including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an  FireClick Media survey, order form, or a registration page either online  or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or  registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a "Survey").  (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet, including the Website,  and related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than  online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell  phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, FireClick Media or a  third party (a "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various  information to FireClick Media, which may include his or her name, email  address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone  numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and  marital status, occupation, social security number, employment  information, personal and online interests, and such other information as  may be requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information").  FireClick Media may also collect information concerning an individual  from another source and use that information in combination with  information provided from this Web Site. Completing the Surveys is  completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide  Survey Information to FireClick Media or Third Party, but an individual  may receive incentives from FireClick Media or a Third Party in exchange  for providing Survey Information to FireClick Media. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> 1.2 Third Party List Information.</h2>
  <p> FireClick Media collects information from individuals when an individual  provides information to a Third Party and FireClick Media subsequently  purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the Third  Party (the "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not  limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code,  telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date,    gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry  of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information  as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party  List Information"). When acquiring Third Party List Information,  FireClick Media seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a  right to transfer the Third Party List Information to FireClick Media and  that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the  individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> 1.3 Other Information.  </h2>
  <p>Other occasions when FireClick Media obtains information from individuals  include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to  redeem an incentive offered by FireClick Media or by a third party, (2)  when an individual requests assistance through FireClick Media customer  service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a  FireClick Media service or newsletter (together, "Other Information"). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> 1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to  associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with  information about the individual in our database. Additionally,  FireClick Media may use other new and evolving sources of information in  the future (together, "Technology Information").  (a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive  of the individual's computer that allows FireClick Media to identify the  individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in  FireClick Media’s database. You may read more about cookies at  http://cookiecentral. Individuals who use the Website need to accept  cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the  Website.  (b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to  display an image on a web page (by using a  programming  function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be  used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the  form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with  previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This  allows FireClick Media to track certain web sites an individual visits  online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an  individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for  marketing purposes. For example, FireClick Media might place, with the  consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's  website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed  in FireClick Media’s database, visits the fishing website,  FireClick Media receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe  visited the baseball site, and FireClick Media would then update Joe's  profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball.  FireClick Media may thereafter present offers of baseball related  products and services to Joe. In addition to using web beacons on web  pages, FireClick Media also uses web beacons in email messages sent to  individuals listed in FireClick Media’s database.  (c) New Technology. The use of technology on the Internet, including  cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is FireClick Media’s use  of new and evolving technology. As a result, FireClick Media strongly  encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding  its use of technology. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> 1.5 Outside Information.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media may receive information about individuals from third  parties or from other sources of information outside of FireClick Media  including information located in public databases ("Outside Information"). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> 1.6 Individual Information.  </h2>
  <p>As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third  Party List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and  Outside Information, and any other information FireClick Media gathers or  receives about individuals such as usage data, file transfer and viewing  data. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> 1.7 No Information Collected from Children.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media will never knowingly collect any personal information  about children under the age of 13. If FireClick Media obtains actual  knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under  the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our  database. Because it does not collect such information, FireClick Media  has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.  FireClick Media has designed this policy in order to comply with the  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> 1.8 Credit Card Information.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and  related information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card  Information") when an individual places an order from FireClick Media.  When the Credit Card Information is submitted to FireClick Media, such  information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.  FireClick Media will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of  processing and completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card  Information will be disclosed to third parties only as necessary to  complete the purchase transaction.  Log File Data: When users log-in to access their account, our servers will  automatically record and archive certain information that web-browsers  send whenever visiting a Website. These server logs may include  information vital to validating the user’s authorization to access the  account. Information, such as a Web request, Internet Protocol (the “IP”)  address, browser type, browser language, referring pages, exit pages and  visited URLs, platform type, click counts, pages viewed and in what order,  time spent, the date and time of the request, and other important data is  necessary to validate and authorize a user’s entry and activity on the  Website. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1> 2. Use of Individual Information.</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> 2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> <strong>THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE  PURPOSE IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.</strong></p>
  <p> The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how FireClick Media  currently uses Individual Information, but FireClick Media may change or  broaden its use at any time. As noted, FireClick Media may update this  policy from time to time. FireClick Media may use Individual Information  to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of email  advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner  advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> 2.2 Email.</h2>
  <p> FireClick Media uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers  by email to individuals. FireClick Media may maintain separate email  lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email  subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions  at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list.  To unsubscribe from all FireClick Media’s email lists, a person must send  an email to support@FireClick Media.com.  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.  In certain commercial email messages sent by FireClick Media, an  advertiser's name will appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply"  button will cause a reply email to be sent to FireClick Media. The  "Subject:" line of FireClick Media email messages will usually contain a  line provided from the advertiser to FireClick Media. </p>
    <p>2.2(b) Solicited Email.  FireClick Media only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the  Website to receive email from FireClick Media or to individuals who have  agreed on third party websites to receive email from third parties such as  FireClick Media. FireClick Media does not send unsolicited email  messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain formatting for  unsolicited email are not applicable to FireClick Media email messages. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>2.3 Targeted Advertising.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media uses Individual Information to target advertising to an  individual. When an individual is using the Internet, FireClick Media  uses Technology Information (see also Section 2.5 below) to associate an  individual with that person's Individual Information, and FireClick Media  attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person  has expressed an interest in the Surveys, indicated an interest by means  of Technology Information, and otherwise. FireClick Media may, at its  discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones,  cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional  offers. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or  indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing  using telephones and cell phones. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>2.5 Use of Technology Information.</h2>
  <p> FireClick Media uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's  Survey Information and Third Party List Information to other categories of  Individual Information to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to  track a person's online browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine  which areas of FireClick Media’s web sites are most frequently visited.  This information helps FireClick Media to better understand the online  habits of individuals so that FireClick Media can target advertising and  promotions to them. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>2.6 Profiles of Individuals.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media uses Individual Information to make a profile of an  individual. A profile can be created by combining Survey Information and  Third Party List Information with other sources of Individual Information  such as information obtained from public databases. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>2.7 Storage of Individual Information.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media stores the Individual Information in a database on  FireClick Media computers. Our computers have security measures (such as  a firewall) in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration  of the information under FireClick Media’s control. Not withstanding such  measures, FireClick Media cannot guarantee that its security measures  will prevent FireClick Media computers from being illegally accessed, and  the Individual Information on them stolen or altered. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>3. Dissemination of Individual Information. </h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties. </h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>FireClick Media MAY SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD  PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE IN FireClick Media SOLE DISCRETION.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>3.2 Order Fulfillment.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media will transfer Individual Information to third parties  when necessary to provide a product or service that a person orders from  such third party while using FireClick Media web sites or when responding  to offers provided by FireClick Media. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>3.3 Legal Process.</h2>
  <p>FireClick Media may disclose Individual Information to respond to  subpoenas, court orders, and other legal processes. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>3.4 Summary Data.  </h2>
  <p>FireClick Media may sell or transfer non-individualized information, such  as summary or aggregated anonymous information about all persons or  sub-groups of persons. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>3.5 Access.  </h2>
  <p>Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to  provide an opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete such  information. Access can be obtained by contacting  support@FireClick Media.com.com. FireClick Media may also grant advertising  clients and email services providers’ access to an individual's email  address to verify the origin of the Individual Information collected. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1>4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties. </h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.  </h2>
  <p>Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together,  "Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Website and on the Internet  generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to  collect information about individuals. FireClick Media does not control  Advertisers' use of such technology and FireClick Media has no  responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about  individuals. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Website and email messages sometimes contain hypertext links to the  web sites of third parties. FireClick Media is not responsible for the  privacy practices or the content of such other web sites. Linked web sites  may contain links to web sites maintained by third parties. Such links are  provided for your convenience and reference only. FireClick Media does  not operate or control in any respect any information, software, products  or services available on such third party web sites.
