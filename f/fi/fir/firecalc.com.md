# FIRECalc Privacy

**Your Financial Entries:** FIRECalc does not store your financial information or anything else, except as specified below.

**Supporters:** FIRECalc stores the name and email address of those supporters who choose to enter their information. This information is used solely to allow access to "bonus" features of FIRECalc, and is not used for mailing (except for lost passwords), nor given to anyone.

**Mailing List:** FIRECalc users and supporters are offered the opportunity to join a mailing list by providing their email address, and are sent FIRECalc updates and tips, and nothing else. They can opt out at any time. Their information is not shared with anyone.

**Cookies and Temporary Files** : FIRECalc uses cookies to store session information for the charting, and to enable supporter access to the bonus features. Temporary files are created on the server to allow users to create and download Excel versions of their models and view graphic results of some of the data. These temporary files are available only to the session that created them, and are automatically deleted from the server approximately 15 minutes after they are created.

**External Site Links** : FIRECalc has links to other websites on the internet. We can't control what they do.

**IP Addresses and Logging** : FIRECalc's server logs information about visitors, including IP addresses, date/time visited, referring website, length of stay, etc., as does every other web server on the Internet. This information is used for site statistics only.
