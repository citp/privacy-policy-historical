# Privacy Policy: FQF's Outline of How We Collect Information & Your Rights

This policy is applicable to firstquarterfinance.com and its associated pages. We reserve the right to change and update this policy at any time. It is your responsibility to be aware of any changes. You may also like to review our [Terms of Use](https://firstquarterfinance.com/terms-of-use/).

Note that links contained on First Quarter Finance pages may bring you to third-party websites. These sites are not maintained by First Quarter Finance; we retain no liability for the content and policies on those websites. When following a link to a third party, you may want to review its Privacy Policy and Terms of Use before using that website.

## Does First Quarter Finance collect information about me?

Yes, First Quarter Finance collects some visitor data via cookies. The information we collect helps us understand the interests of users and improve our website to optimize your experience.

Cookies are primarily used to help us display ads that are relevant to you, such as a discount on your favorite brand of running shoes or a charity you may like to support.

Cookies do not store any personal information, nor can they introduce a virus to your computer. This is unlike spyware, which sends information about your browsing history across the internet to a third party. First Quarter Finance does not use spyware.

First Quarter Finance does not sell, give, or trade the statistics we store to any third parties for the purposes of data mining, marketing, or any other reason.

We do not use browser popups, including push notifications.

Most browsers allow you to accept and/or delete cookies.
