# Rubicon Project Privacy Dashboard - The Rubicon Project

Last Updated: February 1, 2012

Our Privacy Dashboard is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website and our products and services.

Only 22% of Internet Users regularly review privacy policies for the sites they visit. That is why this Dashboard does not look like other privacy policies you may have seen. Unlike the average privacy policy which is approximately 2,500 words, the Rubicon Project offers this simple summary.

Like any summary, however, the Privacy Dashboard is not an exhaustive description of our privacy practices and should not be construed to define or limit the scope or extent of our Privacy Policies which can be found at the locations identified below.

**Rubicon Project Privacy Policy**

To read the full privacy policy governing:

Rubicon does collect non-personally identifiable information (“non-PII”) such as your IP address, domain names, referring website addresses, and some online Web browsing activity to deliver more relevant advertising.

**How We Use Data**  
Rubicon uses any non-PII collected to enable our platforms or partners to deliver targeted advertisements that we or they believe will be of most interest to you and to prepare aggregate reports that summarize activity and performance.

**Data Sharing**  
Rubicon does not share, rent, sell, or disseminate non-PII to third parties but does use this visitor information to enable our platforms or partners to deliver targeted advertisements that we or they believe will be of most interest to you.

**You are in Control!**  
Within our [Transparency and Control](http://www.rubiconproject.com/privacy/consumer-online-profile-and-opt-out/ "Consumer Online Profile and Opt-out") page, you can see the data we have stored about you as part of our Yield Optimization service, elect to discontinue further data collection by the Rubicon Project, or opt-out of targeted ads using this data. You may also use the NAI’s consumer opt-out link below to opt-out of targeted ads from the Rubicon Project and participating members where applicable [click here](http://www.rubiconproject.com/privacy/consumer-online-profile-and-opt-out/ "Consumer Online Profile and Opt-out").
