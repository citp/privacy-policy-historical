There is also statistical information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by FIDM and may be shared with other web sites within the FIDM family of web sites. This information may include: your IP address, which is a number used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data can be transmitted to you, your browser type, domain names, the time you accessed our web site, and referring web site addresses.

Use of Cookies

On occasion, FIDM’s family of web sites uses “cookies” to help personalize your online experience.  A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server to help identify the user’s computer and can be used to help FIDM recall your information on subsequent web site visits.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  In order to use certain secure areas of the site, cookies must be enabled.

We will use this information to respond to your e-mail.  FIDM may also use your personal information to inform you of other products or FIDM events.

We also use your information to help operate the FIDM family of web sites.  For example, to help us improve our web site and to ensure that we make every effort to provide you with information and offers that are of interest to you, we may merge your personally identifiable information with click-stream data and other data we have (including offline data). We may also develop a non-identifiable profile on you based on the pages within our site that you visit.

Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

We only share your personally identifiable information (such as your e-mail address) with select third parties including our agents and advertisers.  These companies are prohibited from using that information for any purpose other than the limited stated purpose for which FIDM has hired them.
