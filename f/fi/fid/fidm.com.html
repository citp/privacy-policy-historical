              <p dir="ltr">FIDM is committed to providing a safe learning working environment for students and employees that is free of all forms of discrimination, harassment, exploitation, or intimidation. Sexual misconduct is a form of discrimination. All members of the college community should be aware that the college strongly opposes harassment and sexual misconduct and such behavior is prohibited by federal and state law and college policy. This policy applies to all FIDM community members, including students, faculty, administrators, staff, and third parties conducting business or having any official capacity with the college or on college property. FIDM is prepared to take prompt action to prevent and correct such behavior of individuals who engage in sexual harassment, as well as any other unlawful harassment based on factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or age. Violation of this harassment and sexual misconduct policy will not be tolerated and corrective action up to and including disqualification or termination may be taken. We encourage all students to report these incidents. FIDM is committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals involved in a report of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and sexual violence. Throughout the process of investigation of a report of harassment and sexual misconduct, every effort will be made to protect the privacy interests of all individuals, and respect and safeguard private information, to the extent possible consistent with the legal obligations of FIDM to investigate and respond effectively. Retaliation against a person who properly reports, complains about, or participates in the investigation of such harassment is strictly prohibited.</p>

<p dir="ltr">FIDM’s harassment and sexual misconduct policy and procedures are available in full on the FIDM Portal (under College Policies FAQs). Reports of sexual misconduct and inquiries concerning FIDM’s policy may be directed to the Title IX Coordinator at 619.235.2049 x1830.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><u><strong>Affirmative Consent</strong></u><br>
In alignment with California statute, FIDM’s policy concerning sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, includes an affirmative consent standard in the determination of whether consent was given by both parties to sexual activity.&nbsp; “Affirmative consent” means affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the responsibility of each person involved in the sexual activity to ensure that he or she has the affirmative consent of the other or others to engage in the sexual activity.&nbsp; Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent.&nbsp; Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and can be revoked at any time.&nbsp; The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent.</p>
