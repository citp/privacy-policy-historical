# FIPLAB - Privacy Policy

## Our Privacy Policy

FIPLAB Ltd is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we collect and/or ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website or our applications and services, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement. By using our website, applications and/or services, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this policy.

FIPLAB Ltd may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy is effective from 20th April 2018.

#### What we collect

We may collect the following information:

  * name (if you provide it to us)
  * contact email address (if you provide it to us)
  * IP address, browser type and version, time/date of your visit, time spend on our web pages and other diagnostic data
  * other information relevant to our applications such as aggregate anonymous usage statistics (i.e. total daily users of an app)
  * data you provide in the use of our applications in order for us to facilitate a specific feature (e.g. cloud syncing)



#### What we do with the information we gather

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

  * Internal record keeping, such as a database of customers and respective valid application license keys
  * Improving our applications and services
  * Sending emails about our applications using the email address which you have explicitly provided
  * Providing customer support
  * Website and application anonymous usage/traffic monitoring - e.g. what version of the app is being run, if it has crashed due to a bug etc
  * Application specific features such as user accounts for data syncing etc
  * We may disclose the data to trusted service providers whom we rely on for hosting, marketing and analytics solutions. In all such cases, we will ensure the service provider agrees to keep the data confidential. This is quite standard with all companies, so there is no cause for concern. For example, we have to store the data you provide to us to make the MiniNote Pro cloud syncing service possible with hosting companies, such as Amazon Cloud. This is required for the cloud syncing to function. Also, if you provide us with your email address, then we'll hold your contact details with our mailing list provider, MailChimp. We will hold your app purchase/order information with Paddle (our app licensing and payment processor).



#### Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

#### Payments

We offer paid products and services. In such cases, we use third-party services for payment processing.

We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.
