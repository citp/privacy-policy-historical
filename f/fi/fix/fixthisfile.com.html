			<p>Additionally, FixThisFile.com gathers general information about visits to our Web site and stores this information in log files. This information is stored in anonymous profiles and is not associated with a user's account.

			<h2>Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
		
			<p>FixThisFile.com is committed to protecting your privacy. FixThisFile.com will not, under any circumstances, share, rent or sell your Personal Information nor does FixThisFile.com trade or exchange mailing lists with any other organization. Furthermore, FixThisFile.com only shares your Personal Information with our contractors that assist us in our efforts to fulfill our obligations to you, and then only with partners that commit to adhere to the same level of commitment as FixThisFile.com to protect your privacy and data. We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders containing a physical medium, such as backup CDs. This company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
			<p>FixThisFile.com maintains this information; but we reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website. If you choose to use our chat forum and require assistance, and would like someone to follow-up with you, then you will be asked to provide an email address. The email address is stored in "chat logs" by a third party, but is not utilized in any way by them and remains our information.</p>
		
			<h2>FixThisFile.com Affiliates</h2>
			<p>FixThisFile.com may share some or all of your Personal Information with a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "affiliates"), in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
			<h2>How We Communicate with You</h2>
		
			<p>FixThisFile.com has an optional e-mail service for customers who wish to periodically receive promotional information, such as general product, service and FixThisFile.com news. Users can sign up for emails through one of the following processes: (1) an online Purchase; (2) registering through the full application;  (3) registering through the trial application; and (4) signing up on the FixThisFile.com website.</p>
			<p>Customers are provided the option to opt-out within each e-mail. If you no longer wish to receive FixThisFile.com communications, you may "unsubscribe" from our mailing program at any time in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>By clicking on the auto-unsubscribe link included in each e-mail</li>
				<li>By contacting our technical support using this <a href="/contact.php">contact form</a></li>
		
			</ul>
			<p>We will then update our database and take reasonable measures so that no further promotional correspondence should be sent to the e-mail address. You may, however, still receive transactional messages.</p>
			
			<h2>Surveys and Contests</h2>
			<p>From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>
			<p>We use this information to monitor site traffic and personalize the site, and to notify contest winners and award prizes.</p>
			<p>We may continue to use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>
		
			<h2>Transactional Messages</h2>
			<p>FixThisFile.com sends required notifications via e-mail to keep you informed of the status of your orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices. This service is used for messages that are important for the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality of our services. When you purchase or register a product online, we require an e-mail address for completion of the transaction, which we will use for these communications. In order to stop receiving these notifications, please contact our technical support team using our <a href="/contact.php">contact form</a>. You will be opted out of further communications within 10 business days.</p>
			
			<h2>Ways to Update Your Personal Information</h2>

			<h2>FixThisFile.com's Commitment to Data Security</h2>
		
			<p>FixThisFile.com has security measures in place, such as the following, to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your Personal Information in our customer database. Personal Information provided to FixThisFile.com is stored in secure facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only. We have put in place a series of access-control procedures required for retrieval of personal information. The FixThisFile.com Web site is regularly tested for security breaches to protect against unauthorized viewing of Personal Information.</p>
			<p>To provide secure credit card processing when ordering, orders placed on our Web site are processed through a payment gateway which operates under its own privacy policy.</p>
			<p>FixThisFile.com DOES NOT store credit card information. FixThisFile.com does not handle financial transactions via the Web, so it has no need for streaming encryption products. FixThisFile.com works with a third party to serve as a trusted intermediary to handle e-commerce transactions with our customers. Our commerce partner handles e-commerce on a secure server which encrypts all of our customers' personal information. To learn more about how our commerce partners manages the privacy of information in conjunction with these e-commerce transactions, please see their complete Privacy Statement. If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may <a href="/contact.php">contact</a> a support representative.</p>
			<p>Although we make good faith efforts to store the Personal Information we collect in a secure operating environment that is not accessible to unauthorized users, we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
			
			<h2>Acceptance of this Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>By using the Web site or any services provided through the Web site, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
			<h2>Privacy Policy Revisions and Notifications</h2>
			<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
			<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, and by means of a prominent notice on our home page, posted 30 calendar days prior to implementing the change.</p>
