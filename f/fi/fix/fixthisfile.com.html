            <h3>Why ReviverSoft Collects Personal Information</h3>
            <p>ReviverSoft only collects your Personal Information where it is required to provide you the best
                services and products available. By maintaining an accurate customer database,
                we are able to send notifications via e-mail to keep you informed about the status
                of your orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices.
                These messages are essential to the maintenance of your subscription and the functionality
                of our products and services.
            </p>
            <h3>What Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
                ReviverSoft collects your Personal Information at a variety of points,
                including when you place an order, (which may require you to provide personal information,
                including a credit card number, to our commerce provider Cleverbridge), register software,
                request services or take part in other activities on our Web site. For example,
                we often ask for your Personal Information when you are conferring with one of our customer
                support technicians, downloading a new product or program update, registering your
                software or purchasing a product. During these interactions we will collect Personal
                Information relevant to your transacting with ReviverSoft, such as your name,
                mailing address, e-mail address, shipping address and credit card information along with
                information about the ReviverSoft products you own, such as the activation code or key code,
                date of purchase and information relating to a support issue. We use this information for
                billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order,
                we will use this information to contact you. When you register, you will be provided with
                an option to opt-out of receiving promotional information on our products and services.
                We will not use your personal information for anything other than what you have intended it for.
                Please be aware that if you prefer not to provide us with your Personal Information,
                because such information may be necessary for us to provide certain services,
                we may not be able to, or may choose not to, make such services available to you.
            <br><br>
                ReviverSoft also assigns a unique identifier (UID) that is created using information
                about the hardware that is exclusive to each computer. The UID contains no personally
                identifiable information and is used solely for verification purposes to provide product
                updates, verify compliance to licensing terms, prevent fraud and prevent piracy.
                Apart from the registration key, version details and application settings no other
                information is transmitted. The UID is never distributed or shared and cannot be reverse
                engineered by a third-party.
            </p>
            <h3>Regarding Children</h3>
            <p>
                ReviverSoft does not intentionally gather Personal Information
                about visitors who are under the age of 13.
            </p>
            <h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                Following common e-commerce practices, ReviverSoft uses "cookies" and other technologies to
                collect non-personal data that enables us to better understand and improve the usability,
                performance and effectiveness of ReviverSoft's Web site, and for reporting purposes to track sales.
                Cookies are unique text files sent to your browser and stored on your computer.
                We do not store any personal information with these cookies. Use of these third party
                cookies by our tracking utility company or service providers is not governed by
                this Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.
            <br><br>
                If you do not want ReviverSoft to send cookies to your browser, you can set your browser options
                to reject cookies or notify you when a Web site tries to put a cookie in your browser software.
                Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use some of our Web site services.
            <br><br>
                Additionally, ReviverSoft gathers general information about visits to our Web site and stores
                this information in log files. This information is stored in anonymous profiles and is
                not associated with a user's account. This information includes the number of total
                visits to our Web site, and which browser is used to view our Web site (including the
                version number). No Personal Information is contained in this data. Our current
                partners help us to track our website usage. No personally identifiable
                information is collected. ReviverSoft uses this information to understand
                traffic and downloads on our Web site, enabling us to improve the site,
                provide the best online experience possible and improve our ability to serve our customers.
            <br><br>
                We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by
                recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the
                effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
            </p>
            <h3>Sharing Your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
                ReviverSoft is committed to protecting your privacy. ReviverSoft will not,
                under any circumstances, share, rent or sell your Personal Information in
                ways other than as outlined in this privacy policy nor does ReviverSoft trade
                or exchange mailing lists with any other organization. Furthermore,
                ReviverSoft only shares your Personal Information with our contractors
                that assist us in our efforts to fulfill our obligations to you, and then
                only with partners that commit to adhere to the same level of commitment
                as ReviverSoft to protect your privacy and data. We use an outside shipping
                company to fulfill orders containing a physical medium, such as backup CDs,
                a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services,
                an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf and a customer support
                provider to supply live chat. These companies do not retain, share,
                store or use personal information for any other purposes.
            <br><br>
                ReviverSoft maintains this information; but we reserve the right to disclose
                your Personal Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure
                is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding,
                court order, or legal process served on our Website. If you choose to use our
                chat forum and require assistance, and would like someone to follow-up with you,
                then you will be asked to provide an email address. The email address is stored in
                "chat logs" by a third party, but is not utilized in any way by them and remains
                our information.
            <br><br>
                If our company or our assets are acquired by another company,
                that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and it
                will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information
                as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h3>How We Communicate with You</h3>
            <p>
                ReviverSoft has an optional e-mail service for customers who wish
                to periodically receive promotional information, such as general product,
                service and ReviverSoft news. Users can sign up for emails through one of
                the following processes: (1) an online Purchase; (2) registering through
                the full application; (3) registering through the trial application;
                and (4) signing up on the ReviverSoft website.
            <br><br>
                Customers are provided the option to opt-out within each e-mail.
                If you no longer wish to receive ReviverSoft communications, you may
                "unsubscribe" from our mailing program at any time in the following ways:
            <br><br>
                </p><ul class="privacy">
                    <li><span>By clicking on the auto-unsubscribe link included in each e-mail</span></li>
                    <li><span>By contacting our technical support department at support@reviversoft.com</span></li>
                    <li><span>By visiting <a class="blue" href="http://www.reviversoft.com/unsubscribe">our unsubscribe page</a> and completing the form.</span></li>
                </ul>
            <br><br>
                We will then update our database and take reasonable measures so that no further
                promotional correspondence should be sent to the e-mail address. You may, however,
                still receive transactional messages.
            <p></p>
            <h3>Transactional Messages</h3>
            <p>
                ReviverSoft sends required notifications via e-mail to keep you informed of the status
                of your orders or accounts and to provide updates and technical notices.
                This service is used for messages that are important for the maintenance
                of your subscription and the functionality of our services.
                When you purchase or register a product online, we require an e-mail address for
                completion of the transaction, which we will use for these communications.
                In order to stop receiving these notifications, please contact our technical
                support team at support@reviversoft.com. You will be opted out of further communications
                within 10 business days.
            </p>
            <h3>Ways to Update Your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
                ReviverSoft carefully maintains our customer database in an effort to keep your Personal
                Information accurate for the purposes for which it is used.
                It is your right to be able to update your Personal Information as needed.
                You can correct out-of-date information, update information, remove information,
                delete your Personal Information or review any information previously provided to
                ReviverSoft by visiting www.revisersoft.com/myaccount/ or by contacting our support
                department at support@reviversoft.com. Changes will be implemented within 10 business days.
            <br><br>
                Please note, however, that we may retain certain information relating to software
                licensing and your information may also be retained in our archives and use your
                information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes,
                and enforce our agreements. When contacting customer service, we will verify your
                identification through the use of security questions before sharing any Personal
                Information as it appears in our customer database.
            </p>
            <h3>ReviverSoft's Commitment to Data Security</h3>
            <p>
                ReviverSoft has security measures in place, such as the following,
                to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your Personal Information
                in our customer database. Personal Information provided to ReviverSoft is stored
                in secure facilities with access restricted to authorized personnel only.
                We have put in place a series of access-control procedures required for retrieval
                of personal information. The ReviverSoft Web site is regularly tested for security
                breaches to protect against unauthorized viewing of Personal Information.
            <br><br>
                To provide secure credit card processing when ordering, orders placed on our
                Web site are processed through a payment gateway which operates under its own privacy policy.
            <br><br>
                ReviverSoft DOES NOT store credit card information. ReviverSoft does not handle financial
                transactions via the Web, so it has no need for streaming encryption products.
                ReviverSoft works with a third party to serve as a trusted intermediary to handle
                e-commerce transactions with our customers. Our commerce partner handles e-commerce
                on a secure server which encrypts all of our customers' personal information.
                To learn more about how our commerce partners manages the privacy of information
                in conjunction with these e-commerce transactions, please see their complete
                Privacy Policy located on our co-branded purchase pages. If at any time you would
                like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online,
                you may contact a support representative at sales@reviversoft.com
            </p>
