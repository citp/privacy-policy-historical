When you purchase, download trial or evaluation versions, or register RegCure software, we may collect personal information including your name, address, email address, etc. for the purpose of recording the transaction when you engage in activities on our web site or within the RegCure software.

We will never sell, rent, lease, or give your information to a third party unless required so by law.

We may also disclose or use your personal information when we, in good faith, believe that the applicable law may require us to do so.
