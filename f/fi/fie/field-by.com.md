We continue to adhere to good business practices. We will regularly review our policies and practices as we believe is warranted. Changes that are made that affect our Privacy Policy will be posted to our website.

  


#### Protection of Personal Information

We have taken precautions to protect your personal information under our control from misuse, loss or alteration. Our security measures include industry standard technology and equipment to help protect your data. Unfortunately, however, no system can ensure complete security and you should take all necessary steps to protect your information and its transmission to us. Since the Internet is a public medium, we cannot guarantee the absolute protection of your personal information.

  


#### What We Provide to Third-Parties

Authorized third-party agents may need access to some of your personal information. In such cases, we only provide authorized third-party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested service or transaction. We may also provide your information to our affiliated companies and successors.

We also reserve the right to provide authorized third-parties with aggregate statistics about our clients, traffic patterns, and related site information. This data may reflect site usage patterns and other information.

  


#### Public Author Page Information Sharing

FiledBy has entered into agreements with selected third parties such as Ingram Content Group and Copa (DMC Worldwide)(out "Authorized Content Distribution Partners"). Under these agreements, FiledBy receives and shares publicly available author, publication and similar information. The intent of these relationships is to help authors registered at FiledBy to market themselves and their work more broadly on the Internet. By posting or correcting information about works that you have created or about yourself on a publicly available author page on www.filedby.com, you agree that we may allow our Authorized Content Distribution Partners to access, use and display such information for the purpose of additional author promotion and to improve the accuracy of author information.

FiledBy also serves publicly available author information to other Authored Content Distribution Partners, such as Copia, a website that promotes authors and sells books and ebooks.
