I. Privacy Policy of SAP Fieldglass. We respect the privacy of our customers and are committed
to treating customer information responsibly. Accordingly, we adhere to the following:

     that to the extent you are a registered user of the SAP Fieldglass application, your personal

II. The Information We Collect. We rely on many sources of information to help us understand

desk support services for the SAP Fieldglass application. We carefully stipulate under these agreements
                                                      © 2016 SAP Fieldglass. All rights reserved. Proprietary and Confidential.


that these vendors may view personal information about you, and that they must protect this
information and may not use it for any other purpose other than in connection with our agreement and

      contact details, information about your working history and relevant records checks).
•     Information we receive from our customers and other third party users of our application. For
      example, we collect information relating to individuals' job applications from the entities who use
      the SAP Fieldglass application (for example, companies and their consulting and recruitment
      agencies). The SAP Fieldglass application is used by companies to manage their workforces.
      Companies may ask that their agencies also use the application so that these entities can exchange
      information relating to job candidates between one another. SAP Fieldglass collects this personal
      information by virtue of hosting the application. The information SAP Fieldglass collects may
      include sensitive information, such as personal data your employer has deemed relevant for
      employment-related or record keeping purposes,) where you provide that information to us or to
      the entities that use the SAP Fieldglass application.
•     Information about you if you are an individual who is, or who is employed by, one of our suppliers,

III. Why Do We Collect Information? SAP Fieldglass collects the personal information it needs to
provide services and information to its customers, for its business operations and to comply with the
law. Depending on the circumstances, SAP Fieldglass may also use personal information about you to:
•      Accurately identify you;
                                                      © 2016 SAP Fieldglass. All rights reserved. Proprietary and Confidential.

IV. How Do We Collect Your Information? SAP Fieldglass collects information related to you in
several ways:
•    Some personal information is gathered when you register. The more information you volunteer (and
     the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience.
•    In addition to the above, we may also ask you for personal information at other times, including (but
     not limited to) when you enroll in a program offered by one of our partners, when you alter your
     request for services (i.e., increase your annual spend) and when you report a problem with our
     software or one of our services. If you contact SAP Fieldglass we may keep a record of that
     correspondence. SAP Fieldglass may also occasionally ask you to complete surveys that we use for
     research purposes.
•    As noted above, we may also collect your information from third party users of the SAP Fieldglass
     application. For example, we collect information relating to individuals' job applications from
     entities that use the SAP Fieldglass application.
V. How is the Collected Information Used?
•    We also monitor usage to help us develop upgrades to the software and develop the design and
     layout of the website.
•    We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality
     changes and special offers we think you’ll find valuable.
                                                       © 2016 SAP Fieldglass. All rights reserved. Proprietary and Confidential.


•   SAP Fieldglass collects, stores and uses information from the users of its application (meaning the
    computer software programs), and the hosted environment (meaning a hardware/software system
    combination under the control of SAP Fieldglass on which the Product, or any portion thereof, is
    run). Aggregated versions of this information (information that does not personally identify you)
    may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns,
    with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance the application or hosted
    environment and our services. Additionally, SAP Fieldglass may keep track of this information and
    the information that you provide to us for our internal review, business development, research,
    press inquiries or aggregate statistical analysis, customization, demographic patterns, and historical
    trends. Aggregate information may occasionally be shared with our business partners and
    customers, and this information does not include any personally identifiable information about you
    or allow anyone to identify you individually. As SAP Fieldglass adopts additional technology we may
    also gather information through other means.
VI. Disclosing Personal Information. For the purposes described in this policy, we may disclose
personal information:
•   to any of our related companies;
•   to our suppliers, contractors and service providers, professional advisers, dealers and agents;

    investigation and resolution of disputes or complaints concerning use of our services;
•   to anyone to whom our assets or business (or any part of it) is transferred or offered to be
    transferred;
•   where you have otherwise consented; or
•   as otherwise required or authorized by law.
We disclose personal information to recipients outside of the United States, the United Kingdom and
Australia. Such recipients are likely to be located in the jurisdictions in which we have corporate offices –
for example, our main headquarters are located in the United States, with related companies located in
the United Kingdom and Australia. We take reasonable steps to ensure the persons and organizations to
whom we disclose personal information are bound to protect the privacy of that personal information in
accordance with applicable law.
VII. Information Security. We restrict access to personal information about you to those who
need to have that information to provide products or services to you. If we use other companies to
provide products or services to you, we require that they keep the information we share with them safe
and secure. We have physical, logical and procedural safeguards in place that comply with legal
requirements to store and secure information about you from unauthorized access, alteration and
                                                       © 2016 SAP Fieldglass. All rights reserved. Proprietary and Confidential.

application.

of this information, including any sensitive information, by SAP Fieldglass. If we decide to change our
privacy policy, we will post those changes in this document so that you are always aware of what
