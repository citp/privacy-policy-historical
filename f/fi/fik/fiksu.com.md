Last modified: September 20, 2016

GDMService Inc. d/b/a Fiksu (“Fiksu”) is a marketing service company focusing on the mobile application marketplace. We are committed to maintaining the privacy of your information when you visit our website, and when we provide products that optimize the mobile marketplace inclusive of ads and app download environments, on behalf of our mobile application provider clients (“Clients”). This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the personal information received about you on this website, [www.fiksu.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20170131021018id_/https://fiksu.com/privacy-policy/www.fiksu.com) (our “Website”), and when providing marketing services to our application publisher Clients (our “Services”). Information on our EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks is available at [www.fiksu.com/privacy-shield-policy](http://www.fiksu.com/privacy-shield-policy).

**Fiksu Website**

When you use certain features of our Website, we may collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your email address and mobile phone number. We automatically collect non-personally identifiable information such as IP addresses and website usage information from you when you visit our Website. Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Fiksu.

We may disclose and use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce our [Terms of Service](https://www.fiksu.com/terms-of-use) (for example, when necessary to protect our or a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights), or to alert you to changes in our policies or agreements that may affect your use of our Website. We may also disclose personally identifiable information when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in the Website, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.

**Fiksu Application Marketing Service**

Fiksu buys mobile advertising space on behalf of our Clients which are generally mobile application providers and companies looking to advertise via mobile applications. When you click on a Client ad or application link delivered by Fiksu, Fiksu servers receive and store a mobile identifier (“Mobile ID”) which is a pseudonymous number that is associated with your mobile device. Fiksu cannot use the Mobile ID to identify you personally, but it does enable us to deliver relevant advertising to each mobile device. In addition to the Mobile ID, we collect information about the kind of mobile device you use (e.g., iPhone, Samsung), the operating system for your mobile device (e.g., Android, Apple O/S), IP address, the applications you download from Fiksu Clients, when, how, and how often you use those applications.

We use your device’s Mobile ID and other information about Client applications you download to help our clients understand which ads are most effective at generating downloads of our Client’s applications. We also use your Mobile ID and the information associated with your device Mobile ID over time (e.g., the applications you download, when and how you use those applications, and any publisher-provided demographic data) to enhance our services and to select Fiksu Client ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.

Fiksu may use agents and contractors in order to provide our services to Clients. If such agents and contractors have access to your Mobile ID and/or the information associated with your Mobile ID, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Fiksu.

**Information Sharing, Onward Transfer**

We disclose the information in our systems, including your Mobile ID and/or the information associated with your Mobile ID over time for the following purposes:

  * To Fiksu Clients when you click on their ad and/or download their application;
  * In response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena);
  * When we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.
  * In other circumstances when necessary either to protect the rights or property of Fiksu, Fiksu Clients, and third parties.
  * We may transfer information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If Fiksu is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.
