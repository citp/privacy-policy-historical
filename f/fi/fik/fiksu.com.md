# Privacy Policy | Fiksu

Last modified: April 7, 2011

Fiksu, Inc. (Fiksu) is committed to maintaining the privacy of your personal information when you visit our website, download and use Fiksu™ applications such as Fluent News™ Reader, and when we provide products that optimize the mobile marketplace inclusive of ads and app download environments, on behalf of our mobile application provider clients ("Clients"). This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the personal information received about you on this website, in connection with our Fluent News application, and when providing marketing services to application publishers.

**Links to Other Content  
**We frequently make content or services from other websites available to you from links located on our websites or within our applications. These other websites are not subject to this Privacy Policy, and Fiksu has no control over how such websites may use the personal information collected on those sites. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such website to determine how that site protects your privacy.

**Fiksu Websites and Applications  
**When you use certain features of our website and applications, we may collect personally identifiable information from you that may include your email address and mobile phone number.

We automatically collect IP addresses, website usage and application usage information from you when you visit our website or use our applications. When you use Fiksu applications, we may also collect your "unique device ID" or "UDID," which is a number uniquely associated with your mobile device. Fiksu cannot use the UDID to identify you personally, this information helps us evaluate how our visitors use our websites and applications, and permits us to enhance those sites and applications.

We may use the information collected about you in the following ways:

  * For the purposes for which you specifically provided the information including, for example, to send email/SMS alerts that you have requested.
  * To provide advertisers and other third parties with aggregate information about our user base and its usage patterns.
  * To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics or preferences.



We may combine the information that we collect from you from Fiksu websites and applications with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of our other products, services and websites.

We use third-party network advertisers, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These network advertisers may be supplied with or have access to your personally identifiable information solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.

Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your personally identifiable information outside of Fiksu, Inc.

We may disclose and use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce our Terms of Service (for example, when necessary to protect our or a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights), or to alert you to changes in our policies or agreements that may affect your use of our application and websites. We may also disclose personally identifiable information when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in the application or website, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.

**Fiksu Application Marketing  
**Fiksu buys mobile advertising space on behalf of certain mobile application providers (Clients). When you click on a Client ad or application link delivered by Fiksu, Fiksu servers receive and store the "unique device ID" or "UDID," which is a number uniquely associated with your mobile device. Fiksu cannot use the UDID to identify you personally, but it does enable us to collect information about the kind of mobile device you use, the operating system for your mobile device, the applications you download from Fiksu Clients, when, how, and how often you use those applications.

We use your UDID and information about Client applications you download to report on the number of unique users who click through Fiksu Client ads, and the number of those users who download Fiksu Client applications as a result of those ads.

We also use your UDID and the information associated with your UDID over time (e.g., the applications you download, when and how you use those applications, and any publisher-provided demographic data) to enhance our services and to select Fiksu Client ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.

Fiksu may use agents and contractors in order to provide our services to Clients. If such agents and contractors have access to your UDID and/or the information associated with your UDID, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Fiksu. We disclose your UDID and/or the information associated with your UDID over time for the following purposes only:

  * To Fiksu Clients when you click on their ad and/or download their application;
  * In response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena);
  * When we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary or appropriate, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets in the application or website, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.
  * In other circumstances when necessary either to protect the rights or property of Fiksu, Fiksu Clients, and third parties.
