<h1>PHEENIX'S PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span>
This Privacy Policy outlines the type of information collected and used by Pheenix, Inc. and any associated registrars ("Pheenix") in connection with its website, products, and services ("Services"). PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES.
</span></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li><span><b>Introduction<br></b>
<u>Scope.</u> Pheenix is committed to respecting privacy rights and has published this Privacy Policy to show its commitment to fair information practices. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to information collected through
Pheenix's website at <pheenix.com> and other communications between you and Pheenix; it does not apply to any information collected by Pheenix on other websites or through other means or to any websites or services of third parties ("Third-Party Websites"), which may have materially different policies.
<br>
<u>Terms.</u> By using the Services, you warrant that you have read and understood, and agree to be bound by, Pheenix's separate <a href="https://www.pheenix.com/backorders3/tos.php">Terms of Service</a> and any other applicable agreements.
<br>
<u>No Permission Without Agreement.</u> By using the Services, you warrant that you have read and understood, and agree to the terms of, this Privacy Policy. If you do not understand or agree to this Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using the Services.
</pheenix.com></span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><span><b>Updates and Changes to Privacy Policy<br></b>
Each time you access Pheenix's website, the then-current version of this Privacy Policy will apply. We recommend that you periodically check the date of the Privacy Policy
and review any changes. Pheenix reserves the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, update, or change this Privacy Policy simply by posting a new version on this
page. Any such addition, update, or change will be effective immediately upon posting. Unless Pheenix obtains your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will only apply
to information collected after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy and not to information collected earlier.
</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left:.25in"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><span><b>Information Collection Practices<br></b>
<u>Services.</u> Pheenix may collect your information in connection with the Services, including when you register for the Services, place an order, report a problem, request more information, or communicate with Pheenix. When you register to use the Services, Pheenix may ask for your personal and billing information to process transactions you request. Pheenix may also collect information for users leaving comments on Pheenix's blogs or as part of surveys.
<br>
<u>Traffic Data.</u> Like most website operators, Pheenix gathers information that web browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) Internet domain names; (iii) types of devices accessing Pheenix's website; and (iv) types of web browsers accessing the website, which is anonymous information that is not meant to personally identify you.
<br>
<u>Cookie Policy.</u> "Cookies" are text files placed on your computer by websites you visit or certain emails you open. Cookies store a string of information on a user's computer or mobile device, which the user's web browser provides to the website automatically each time it interacts with the website. The purpose of Cookies is to identify the user as a unique user of the website. Pheenix uses two types of Cookies: "first-party Cookies" and "third-party Cookies."
<br>
<u>First-Party Cookies.</u> Pheenix uses first-party Cookies for the following purposes: (i) to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing the Services to your interests; and (ii) to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the Services. If you do not wish to have first-party Cookies placed on your computer or mobile device, you should set your web browser to refuse Cookies before accessing the Services. However, certain features of the Services may not function properly without the aid of Cookies. If you refuse Cookies, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
<br>
<u>Third-Party Cookies and Advertising.</u> Pheenix may advertise on other Third-Party Websites to you after you use the Services. Pheenix and third-party marketing partners, including Google, Inc., may use first-party Cookies (such as the Google Analytics Cookie), third-party Cookies (such as the DoubleClick Cookie), and web beacons (such as the Facebook conversion tracking pixel, https://www.facebook.com/business/a/online-sales/conversion-tracking), including across multiple devices, to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to you based on your use of the Services. This practice is commonly known as retargeting or remarketing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_retargeting). Google Analytics is Google's analytical tool that helps website and app owners understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of Cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. Any of these third parties may place Cookies on your computer or mobile device, use web beacons (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon), and gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data to deliver relevant metrics and content. You may customize your Google Cookies preferences or opt out of using Google Cookies on the Google Ads Settings page at http://www.google.com/settings/ads. You may learn about Facebook Cookies and how to customize your preferences at https://www.facebook.com/about/ads. You may opt out of using other third-parties' Cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. You can learn more about how to delete or control Cookies at http://www.aboutCookies.org/.
<br>
<u>Personally Identifiable Information.</u> To use certain features of the Services, you may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). Personal Information includes the following categories, without limitation: (i) "Contact Data" (such as your name, phone number, fax number, mailing address, and email address); (ii) "Financial Data" (such as your credit/debit card number and expiration date); (iii) "Demographic Data" (such as your gender and ZIP code); and (iv) "Third-Party Social Media Account Data" (such as your account information for third-party social media accounts). Pheenix gathers your Personal Information when you provide it through the Services. Pheenix may supplement the Personal Information you provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or third parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide that information to Pheenix. You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, but your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain features of the Services.

<br>
