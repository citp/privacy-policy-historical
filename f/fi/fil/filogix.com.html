                A majority of the personal information that we collect is received from third parties
                such as credit bureaus and mortgage brokers. We rely on these organizations to obtain
                consent directly from the individuals and we do not use or disclose the information
                that these third parties provide us except as required in providing our services.

                Whenever Filogix collects personal information, we always disclose the purposes
                for which we are collecting the information, the manner in which we plan to use
                the information and the entities to whom the information will be disclosed. We also
                obtain individuals' consent for our collection for these purposes. If we choose
                to use personal information already in our custody for a purpose which was not identified
                at the time we initially collected the information, unless the new purpose is required
                by law, we will seek the consent of the affected individuals before using this information
                for these purposes.

            <br>
            <div>
                We do not collect personal information that is not necessary for the purposes we
                identify when we collect it. We will not refuse to provide a service to an individual
                if they choose not to provide us with their personal information, unless their failure
                to provide such information makes us unable to provide such service.

                only as long as necessary to fulfill our identified purposes. Personal information
                that is no longer required for statutory or regulatory requirements or to fulfill
                the purposes we identified when we collected the information is destroyed, erased
                or rendered anonymous to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the

                Any individual may inquire about the personal information that Filogix has in its

                Typically, personal information provided to Filogix will not be routinely updated.
