You can rest assured that FilesAnywhere is committed to safeguarding your data and personal information. Below describes how we collect, use, and handle your personal information when you use our services.

### **Collection and Use of Personal Information**

**FilesAnywhere Services** : When sending files and messages through our services, we ask for your email address, as well as that of the recipient, in order to complete your request. We maintain this information on our servers in order for you to use.  We will never send promotional emails to, or disclose recipient email addresses, without your permission.

**Contests and Promotions** : Please be advised that if you request information, sign up for an optional service, submit feedback, or enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so that we may contact you. We may also use the collected information to notify you about important changes regarding our service functionality or related news that you may find useful.

It's important that you ensure the accuracy of your profile information, including a valid email address so that we may contact you in regard to official changes in our privacy policies should they occur.

**Device Information:** We collect information from and about the devices you use to access our service. This includes IP addresses, the type of browser, the device you use, and identifiers associated with your devices.

**Cookies** : Small pieces of data stored in temporary hard drive files by your browser are called cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies and FilesAnywhere’s website login requires the use of cookies. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide special features, such as default login, and to store temporary session data between visits.

### **Information Protection**

**Personal Information** : FilesAnywhere uses state-of-the-art security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of any personal information that we collect and store. Our Infrastructure team scans the system nightly testing for vulnerabilities. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access at our SOC II and III certified data center. Our facility is located in Carrollton, Texas and provides multiple security levels and solid reliability.

**Files and Data** : FilesAnywhere stores all data on an encrypted enterprise grade storage system.  You may also opt to use SSL login for fully encrypted communications with our servers. The use of SSL technology ensures that all data transmitted between the web server and browser remains encrypted.  Additionally, on Professional accounts, your account is password protected with the option for MFA as an added layer of security.

**FilesAnywhere Employees** : FilesAnywhere is devoted to keeping the content of your files private and secure. Only a few dedicated network technicians on duty at the data center have access to the secure files storage system. Technicians are not permitted to access customer documents unless required by law, and are bound by confidentiality agreements for your protection.

### **Information Disclosure to Outside Parties**

**Statistics** : Though FilesAnywhere monitors customer traffic patterns and site usage for development of the user interface, along with collecting statistics for performance measurement, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information, including your email address, to any outside party.

**Surveys** : At any time, FilesAnywhere may conduct customer satisfaction surveys for internal use, and only for the benefit of our users. Surveys are only conducted by FilesAnywhere employees.
