### FilesAnywhere Makes Your Privacy a Top Priority

In today's online environment, we understand how important it is to protect our customer's privacy. You can rest assured that FilesAnywhere is committed to safeguarding your data and personal information.

### Information Protection

**Personal Information** : FilesAnywhere uses state-of-the-art security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of any personal information that is within our control.

Our world-class facility located in the heart of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex was built from the ground up and optimized for Internet service providers. Our data center building provides ironclad security and solid reliability using the same standards as hospitals, banks, and telecommunications industries.

**Files and Data** : FilesAnywhere stores all data on a highly secure system, and you may also opt to use secure server software (SSL) login for fully encrypted communications with our server. The SSL encrypts all information before it is sent to us, so no on can intercept your important documents on the Internet. Additionally, your account is strictly password protected. As long as your password is kept secret, you have full control of the files in your account.

**FilesAnywhere Employees** : FilesAnywhere is devoted to keeping the content of your files private and secure.
