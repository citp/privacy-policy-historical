# FileMaker Inc.

Protecting your privacy is important to FileMaker. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. 

**Collection of Personal Information  
**In order to give you superior customer service, FileMaker collects your personal information in several ways. For example, FileMaker may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form when you make a purchase or request service, register to attend a seminar, participate in an online survey, register a new FileMaker product, or ask to be included in an email mailing list. In addition, when ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number. FileMaker collects and stores the information you provide in a secure database. 

**How Your Personal Information is Used  
**FileMaker uses your personal information for several purposes including: 

  * To ensure our site is relevant to your needs. 
  * To deliver services, such as newsletters, events, training or software, that you request or purchase. 
  * To help us create and publish content most relevant to you.
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from FileMaker. 
  * To allow you access to limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate. 



**When We Disclose Personal Information  
**Because FileMaker is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other FileMaker business affiliates around the world. They will protect your personal information in accordance with the FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy. FileMaker may occasionally share your personal contact information with carefully selected companies, to keep you informed about related products and services. If you do not want to receive promotional information from FileMaker or other companies and wish to opt-out, visit the [FileMaker Communications Web Page](https://web.archive.org/company/opt_out.html). 

FileMaker works with other companies that help us provide FileMaker products and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal information in accordance with FileMaker's policies. 

FileMaker may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or legal process. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of FileMaker employees, users of FileMaker products or services, or members of the public. 

**How We Protect your Personal Information  
**FileMaker is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, the FileMaker Store uses industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from the FileMaker Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator 6 – 7.x or Internet Explorer 5 – 6.x. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. 

**Access to Your Personal Information/Opt-Out Choices**  
You have access to the information we have about you. To review and update your personal information, contact [FileMaker Customer Assistance](https://web.archive.org/web/20030626194020id_/http%3A//filemaker.com/company/contact.html#customerassistance). 

If you receive communications about FileMaker-related products and services and wish to opt-out, visit the FileMaker Communications Web Page at [http://www.filemaker.com/company/opt_out.html](https://web.archive.org/company/opt_out.html), send an e-mail to remove@filemaker.com with the word REMOVE, or call our Customer Assistance department at toll-free (800) 325-2747.

**Collecting Other Personal Information**  
When you browse FileMaker’s website, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we don’t collect personal information when you browse — not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using. 

Like many websites, the FileMaker website uses “cookie” technology. When you first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better. 

In some of our email to you, we use a “click-through URL.” When you click one of these URLs, you may pass through our web server before arriving at the website that is your destination. We may track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. 

**Clear Gifs and Log Files**  
FileMaker employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable information.

FileMaker also uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Public Forums**  
This site makes forums and news groups available to its users. Please remember that some information that is disclosed in these areas may become public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Our Companywide Commitment to Privacy**   
To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every FileMaker employee. In addition, FileMaker participates in industry initiatives to preserve privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects of electronic commerce. 

FileMaker does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information. 

FileMaker's website contains links to other sites. FileMaker does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies. 

If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner. 

The FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.
