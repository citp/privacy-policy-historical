RealNetworks does not use your personal information for purposes incompatible with those listed above. RealNetworks does not sell, rent, or share your personal information to a third party unless you consent to provide such information to a third party partner or content service.

In some cases, access to certain products and services, such as content subscription products or products distributed by third parties, may require the provision of personal information to a third party, such as a content provider or distributor. In such cases, this will be stated during the registration process, in the terms of use, through the distribution process, or in a similar manner. The third party’s use of such information is governed by that party’s privacy policy, and RealNetworks’ use is governed by this privacy policy. Please visit the privacy policy of the content partner to make sure you understand how they use the personal information you provide to them. If you do not wish for such a transfer to take place, you should not register for the applicable product or service. Additionally, RealNetworks may be required to provide specific access and usage information to certain content providers and rights holders as a condition of content licensing and royalties. In such cases, RealNetworks may provide content usage, access, demographic and other information without your personally identifiable information (your name, billing information, email address) to the content provider.

RealNetworks may disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors (e.g. a customer service contractor or a credit card clearing service) in order for them to provide specific services for RealNetworks, and to better serve our customers. RealNetworks’ contractors are bound by strict contractual requirements to keep all personal information they process strictly confidential and to use such information solely on behalf of RealNetworks.

Also, RealNetworks may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on RealNetworks; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of RealNetworks and its products; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of RealNetworks products or the public at large.

Obligatory or Optional Nature of the Requested Information
