<h3>3. How We Use Personal Information</h3>

The Personal Information that you submit to us remains your property, but by
submitting such information to us you grant us the right, subject to applicable
state and federal law, to use the Personal Information (other than Sensitive
Information) for marketing purposes. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise
distribute any and all Personal Information (other than Sensitive Information)
with/to any third-party for any and all uses permitted by this Privacy Policy
and applicable law. These third parties may include, but shall not be limited
to: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including
lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail
marketers; (c) telemarketers (where and to the extent permitted by applicable
law); (d) SMS text-based marketers (where and to the extent permitted by
applicable law); and (e) direct marketers.  We
may also use your Personal Information for any Services-related purpose, and/or
marketing and survey purpose, on our own behalf and on behalf of our affiliates
and subsidiaries. We may disclose Personal Information to third-party agents
and independent contractors that help us create and/or operate promotions and
surveys. You agree that we may contact you at any time with updates and/or any
other information that we may deem appropriate for you to receive in connection
with your continued use of the Site. We are able
to offer the Services to you, in part, based on your willingness to be reached
by our third-party advertisers. Your Personal Information (other than Sensitive
Information) will be shared with advertisers on an aggregate and non-aggregate
basis. We also use contact information from your Personal Information to send
you information about the Services, our other offerings and to keep you
informed of our other products and services that may be of interest to you and
to contact you about your billing account status. Please keep in mind, though,
that we do not control, and are not responsible for, the practices of our
third-party advertisers. If you wish to stop receiving future communications
from us and/or third party advertisers, or if you wish to prevent the transfer
and/or sale of your Personal Information to third parties (subject to
restrictions contained in applicable state and federal law), please see the
Removal of Your Information/Opting Out section below. By
submitting your Facebook account ID at the Site, you agree to grant us access
to your Facebook profile for the sole and exclusive purpose of delivering
Member Content URLs (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) to your Facebook
profile. By submitting your Personal Information at the Site, you agree
to receive e-mail marketing from us and our third-party advertisers. In
addition, where you submit a telephone number at the Site, if ever, you agree
that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for
purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310
et seq. (the "ATSR"). With respect to the ATSR, and
notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade
Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing
in accordance with the terms of the ATSR. In
addition, where you submit a mobile telephone number at the Site, if ever, you
agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, SMS
text-message based marketing, from us and our third party advertisers and
marketers (where, and to the extent that, such marketing is permitted by
applicable law). As such, notwithstanding that your mobile telephone number may
be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right
to contact you via SMS text-message based marketing in accordance with
applicable state and federal law. Further, you agree that we reserve the right
to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute your mobile telephone
and other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and all non-marketing
uses permitted by this Privacy Policy and applicable law. We
reserve the right to release current or past Personal Information: (i) in the
event that we believe that the Site and/or the Services is/are being or has/have
been used in violation of this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions or to
commit unlawful acts; (ii) if the information is subpoenaed or otherwise
requested pursuant to a valid legal proceeding; or (iii) if we are sold or
acquired. Moreover, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or
communication to any third-party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the
disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail
address with third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the
CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time. Users should also be aware
that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority
under certain circumstances to permit Personal Information to be shared or
transferred to third parties without permission. If
you enroll in certain Member programs, we may use your Personal Information to
send you a welcome email that may confirm your user name and password. In
addition, we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about Services
and other products, services, information and news that may be of interest to
you, and provide you with targeted feedback. In addition, if you identify
yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use
such information (including Personal Information) to respond to your questions
or comments, and we may file your questions or comments for future reference. We may also supplement the information that we
collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and
improving the Site and Services, and to determine your preferences so that we
can tailor the Site and Services to your needs.

<h3>4. Your IP Address</h3>

Each time that you visit the Site, our web server automatically recognizes your IP
address and the web page from which you came. Your IP address is used to help
identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also use
your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the
Site and to better serve you in using the products, services and other features
associated with the Site.

<h3>5. Cookies and Action Tags</h3>

Cookies:
The first time that a user provides an e-mail address in connection with
his/her activities at the Site, we assign an identification number to that
e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the applicable user's PC. Whenever that
user comes back to the Site using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to
identify the user and to recall the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a
user provides other information in connection with his/her activities on the
Site (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), we may store that
information, along with the user's e-mail address, in our user database. We may
use the information stored in our database: (a) to effectuate the purpose or
transaction for which the information was originally provided by a user; (b) to
pre-populate information fields in the event that the subject user wishes to
purchase products and/or services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services,
promotions or other offers in the future; (c) to ensure that a user will not be
repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while
visiting the Site; and/or (d) to, in connection with regular communication with
a user, include offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or
are likely to be, of interest to that user. We also use cookies to anonymously
track and target the interests of our users to further enhance the experience
on the Site. To find out more about cookies, please visit
www.cookiecentral.com. To disable and reject cookies, Click Here Action Tags: An action tag or a web-beacon (also
known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or
actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other information on the
Site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used
to transparently collect information. We may use action tags to count the
number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the
pages of the Site and to provide information about what products/services are
viewed or purchased. We reserve the right to retain cookie and action tag data
indefinitely. At no time will we share cookie-related, action-tag-related
and/or generated information and/or data with third parties.

<h3>6. How We Use Demographic Information and Aggregate Data</h3>

We use demographic information to tailor the Site and/or Services to the interests
of our users. Demographic information is shared with third party advertisers so
that they can tailor their advertisements to the appropriate audience. Demographic
information may also be shared with other third parties. We
reserve the right to provide aggregate or group data about our users for lawful
purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics,
usage or characteristics of our participants as a group, without disclosing
personally identifiable information. By becoming a Member, you agree to allow
us to provide such aggregate data to third parties. By agreeing to the terms of
this Privacy Policy, you hereby consent to the disclosure of any record or
communication to any third party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the
disclosure to be appropriate.

<h3>7. Our Security Precautions</h3>

We endeavor to safeguard and protect our users' information. The privacy of your
Personal Information is very important to us. The servers that we store personally
identifiable information in are kept in a secure physical environment. We have
security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of
Personal Information under our control. When our registration/application
process asks users to enter Sensitive Information, and when we store and
transmit such Sensitive Information, that information is encrypted and
protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect
Sensitive Information online, we also do everything in our power to protect all
user information off-line and online. Unfortunately, no data transmission over
the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security
of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. However, access to your information is strictly
limited, and not accessible to the public. All of our users' information is
restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a
specific job are granted access to Personal Information. Our employees are
dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information.
Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action.
In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any
applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information
security breach with respect to your Personal Information. Please be advised
that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement,
determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.

<h3>8. Minors</h3>

No information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Site by visitors under
eighteen (18) years of age. Persons under eighteen (18) years of age are not
permitted to access the Site and we do not knowingly collect Personal
Information from such individuals. We encourage parents and guardians to spend
time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive
activities of their children.

<h3>9. Removal of Your Information/Opting Out</h3>

</script> However, deleting your
Personal Information, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from
us or third parties, will only change or delete the data in our database for
purposes of transacting future business on the Site and for managing future
communications from us and third parties. These deletions will not change or
delete Personal Information already collected as part of a particular
transaction in our database, which may have already been shared with third
parties, all as provided above in this Privacy Policy. You will need to contact
third parties who may contact you directly to change your preferences or your
Personal Information that they may be using to contact you.
