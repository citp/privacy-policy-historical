* Terms and conditions 

Filmaffinity reserves the right to edit or delete any user data that may be considered inappropriate or obsolete without previous notification. Any indice of inappropriate use of the website, or tampering thereof will result in the subsequent deletion of suspicious accounts. 

In order to ensure the reliability, transparency, impartiality and objectivity of the data available on our website, Filmaffinity reserves the right to delete any ratings belonging to newly registered users having less than 6 months’ activity on the website, less than 10 logins, or less than 200 rated films. Special attention will be paid to new film releases in each country, as well as recently awarded movies, current nominees, or new films with few ratings that are thus susceptible of tampering. 

Additionally, Filmaffinity remains committed to improving existing automatic controls, such as filters, automatic and manually controlled corrective measures, as well as tampering detection systems for movie ratings. 

At Filmaffinity, we would like to underline and stress our commitment to reliability, transparency, impartiality, and objectivity regarding all information currently stored in the Filmaffinity database. Our commitment strikes us as particularly important in the following areas: 

Average ratings on all movie and TV series. User movie ratings. Selected excerpts and reviews from relevant media. Trending media & professional reviews.
