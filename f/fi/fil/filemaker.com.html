<h1>FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy</h1>
<p> Protecting your privacy is important to FileMaker. We strive to keep your 
  personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand 
  the FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. 
  Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your 
  personal information. </p>
<p><b>Why We Collect Personal Information<br>
  </b>FileMaker collects and uses your personal information to give you superior 
  customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and 
  services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your 
  personal information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, 
  software updates, special offers, and other information we think you'd like 
  to hear about. This may occasionally include information from other companies 
  about products and services that can add value to your FileMaker products. From 
  time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate 
  in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and 
  develop better products. </p>
<p><b>How We Collect Personal Information<br>
  </b>We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might 
  ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make 
  a purchase or request service, register to attend a seminar, or participate 
  in an online survey. In addition, when you register a new FileMaker product, 
  sign up for FileMaker services, or ask to be included in an email mailing list, 
  we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database. </p>
<p><b>When We Disclose Personal Information<br>
  </b>Because FileMaker is a global company, your personal information may be 
  shared with other FileMaker business units around the world. They will protect 
  your personal information in accordance with the FileMaker Customer Privacy 
  Policy. FileMaker may occasionally share your personal contact information with 
  carefully selected companies, to keep you informed about related products and 
  services. If you do not want to receive promotional information from FileMaker 
  or these companies, contact <a href="../company/contact.html#customerassistance">FileMaker 
  Customer Assistance</a> to update your personal contact preferences. </p>
<p>FileMaker works with other companies that help us provide FileMaker products 
  and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. 
  For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver 
  your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and 
  delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal 
  information in accordance with FileMaker's policies. </p>
<p>At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal 
  information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure 
  is necessary for the public interest. </p>
<p><b>How We Protect your Personal Information<br>
  </b>FileMaker safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, 
  electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution 
  to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords 
  often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure 
  browser. </p>
<p>The FileMaker Store uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption 
  on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases from 
  the FileMaker Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator 
  4.0 or later, or Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. This protects the confidentiality 
  of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the 
  Internet. </p>
<p><b>Access to Your Personal Information </b><br>
  You have access to the information we have about you. To review and update your 
  personal information, contact <a href="../company/contact.html#customerassistance">FileMaker 
  Customer Assistance</a>. </p>
<p><b>Collecting Other Personal Information </b><br>
  When you browse FileMaker's website, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, 
  we don't collect personal information when you browse -- not even your email 
  address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer 
  and operating system you are using. </p>
<p>Like many websites, the FileMaker website uses "cookie" technology. When you 
  first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique, 
  random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about 
  you, except perhaps your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. 
  Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, 
  where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies 
  to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better. </p>
<p>In some of our email to you, we use a "click-through URL." When you click one 
  of these URLs, you may pass through our web server before arriving at the website 
  that is your destination. We may track click-throughs to help us determine your 
  interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer 
  communications. </p>
<p><b>Our Companywide Commitment to Privacy</b> <br>
  To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate 
  these privacy guidelines to every FileMaker employee. In addition, FileMaker 
  participates in industry initiatives to preserve privacy rights on the Internet 
  and in all aspects of electronic commerce. </p>
<p>FileMaker does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or 
  send them requests for personal information. </p>
<p>FileMaker's website contains links to other sites. FileMaker does not share 
  your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their 
  privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those 
  companies. </p>
<p>If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated 
  at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most 
  recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate 
  with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information 
  in a new manner. </p>
<p>The FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We 
  encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes. </p>
