      Inc., (“FileMaker”) is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. 
      TRUSTe is an independent, nonprofit organization whose mission is to build 
      users’ trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of 
      fair information practices. Because FileMaker wants to demonstrate our commitment 
      to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information privacy practices 
      for compliance review by TRUSTe.</p>
    <p> The TRUSTe trustmark reflects our promise to tell you what personal information 
      we collect; the types of companies we may share your information with; the 
      choices available to you regarding the collection, use, and distribution 
      of the information; the security procedures in place to protect the loss 
      or misuse of information under our control; and how you can correct inaccuracies 
      in the information. </p>
    <p> If you have questions or concerns about FileMaker’s collection, 
      use, or disclosure of your personal information, please email us at privacy@filemaker.com. 
      If FileMaker doesn’t respond or your inquiry hasn’t been addressed 
      to your satisfaction, please visit the <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_new.php" target="_blank">TRUSTe 
      website</a> for contact information. This certification applies to all sites 
      under the filemaker.com domain. However, any communications to TRUSTe must 
      be in English. </p>
    <p>Disclaimer: The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected 
      through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected 
      through software downloaded from the site.</p>
  </div>
  <p> Protecting your privacy is important to FileMaker. We strive to keep your 
    personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand 
    the FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. 
    Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your 
    personal information. </p>
  <p><b>Collection of Personal Information<br>
    </b>In order to give you superior customer service, FileMaker collects your 
    personal information in several ways. For example, FileMaker may ask you to 
    provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an 
    online form when you make a purchase or request service, register to attend 
    a seminar, participate in an online survey, register a new FileMaker product, 
    or ask to be included in an email mailing list. In addition, when ordering 
    products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card 
    number. FileMaker collects and stores the information you provide in a secure 
    database. </p>
  <p><b>How Your Personal Information is Used<br>
    </b>FileMaker uses your personal information for several purposes including: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To ensure our site is relevant to your needs. </li>
    <li>To deliver services, such as newsletters, events, training or software, 
      that you request or purchase. </li>
    <li>To help us create and publish content most relevant to you.</li>
    <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information 
      and other new services from FileMaker. </li>
    <li>To allow you access to limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate. 
    </li>
    
  </ul>
  <p><b>When We Disclose Personal Information<br>
    </b>Because FileMaker is a global company, your personal information may be 
    shared with other FileMaker business affiliates around the world. They will 
    protect your personal information in accordance with the FileMaker Customer 
    Privacy Policy. FileMaker may occasionally share your personal contact information 
    with carefully selected companies, to keep you informed about related products 
    and services. If you do not want to receive promotional information from FileMaker 
    or other companies and wish to opt-out, visit the <a href="/company/opt_out.html">FileMaker 
    Communications Web Page</a>. </p>
  <p>FileMaker works with other companies that help us provide FileMaker products 
    and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these 
    companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they 
    can deliver your products efficiently. The information they receive is for 
    shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard 
    your personal information in accordance with FileMaker's policies. </p>
  <p>FileMaker may disclose your personal information if required to do so by 
    law or legal process. We may also disclose information about you if we believe 
    that disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of FileMaker employees, 
    users of FileMaker products or services, or members of the public. </p>
  <p><b>How We Protect your Personal Information<br>
    </b>FileMaker is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. 
    We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your 
    personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, 
    the FileMaker Store uses industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption 
    on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases 
    from the FileMaker Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape 
    Navigator 6 – 7.x or Internet Explorer 5 – 6.x. This protects 
    the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it 
    is transmitted over the Internet.</p>
  <p>We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you 
    are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters 
    and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. </p>
  <p><b>Access to Your Personal Information/Opt-Out Choices </b><br>
    You have access to the information we have about you. To review and update 
    your personal information, contact <a href="../company/contact.html#customerassistance">FileMaker 
    Customer Assistance</a>. </p>
  <p>If you receive communications about FileMaker-related products and services 
    and wish to opt-out, visit the FileMaker Communications Web Page at <a href="/company/opt_out.html">http://www.filemaker.com/company/opt_out.html</a>, 
    send an e-mail to remove@filemaker.com with the word REMOVE, or call our Customer 
    Assistance department at toll-free (800) 325-2747.</p>
  <p><b>Collecting Other Personal Information </b><br>
    When you browse FileMaker’s website, you are able to do so anonymously. 
    Generally, we don’t collect personal information when you browse — 
    not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell 
    us the type of computer and operating system you are using. <br>
    <br>
    Like many websites, the FileMaker website uses “cookie” technology. 
    When you first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with 
    a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information 
    about you. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the 
    most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. 
    We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site 
    even better. <br>
    <br>
    In some of our email to you, we use a “click-through URL.” When 
    you click one of these URLs, you may pass through our web server before arriving 
    at the website that is your destination. We may track click-throughs to help 
    us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness 
    of our customer communications. </p>
  <p><strong>Clear Gifs and Log Files</strong><br>
    FileMaker employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web 
    Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what 
    content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, 
    similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements 
    of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible 
    on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end 
    of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable 
    information.</p>
  <p>FileMaker also uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, 
    track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for 
    aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p><strong>Public Forums</strong><br>
    This site makes forums and news groups available to its users. Please remember 
    that some information that is disclosed in these areas may become public information 
    and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Our Companywide Commitment to Privacy</b> <br>
    To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate 
    these privacy guidelines to every FileMaker employee. In addition, FileMaker 
    participates in industry initiatives to preserve privacy rights on the Internet 
    and in all aspects of electronic commerce. <br>
    <br>
    FileMaker does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or 
    send them requests for personal information. <br>
    <br>
    FileMaker's website contains links to other sites. FileMaker does not share 
    your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their 
    privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of 
    those companies. <br>
    <br>
    If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated 
    at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the 
    most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate 
    with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information 
    in a new manner. <br>
    <br>
    The FileMaker Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We 
    encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes. </p>
