<h3>4. Data Protection Act</h3>
We have notified the Data Protection Commissioner under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998 ("the Act") that we may obtain information about data subjects.<br>
<br>
<h3>5. Information Gathered by Us</h3>
<ol>
	<li>5.1 You will appreciate that we need to gather some personal information from you when you wish to buy our products or services. The full details of the information we need is set out on the registration form. You can volunteer some of the information we ask, but you are obliged to fill in all the boxes marked with an asterisk if you wish to register with and/or purchase from us.</li>

	<li>5.4 We also collect demographic and profile data on our website. This information may be combined with other forms of information to permit us to bring together, in aggregate form, information about the people who use our site. Such information will enable us to understand, in general terms, user preferences in relation to the content of the website and the effectiveness of advertising ( for example, advertisers may find it useful if you can inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day)</li>
</ol>
<br>
