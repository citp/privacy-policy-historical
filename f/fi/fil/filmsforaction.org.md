# About Films For Action - Privacy Policy

**What information do we collect?**

We collect information from you when you register on our site, subscribe to our newsletter, make a donation, add comments on site content, or edit your profile information. 

When registering on our site, you will be asked to enter your first and last name and your e-mail address. We strongly encourage our site members to use their real name, so that your friends can find you on the site and to help cut down on many of the problems associated with anonymity on the web. We understand in some cases the necessity of maintaining anonymity (such as if the user writes articles on controvertial topics that might jepordize their job or real-word reputation). In these situations and at your discretion, you may visit our site anonymously. However, if it appears someone is abusing this privelege simply to be a jerk or to be disruptive, we won't be as sympathetic to these problems than if you used your real name.

After registering, you may add further details to your profile including your birthday, location, political views, website, about me description, profile picture, and other information tailored to help foster real-word connections with others of like interest. **
