# GAMEFRONT MEDIA PRIVACY POLICY | GameFront

Last Updated: April 10, 2009

GameFront (together with its direct and indirect parent and subsidiary entities, “GameFront”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the ways that personally identifiable and anonymous information about our online users, event registrants and print subscribers is gathered, our information sharing practices, and how online users and print subscribers may request changes to the way this information is shared.

**Personally Identifiable Information We Collect**

We collect personally identifiable information when you provide it to us, such as when you subscribe to our magazines (either directly with us or through another company such as a subscription agency), sign up for email newsletters, enter a contest, register for site membership or an online event, participate in surveys, attend face to face events, or otherwise communicate with us. Several of the services that we offer, including but not limited to file downloads, message boards, webcasts and online trade shows, require registration as a condition of use; when you register with or sign into one of our sites you are no longer anonymous. We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.

**Information You Volunteer and How It Is Displayed to Others Online**

GameFront is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the course of discussions in our forums, chat rooms, or other forms of publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose to make public in your member profile.

**What We Provide to Third Parties**

**Statistical Reports and Analysis**

Naturally, the aggregate statistics that describe our print and online audience, which is often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites, help us sell advertising and otherwise publicize GameFront and its brands.  
**  
Email and Postal Mail Deployment, Data Analysis and Other Data Services**

In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, you may opt-out of the GameFront newsletter.

**GameFront Magazines, Seminars, Events, Sites and Other Publications and Services**

As a GameFront customer, you can also expect to receive relevant email notices of events and other services. From time to time we are also able to secure and offer to our customers specially-negotiated discounts and new products from leading companies.

**Change of Ownership of GameFront Properties**

The mailing list(s) associated with GameFront properties may also be subject to transfer to another company in the event of a change of ownership (as was the case on April 1, 2009 when we bought the assets of GameFront from Ziff Davis Media).

**Anonymous Information We Collect  
**  
**Cookies**

As you probably know, cookies are small pieces of information that many Web sites store on your computer’s hard drive when you visit them. They don’t tell us who you are unless you’ve specifically given us personally identifiable information. Cookies stored on your hard drive by a GameFront site are not accessible to other sites.

Like many other web sites, GameFront sites use cookies to improve your experience with our online content. For example, we may use a cookie to identify members so they don’t have to re-enter a user ID and password when they wish to download a utility or post to a discussion. As another example, cookies can be used to control the number of times you see advertisements, like pop-ups. By allowing us to better understand how users interact with the site over time, cookies also help us improve your experience and deliver more relevant content to you. Cookies may be created directly by our sites for these purposes, or by third-party companies operating on our behalf.

Some of our advertisers and content providers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers and content providers. You need not have cookies turned on to visit our sites, though cookies may be required in order for you to participate in certain areas. If you choose to become a member of the GameFront web sites, you must have cookies enabled to access any member related pages. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis.  
**  
Pixel Tags**

Like many web sites, GameFront may also use pixel tags, also known as clear gifs, beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies for the same purpose. You can disable pixel tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most advertisements.

**Online Ad Serving**

GameFront uses numerous third-party advertising service companies to serve advertisements when you visit our site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other personally identifiable information you’ve provided us) about your visits to our and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. For this purpose, these companies may monitor our sites using cookies and pixel tags for the purpose of reporting web site traffic, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on our sites. The information collected through the use of these pixel tags is not personally identifiable.

Some of our advertisers use third-party companies to serve their advertisements on our sites and, in some cases, in our HTML-formatted newsletters. Often, these third-party advertising companies employ cookie and pixel tag technologies to measure the effectiveness of Web and e-mail advertisements. We do not give any personally identifiable information to them as part of this relationship. Use of their tracking technology is subject to their own privacy policies. For more information about the privacy policies of the third-party advertising providers including information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, click here.

**Contests and Sweepstakes**

GameFront periodically conduct contests. If you choose to enter, the data you provide will be subject to the official rules of the specific contest, as well as this Privacy Policy. Data collected during the registration for such contests may be shared with sponsors. Please read the contest rules carefully before you submit your data.

**Co-Branded Sites and Services**

When you use a co-branded service within our network of sites, or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that service or site partner. Use of your information by such partners is subject to their applicable privacy policies.

**White Papers and Other Sponsored Downloads**

GameFront hosts sponsored product listings and offers informational downloads for a variety of companies (or Sponsors). When registration is required in order to receive or view the download, all data collected during product registration and/or GameFront Web site registration will be shared with the Sponsor. When shared, this data is governed by the individual Sponsor’s privacy policy (except as noted in the following sentence) and may be used by the Sponsor for follow-up purposes. Similarly, GameFront will have the same access to this data as the Sponsors, and this Privacy Policy continues to govern how GameFront uses the data. For details on how Sponsors use the information you provide, please contact the Sponsor directly.  
**  
Changing Your Privacy Options**

**Update Your Registration Information**

You can correct or change the information collected during site registration at any time at the profile page links shown above by sending email to the addresses shown above. It may take a brief period of time for any corrections or changes to be publicly displayed or implemented throughout our systems.

**Security**

We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information you disclose to our magazines and websites secure and to only release this information to third parties we believe share our commitment to privacy. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for the actions of these parties.

**Children**

GameFront web sites are not intended for use by children, especially those under 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums, and chats. Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited from making purchases, including subscriptions, on our sites.

If your children disclose information about themselves in our public discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so.  
**  
Compliance with Law**

Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to release information concerning any user of our sites or services when we have grounds to believe that the user is in violation of our Terms of Service (http://www.gamefront.com/tos/) or other published guidelines or engages in (or we have grounds to believe is engaging in) any illegal activity, and to release information in response to court and governmental orders, other enforceable requests from government entities, civil subpoenas, discovery requests and otherwise as required by law. We also may release information about users when we believe in good faith that such release is required to protect the rights, property, safety or security of GameFront, any of our users or the public, or to respond to an emergency.  
**  
Changes to the GameFront Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time. If there is a significant change, we will indicate on our sites that our Privacy Policy has changed.
