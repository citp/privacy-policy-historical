<p>By providing us with your data, you warrant to us that you are over 13 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>Filmstro Limited</strong> is the data controller and we are responsible for your personal data (referred to as “we”, “us” or “our” in this privacy notice).</p>
<h4>Contact Details</h4>
<p>Our full details are:</p>

We should be grateful if you would contact us first if you do have a complaint so that we can try to resolve it for you.</p>
<p>It is very important that the information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. Please let us know if at any time your personal information changes by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@filmstro.com">support</a>.</p>
<h3>2. WHAT DATA DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h3>

<h4>Marketing communications</h4>
<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us; or</li>
<li>if you provided us with your details and ticked the box at the point of entry of your details for us to send you marketing communications; and</li>
<li>in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you OR by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@filmstro.com">support</a> at any time.</p>
<p>Where you opt out of receiving our marketing communications, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>
<h4>Change of purpose</h4>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to find out more about how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@filmstro.com">support</a>.</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose for which we collected the data, we will notify you and we will explain the legal ground of processing.</p>
<p>We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<h3>5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services.</li>
<li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom and other relevant jurisdictions who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Marketing agencies such as, Atom42 based inside the EU.</li>
<li>Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<h3>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h3>
<p>Countries outside of the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>Some of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
<p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:support@filmstro.com">support</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
<h3>7. DATA SECURITY</h3>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<h3>8. DATA RETENTION</h3>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<h3>9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h3>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
<li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
<li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
<li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
<li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
<li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
<li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see more about these rights at:</p>
<p><a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/">https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/</a></p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@filmstro.com">support</a>.</p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>

<h1 id="cookie-policy">COOKIE POLICY</h1>
<h3>What's a cookie?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A "cookie" is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive and which records how you move your way around a website so that, when you revisit that website, it can present tailored options based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes.</li>
<li>Cookies are used by nearly all websites and do not harm your system.</li>
<li>If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be altered within your browser settings. You can block cookies at any time by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do we use cookies?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We use cookies to track your use of our website. This enables us to understand how you use the site and track any patterns with regards how you are using our website. This helps us to develop and improve our website as well as products and / or services in response to what you might need or want.</li>
<li>Cookies are either:
<ul>
<li>Session cookies: these are only stored on your computer during your web session and are automatically deleted when you close your browser – they usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page but they do not collect any personal data from your computer; or</li>
<li>Persistent cookies: a persistent cookie is stored as a file on your computer and it remains there when you close your web browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you visit that website again. (We use persistent cookies for Google Analytics.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cookies can also be categorised as follows:
<ul>
<li>Strictly necessary cookies: These cookies are essential to enable you to use the website effectively, such as when buying a product and / or service, and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the services available to you on our website cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.</li>
<li>Performance cookies: These cookies enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our website. For example, they allow us to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the site are most popular.</li>
<li>Functionality cookies: These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please note that third parties who advertise on our website (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.</li>
