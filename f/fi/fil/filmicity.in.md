_**Privacy Policy**_

Thank you for visiting FilmiCity.in. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this statement explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site.

**We want you to**

  * feel comfortable using our web sites
  * contact us with your questions or concerns about privacy on this site
  * know that by using our sites you are consenting to the collection of certain data



WHAT INFORMATION IS, OR MAY BE, COLLECTED FROM YOU?   
Your IP address is logged when you post and is available to the administrator of the Cbox (Chat box). For your convenience, your name and selected URL will be stored in a "cookie" on your computer so that they are filled in automatically when you return to this Cbox.

Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.

We make chat rooms, forums, instant messenger and message boards and other services available to you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. We have no control over its use and you should exercise caution when disclosing your personal information to anyone.  If you use a bulletin board or chat room (Cbox) on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 

FilmiCity.in includes links to other websites. Such sites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond our control. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information.

However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our privacy policy from time to time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.

Any questions or clarifications with respect to this Policy can be sent to FilmiCity.in at : filmicity [at] yahoo dot com.
