**Do we use cookies?**

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers’ hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

We use cookies to help make our websites more responsive to the needs of our visitors. The cookies assign each visitor a unique, random number (a sort of user ID) that resides on their computer. The cookie merely identifies the computer that a visitor uses to access our sites. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalized Newsletter/ Horoscope information). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.

The cookies further help to deliver a better service that is keyed to the interests of our visitors. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often and we use cookies to avoid showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit.

If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple process to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser’s Help documentation for more information on this process.
