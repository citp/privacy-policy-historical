**Privacy on Filmygyan**

We at **Filmygyan** respect the privacy of our users and of those who visit anonymously to the website. We want to let you know that how your personal data or information is being used by Filmygyan.

Here are some of the things we cover:

* Collecting information from you

* Using the information that we collect

* The ways you can access and change your information

* How we keep your information safe

 **Information we receive and how it is used:**

We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:

* nbsp; **Your information**

Your information is the information that's required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.

 **Registration information:**

When you sign up for Filmygyan, you are required to provide information such as your name, email address, birthday, and gender. In some cases, you may be able to register using other information, like your telephone number.

User availing services on Filmygyan via other social networking websites allows us to obtain information like User’s Email ID, Contacts, Friends etc. By accessing our app and giving any information, user gives us permission to use information for business purpose.

 **Information you choose to share:**

Your information also includes the information you choose to share on Filmygyan, such as you post a Question, Bio, Status, Upload a photo or Comment on a story, your data is passed on to the site. It also includes the information you choose to share when you communicate with us, such as when you contact us using an email address, or when you take an action, such as when you follow friend, like a Movie Page, use our contact importers, or indicate you are in a relationship.

 **Information about friends, connections and contacts:**

You can choose to invite your friends to join Filmygyan, so that you can stay in touch with them on the site. To make it easier to search and find friends and people you know on Filmygyan, users may search for other members using first and last name, email address and location. If you want to invite your friends and contacts to become a Filmygyan member, we will send an email or an SMS invitation from Filmygyan in your name to your friends and contacts, encouraging them to sign up to Filmygyan.

If any of the people you've invited don't register within a few days, Filmygyan may occasionally send reminder emails or an SMS on your behalf to those individuals. You can choose to invite all your friends or only a select few by simply un-ticking the names of those friends you don't want to invite. It's up to you to ensure that your friends are happy to receive your Filmygyan invite. Otherwise, the only information we hold about your friends and contacts is what you tell us through the site. So, again, think carefully about your posts!

 *** Children's Guidelines ( Children under 13 ):**

You are not allowed to register with Filmygyan or use the site unless you are at least 13 years old. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important, which is why Filmygyan does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Filmygyan services from people under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to those under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Filmygyan services at any time or in any manner. If Filmygyan learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Filmygyan group sites without verified parental consent, then Filmygyan will take the necessary steps to delete this information.

 *** Being Anonymous**

The fact that you can send messages without other people knowing who you are is part of what makes Filmygyan unique and so much fun. It means that you can ask things that you might be too embarrassed or shy to say if anyone knew it was you. People are often bolder and more honest when they are anonymous, whether they're asking a question anonymously, or answering a question where they don't know who's asked it.

Some people don't like receiving things from people if they don't know who they are. So every member can choose not to receive questions from anonymous users on the 'Settings' page.

We all know that some people might abuse the option to be anonymous by being mean or by saying horrible things because they know you don't know who they are, but we will take steps to stop them from spoiling it for everyone else.

We may assist the Police or other law enforcement agencies with their requests to the extent required by law – otherwise, will not tell anyone who you are if you want to remain anonymous.

Occasionally a member may ask us if we can tell them the IP address of someone who sent them an anonymous message. Unfortunately, we are not able to give out that information.
