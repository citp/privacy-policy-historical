# Fifties Website Privacy Policy

PRIVACY POLICY OF FIFTIES WEB  
---  
**Visitors:** I do not collect or distribute my visitors' personal information. Your name, address, phone number, etc, all remain private. If you email me a question or comment, the only person you're gonna hear back from - is me! I hate spam as much as the next person and wouldn't dream of inflicting it on another living soul.  
**Tell a Friend:** The form to recommend this site to a friend is private between you and your friends. I really hope that you will use it, but know that I won't be mailing your friend, nor will anyone else.  
**Still...** Any site (including this one) which utilizes third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the website may use information ( _not_ including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
