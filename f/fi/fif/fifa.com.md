Welcome to FIFA.com (the “ **Website** "), operated by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) (“ **FIFA** ”, “ **We** ”, “ **Our** ”). FIFA takes the Website’s users (“ **User** ”, “ **You** ”, “ **Yourself** ”, “ **Your** ”) privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about Our Privacy Policy and the ways in which We use Your information before You proceed with use of the Website. 

This Privacy Policy has been drafted in English and has been translated in other languages. In the event of any discrepancy between the English and the translated texts, the English text shall prevail and be used to solve doubts of interpretation. 

Date of issue of this Privacy Policy: March 2012 

**International Transfer**

YOUR INFORMATION IS PROCESSED IN SWITZERLAND, AND MAY BE STORED AND USED ELSEWHERE DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION OF AFFILIATES, BUSINESS PARTNERS, AND OTHER ENTITIES WHO ARE PERMITTED TO ACCESS SUCH INFORMATION UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY (AND SUCH LOCATIONS MAY INCLUDE COUNTRIES WHICH MAY NOT AFFORD THE SAME LEVEL OF PROTECTION OF SUCH DATA AS THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH YOU PROVIDED THE INFORMATION). IN SUBMITTING INFORMATION TO US, YOU SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO THAT TRANSFER AND ANY RELATED PURPOSES. 

**The collection of information and how We use it**

The main reason why FIFA collects information is to provide and improve the Website and the services, features and content, to administer Your membership (together, the “Service”) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Website. 

**The information We collect from You**

FIFA collects information when You register for an account and when You enter into transactions, promotions or sweepstakes. The information collected may include but is not limited to the following personal information: e-mail address, last name, first name, country of residence, date of birth, gender, screen name, password, opt-in for game and content preferences. In order to process some of Your transactions through the Website, We may also ask for Your credit card number and billing information 

**Cookies**

When You visit the Website We will, like many other websites, use “cookies” to collect information. Cookies are small data files, which are transferred to a computer’s hard disk in order to memorize information like registration IDs and passwords. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has originated, the "lifetime" of the cookie and various values. 

We further utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Website, to better understand how You interact with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage by Website users and web traffic routing on the Website. Session ID cookies are, unlike persistent cookies, deleted from Your computer when You log off from the Website and close Your browser. 

Please note that You can always choose to block cookies by updating Your Web browser privacy settings. 

To do so, You will have to access the “Help” menu in Your browser’s menu bar and search for the term “cookies”. Please however take note that, if You block cookies, You may not be able to use all sections of the Website or all functionality of the Service. 

Other companies that are presenting advertisements on some pages of the Website may set and access their cookies on Your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. 

**Automatic Information**

FIFA automatically collects some information about Your computer when You visit the Website, regardless of whether You have registered for an account or not by just browsing Our servers. For example, FIFA will collect Your IP address, Web browser software, and referring website. We also may collect information about Your online activity on the Website. Collecting this information helps FIFA customize Your user experience and to monitor and analyze Your use of the Website and the Service. This information is also used for the Website’s technical administration and for the optimization of the Website’s usability and functionalities. 

**How We use Your information**

FIFA uses sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the transaction concluded on the Website. 

We use other information about You for the following general purposes: to provide You with the Service You request; to manage Your account, including processing bills; to communicate with You in general; to respond to Your questions and comments; to notify You about special offers that may be of interest to You; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce Our Terms located at http://www.fifa.com/legal/tos.html; and as otherwise described to You at the point of collection. 

Aggregate information shall also be used to customize the advertising. In using the Website, You expressly entitle FIFA to collect and process Your information in particular for such marketing and customization of the Service. You may always revoke Your consent by deleting Your account. 

**Phishing**

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to FIFA. Safeguarding information to help protect You from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request Your credit card information, Your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

FIFA may send information about You to other companies or people when: 

a) We have Your consent to share the information; or 

b) We need to share Your information to provide the product or service You have requested; or 

c) We provide the information to companies who work on behalf of FIFA under confidentiality agreements; or 

d) We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or 

e) We believe it is necessary, as determined in Our sole discretion, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, emergency situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of FIFA's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

**Security**

We want You to feel confident about using the Website. For that reason, We have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure Your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, the Internet is an open system and We cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use Your information for improper purposes. 

If You communicate with FIFA by e-mail, You should note that the secrecy of Internet e-mail is uncertain. By sending sensitive or confidential e-mail messages or information which are not encrypted You accept the risk of such uncertainty and possible lack of confidentiality over the Internet. 

**Your right to access information**

You are entitled to see the information held about You. If You wish to do this, please use the contact form at <http://www.fifa.com/contact/form.html>_._ We may require You to provide verification of Your identity and to pay an administration fee to provide a copy of the information we hold. Please note that in certain circumstances We may withhold access to Your information where We have the right to do so under current data protection legislation. 

**Updating/deleting Your information**

You may review, correct, update, change or delete Your personal information at any time by accessing Your account on FIFA.com _._ We will attempt to accommodate Your request for deletion if We do not have any legal obligation to retain the record (for logged in users: http://www.fifa.com/theclub/myprofile/profile/edit.htmx) _._

**Links to Other Sites**

If any part of the Website links to other websites, those websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. If You choose to visit an advertiser or click on another third party link, You will be directed to that third party’s website. We do not exercise control over third party websites and therefore recommend You examine the privacy statements posted on these other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing personal information. 

**Our policy towards children**

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without their consent, he or she should delete the account (refer to: Updating/deleting Your information) _._ If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without such consent, we will delete such information from our files.

This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. If We amend this Privacy Policy, We shall place an updated version on this page of the Website. The Website may also provide notices of changes to this Privacy Policy or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices to You generally on the Website. 

**Jurisdiction and applicable law**

This Privacy Policy and all matters arising out of or related to this Privacy Policy shall be governed by the substantive laws and principles of Switzerland, without regards to conflicts of laws and principles thereof. 

Any controversy, claim or dispute between You and FIFA arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Commerce (Handelsgericht) of Zurich, and each party hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such Court.
