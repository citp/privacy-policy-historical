# Fizzy Home :: Support :: Privacy

Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our customers, partners and visitors to our website. The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website and our products and services. This statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.

### What Information Do We Collect?

When you visit our website you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and website use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our website.

## 1\. Personal Information You Choose to Provide

Registration Information:

You will provide us with information about yourself, your firm or company, and your practices when you register for certain services, or register for email newsletters and alerts.

Credit Card Information:

If you choose to purchase products or services from us or our partners, you may need to give personal information and authorization to obtain information from various credit services. For example, you may need to provide the following information:

  * Name
  * Mailing address
  * Email address
  * Credit card number
  * Home and business phone number



Email Information:

If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.

### 2\. Web Site Use Information

Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our website, and the websites visited just before and just after our website.

How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?

**Uses of Your Personal Information**

We use your information primarily to deliver our products to you and to receive payment from you. In order to do this, we may determine if you meet the minimum system requirements to use our products. We may also ask you to participate in surveys about products, services, news and events; we may offer you product upgrades and games for you to purchase.

Notice of New Services and Changes

We may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our website, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. We will only send you this type of communication if we have received your permission to do so. As our customer, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these by contacting our support with your request.

**Third Party Communication of Personal Information**

3RD sense does not use your personal information for purposes incompatible with those listed above. 3RD sense does not sell, rent, or share your personal information to a third party unless you specifically consent to provide such information to a third party partner or content service. Sometimes, certain indirectly identifiable information needs to be communicated with third party servers. We may also disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.

What Are Cookies?

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

IP Addresses

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as "traffic data" so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.

Referrers

A Referrer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as "traffic data". We use traffic data to credit your referral to a partner or affiliate who referred you to our website. This information may also be used by 3RD sense to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.

How Do We Protect Your Information and Secure Information Transmissions?

Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private information to us by email. Some of the information you may enter on our website may be transmitted securely via Secure Sockets Layer SSL, 128 bit encryption services, which are enabled by VeriSign, Inc. Pages utilizing this technology will have URLs that start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. Please contact our support if you have any questions or concerns.

Evaluation of Information Protection Practices

Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the security, confidentiality and quality of our information.

**What About Other websites Linked to Our website?**

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our website nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other websites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our website.

Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

Your Consent

By using our website you consent to our collection and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our Privacy Policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

Modification of Privacy Policy by 3RD sense.

3RD sense reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a notice that we are changing our Privacy Policy.
