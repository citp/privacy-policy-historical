# Privacy Policy | Fitness First Australia

###  Statement Of Confinement

Fitness First is committed to protecting your privacy and any personal information we collect. Fitness First complies with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This policy explains how we may collect, use, disclose and otherwise handle personal and sensitive information.

Fitness First is committed to safeguarding personal privacy. It recognises that individuals have a right to control how their personal information is collected and used. Providing personal information is an act of trust and it is taken seriously. Unless given consent to do otherwise, Fitness First will only collect and use personal information as set out below.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy personal information may mean some or all of the following: a member’s name, contact details, date of birth, emergency contact details, bank account and/or credit card details, student identification details, employment details, payment history and sensitive information.

###  Collecting Personal Information

Fitness First will not collect or monitor any personal information about an individual without their consent.  The only personal information collected is what is provided voluntarily by a member or prospective member. 

We collect personal information primarily to enable us to provide members with our services or functions related thereto. Fitness First may also use the information for marketing to you or for any other purpose permitted under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). 

You don’t need to identify yourself when you deal with us ( e.g. to find out more about membership packages) however in certain situations we will only deal with individuals who have identified themselves to us. 

When a membership or product is purchased personal information will be requested in order to provide the requested service or product, provide updated information, and advise of other Fitness First products, which may be of interest.  You are not obligated to provide personal information however failure to do so may result in Fitness First being unable to provide services or products to you.

Personal information is collected directly from members or potential future members when they personally complete and submit an application form to become a member of Fitness First. This can be done in person at one of our gymnasiums, on line via our website or on the phone via one of our Membership Consultants.

###  Collecting Sensitive Information

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy sensitive information means the information a member has disclosed to us about their physical and mental health and well being. 

Sensitive information will only ever be used for providing services to members. Such information will not be used or disclosed for any other purposes without consent, except in exceptional cases when disclosure may be required by law or is necessary to protect the rights or property of Fitness First, any Fitness First group company, or any member of the public, or to lessen a serious threat to a person's health or safety. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy sensitive information is a subset of personal information.
