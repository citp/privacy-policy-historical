# Privacy policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by Fitness First Australia Pty Limited (ABN 65 094 778 622) ( **Fitness First** ).

#### **1\. Personal information is important**

Fitness First is committed to safeguarding personal privacy. It recognises that individuals have a right to control how their personal information is collected and used.  Providing personal information is an act of trust and it is taken seriously.  Unless given consent to do otherwise, Fitness First will only collect and use personal information as set out below.

#### **2\. Collecting personal information**

Fitness First will not collect or monitor any personal information about an individual without their consent.  The only personal information collected is what has been provided voluntarily.

When a membership or product is purchased or through marketing activities (online, in a club, over the telephone etc.), personal information may be requested (such as name and address) in order to provide the requested service or product, provide upgrades or updated information, and advise of other Fitness First products, which may be of interest.  No one is obligated to provide personal information.  However, failure to do so may result in Fitness First being unable to provide services or products to you.

#### **3\. Use of tracking technologies**

Fitness First uses tracking technologies such as cookies or web beacons to make use of the website and services as convenient as possible.  Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to a computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes.  Web Beacon is a technical method that sends information related to the access to websites, when you browse websites, open or preview an HTML-formatted email.  Most web browsers are set to accept tracking technologies such as cookies or web beacons.  These tracking technologies do not themselves personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser.  These tracking technologies allow Fitness First to monitor the Fitness First web site, and to record how many people are using the different parts of the site. It is possible to set the browser to refuse tracking technologies such as cookies or web beacons, however, this may limit the services provided by Fitness First's web site.

#### **4\. Using and disclosing your personal information**

Personal Information will be used for the following primary purpose:

  * To fulfil obligations under your membership agreement and/or any other contract between you and Fitness First.
  * To render services under your membership agreement.
  * To provide information about products, service and/or special offers.
  * To obtain opinions or comments about products and/or services.
  * To record statistical data for marketing analysis.



Fitness First may employ other companies or individuals to assist us in providing our services, or to provide certain services such as analysing customer lists, providing marketing assistance or consulting services. These third parties may have access to information needed to perform their function but cannot use that information for other purposes.

Fitness First and Fitness First group companies recognise the trust with which individuals provide personal information, and such information will not be used or disclosed for any other purposes without consent, except in exceptional cases when disclosure may be required by law or is necessary to protect the rights or property of Fitness First, any Fitness First group company, or any member of the public, or to lessen a serious threat to a person's health or safety.

#### **5\. Contact by Fitness First**

Fitness First does not send advertising information without obtaining prior consent. If an individual receives communications from Fitness First which they do not wish to receive, they may remove their name from the database by contacting Fitness First at [webeditor@fitnessfirst.com.au](mailto:webeditor@fitnessfirst.com.au).  Please allow 14 days for this request to be processed.

#### **6\. Individual's right of access**

Individuals have the right to review the information that may be recorded on the Fitness First database. Information may be reviewed by completing the access request form at your home club's reception, or by writing to our Privacy Officer (see details below). 

#### **7\. Changing and deleting the information we have about you**

Information contained on the database may be amended by contacting Fitness First at [webeditor@fitnessfirst.com.au](mailto:webeditor@fitnessfirst.com.au). In the same way, a request may be made to delete personal information, and all reasonable steps to delete the information will be made, except where it is required for legal reasons. Deletion of information may result in Fitness First being unable to sell products directly and/or provide certain services including after sales services.

#### **8\. Storage and security of personal information**

Fitness First will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any personal information recorded, and to keep this information accurate and up to date. The information is stored on secure servers if in digital format, or in locked areas if in hardcopy format: these repositories are protected in controlled facilities. In some cases these facilities may be overseas. Fitness First employees and data processors are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by Fitness First. However, security of communications over the Internet cannot be guaranteed, and therefore absolute assurance that information will be secure at all times cannot be given. Fitness First will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to personal information.

#### **9\. Fitness First and links to other web sites**

Fitness First provides links to web sites outside of the Fitness First site. These linked sites are not under the control of Fitness First, and Fitness First is not responsible for the conduct of companies linked to the Fitness First web site, nor for the performance or otherwise of any content and/or software contained in such external websites.

#### **10\. Problems or queries**

Queries relating to the Privacy Policy, or any problems or complaints may be directed to the Privacy Officer at [privacy@fitnessfirst.com.au](mailto:privacy@fitnessfirst.com.au)
