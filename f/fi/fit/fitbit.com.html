                        <b>All users can update their privacy settings at any time by visiting the privacy settings section of their User account on the Fitbit Site.</b></p>

                    <p>Generally, Fitbit limits search engine access to the Site, and instructs search engines not to index user profile pages. However, search engines may access profile information set to the "public" in your privacy setting.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">Third Party Products or Services Offered Through the Fitbit Site</h2>

                    <p>There are a number of separate products and services offered by third parties advertised by us on our Site and through the Service that may be complementary to your use of the Fitbit Products or Service, such as health clubs, weight loss programs and sports and fitness equipment makers (collectively, "Fitbit Offers").  If you choose to use these separate products or services, disclose information to the providers, or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policies. You should evaluate the practices of external service providers before deciding to use their services. Fitbit is not responsible for their privacy practices. If you click on a link to a third party site, Fitbit encourages you to check the privacy policy of that site. Fitbit may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed and whether any action has been taken on a third party web site. We use this information to improve the quality of the Fitbit Offers and customized content on the Service.</p>

                    <p>Third parties offering products or services will not be given your personal information without your explicit permission.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">Contests, Giveaways and Surveys</h2>
                    <p>From time to time, Fitbit may offer you the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions. Any information submitted in connection with such activities will be treated in accordance with this Policy, except as specifically set forth in the rules for those contests, giveaways or promotions. From time to time, Fitbit may also ask you to participate in surveys designed to help Fitbit improve the Service. Any personal information provided to Fitbit in connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey and as elsewhere set forth in this Policy.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">Children</h2>

                    <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.  If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifying information, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">Your Right to Delete Your Data</h2>

                    <p>
                        If you would like to cancel your Fitbit account you may do so by emailing <a href="&#10;http://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/emails/new&#10;">our support</a>
    .
                        When you request cancellation of your account, your personally identifiable information will be deleted, including but not limited your email address, name, photo(s), friends list and links to social and partner sites such as Facebook Twitter, and Google Health.  Archival copies of your account information that exist within our back-up system will be deleted in accordance with our normal back-up expiration schedule.  Following cancellation or termination of your account, Fitbit may continue to utilize de-identified and anonymized historical data associated with your use of the Fitbit Products.  In addition, please note that if you checked the "Allow My Profile to be Found" box in your account settings, a cached version of your profile may continue to be visible to others through search engines.
                    </p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">Email Communications From Us</h2>

                    <p>We may provide our registered customers with weekly summaries of their User Account data and email alerts. We also allow users to subscribe to email newsletters and from time to time may transmit emails promoting Fitbit or third-party goods or services.</p>

                    <p>Fitbit subscribers have the ability to opt-out of receiving our weekly summaries and promotional emails and to terminate their newsletter subscriptions by following the instructions provided in such emails.</p>

                    <p>Opting out in this manner will not end transmission of service-related emails, such as email alerts.</p>

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 25px;">Data Security</h2>

                    <p>We use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your data and to protect Fitbit accounts and systems from unauthorized access.</p>

                    <p>When you register for the Service, Fitbit requires a password from you for your privacy and security. This password is stored in an encrypted fashion on our systems.</p>

                    <p>It is important to understand that these precautions apply only to our Site and systems. We exercise no control over how your information is stored, maintained or displayed by third parties or on third-party sites.</p>

                                The device syncs wirelessly anytime you're relatively motionless within 15 feet of an active base station.

                                You can also sync by placing the device onto the base station. Make sure the base station is plugged in to your computer.
