            <p>Fitbit may also share your personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, order fulfillment, product delivery, customer data management, customer research and the like.  These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Fitbit does business.</p>
            
            <p>We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users or if we are required to do so by any applicable law, rule, regulation, subpoena or other legal process.  Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p>

            <p>We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities and improve our products and the Service. For example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online campaigns or analyze visitor activity on Fitbit.com. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for Fitbit. We do not share any personal information about our customers with these third party service providers, and these service providers do not collect such information on our behalf.
