    <h1>Welcome to Aria
    </h1>
    <p>Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your scale.
    </p>
    <p>The Aria display shows your weight and % body fat stats and uploads them directly to your Fitbit.com account.
    </p>
</script>
<script type="text/html" id="aria101_1_2">
    <h1>How to use the Aria
    </h1>
    <p>Place your scale on a hard, flat surface. It will not be accurate on carpet.
    </p>
    <p>Step on the scale while barefoot, and your weight will appear.
    </p>
    <p>Remain standing on your scale until you've seen your weight, body fat % and user initials.
    </p>
</script>
<script type="text/html" id="aria101_1_3">
    <h1>What you'll see
    </h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>Progress bar
        </dt>
        <dd>Shows you that something is in progress.
        </dd>
        <dt>Sync
        </dt>
        <dd>Your scale is sending information to Fitbit.com.
        </dd>
        <dt>Low Battery
        </dt>
        <dd>Your scale's batteries are 10% full or less, and need changing soon.
        </dd>
        <dt>Wi-Fi Status
        </dt>
        <dd>When connected to a Wi-Fi network, you will see the Wi-Fi icon. You will see an 'X' over the Wi-Fi icon if your scale can't connect to a network.
        </dd>
    </dl>
</script>
<script type="text/html" id="aria101_2_1">
    <h1>Adding people to the scale
    </h1>
    <p>If you want the scale to recognize other people, you will need to invite them to the scale from the device settings page.
    </p>
    <p>Up to 8 people can share the scale at a time.
    </p>
    <p>They will need to accept the invite in order to get body fat readings from the scale.
    </p>
</script>
<script type="text/html" id="aria101_2_2">
    <h1>Keeping your Weight Private
    </h1>
    <p>When you sign up for an account on Fitbit.com or add people to use your scale, your weight and % body fat information is not visible to others by default.
    </p>
    <p>You can choose to make it visible to Friends or the Public (anyone who sees your profile page) by changing your privacy settings.
    </p>
</script>
<script type="text/html" id="aria101_2_3">
    <h1>Recognizing others
    </h1>
    <p>When two people are close in weight, the scale will ask you to step off after showing your weight.
    </p>
    <p>If the initials shown are not yours, tap the scale until yours appear.
    </p>
    <p>Wait 3-4 seconds for the scale to assign the measurement to you.
    </p>
</script>
<script type="text/html" id="aria101_3_1">
    <h1>Badges
    </h1>
    <p>You can earn badges by setting a weight goal.
    </p>
    <p>Every 5lbs of progress towards your goal will earn you a badge.
    </p>
    <p>Lifetime badges will reflect the long-term progress you've made towards your goals.
    </p>
    <p>Badges are awarded privately but you can share them if you choose to. They're our way of saying "Congratulations!" on your hard work.
    </p>
</script>
<script type="text/html" id="aria101_3_2">
    <h1>Tracking your Progress
    </h1>
    <p>Your dashboard's Body module contains a day, week, month and year summary view of your weight change
    </p>
    <p>To reach a certain goal weight, set up a Food Plan for daily estimates of how many calories you should aim to eat.
    </p>
</script>
<script type="text/html" id="aria101_3_3">
    <h1>Get started
    </h1>
    <p>Congratulations, you're ready to get started!

    <p>You can view your weight, BMI and progress from the Body module on your Dashboard.
