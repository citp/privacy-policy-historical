# Privacy Policy - Fitch Ratings

## Policy

Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains the basis upon which we collect and use information, including your personal information on the interactive properties operated and controlled by Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch, we, or us) including, but not limited to, [www.fitchratings.com](http://www.fitchratings.com/) and [www.fitchresearch.com](http://www.fitchresearch.com/) and via any other applications (e.g., our iPad app), interactive features, widgets and resources offered by us through traditional Internet Web sites, mobile devices or other platforms (each a Property collectively, the Properties). Fitch operates the Properties on behalf of itself and its affiliated companies (Affiliates).

Please read through carefully to understand our practices regarding personal information and how we use and treat it.

 **INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

 **Personal Data**

We may collect and process information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you, (e.g., your name, e-mail address, business address, phone number or other identifiers (Personal Data). We request Personal Data from you when you register on any of our Properties. In addition to information collected during registration, we may collect Personal Data that you voluntarily provide, for example, in e-mails to our Properties, online order and registration forms and surveys.

You do not have to provide us with any Personal Data to visit our Properties. If you choose to withhold requested information, however, you may not be able to use all of the features of our Properties.

 **Nonpersonal Data**

In addition to Personal Data, we may collect and/or track information that by itself cannot be used to identify or contact you, (e.g., demographic information (like age, profession or gender), domain names, certain IP addresses, computer type, browser types, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our Properties (Nonpersonal Data).

We use Nonpersonal Data to help us understand who uses our Properties and to improve and market our Properties.

 **IP Addresses**

In addition to the non Nonpersonal Data highlighted above, we may collect certain information about your computer, including, where available, your IP address or other unique identifiers from your device. This information is collected for system administration (for example to enable identification and log-on for certain services), but also to understand more generally about the way users interact with our services. In certain cases, these IP addresses may amount to Personal Data or, when used in combination with other data which we hold, may enable us to identify you. This statistical information is not shared other than with our Affiliates in order to inform internal planning purposes. Once aggregated, this becomes generic Nonpersonal Data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

 **Cookies and other Tracking Tools**

We use certain internet technologies such as cookies, action keys and web bugs, among others (collectively, Tracking Tools). Tracking tools are files or tools that are placed on your computer in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on our Properties. We do not use cookies or Web beacons to collect Personal Data other than certain IP addresses which are treated in accordance with this Policy.

When you visit a Property, we may recognize you by a Tracking Tool and customize your use of that particular Property accordingly (e.g., once you have registered, a cookie will be used to avoid asking you to register again). The information obtained from using these technologies is not sold or otherwise made available to third parties except in accordance with this policy.

The cookies we use are referred to as session or persistent cookies, depending on how long they are used:

Session cookies only last for your online session and disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser.

Persistent cookies stay on your computer or device after the browser has been closed and last for the period of time specified in the cookie. These persistent cookies are activated each time you visit the Property where the cookie was generated.

**HOW WE USE INFORMATION AND WHEN WE MAY SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION GENERALLY**

From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (Third-Party Providers).
