#### **Privacy statement**

Together with any Terms of Use that we may publish, this policy sets out the basis on which we collect, store or process personal or other data that we collect or that you provide to us.  The policy applies to you however you choose to access [www.fits.me](http://www.fits.me/) or the virtual fitting rooms we operate for our clients, i.e., regardless of the network or type of device you may be using.

We collect no identifying information about any individual, either on the website [www.fits.me](http://www.fits.me/) (or its subdomains) or in any of the virtual fitting rooms that we operate for our clients.  This means that we cannot and do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to third parties.

We may, however, publish or otherwise share with clients or potential clients aggregated, anonymous size and shape information about users of our virtual fitting rooms; for example, we may determine average measurements of people at ‘city’ level such as “in Birmingham”.  We may also use such aggregated information to help us, or third parties including but not limited to our virtual fitting room clients, to understand more about the relationships between body shapes, sizes and geography.

In the course of using the virtual fitting rooms we operate, you may be asked to complete surveys for research purposes.  Your response to any such survey is entirely voluntary, and surveys are always conducted anonymously.

Where we interact with you on a third party site such as Facebook or Twitter, you should refer to the privacy policies of the third party site in question.  We do not collect consumer data from these third party sites.  However we may collect data from those sites for business-to-business marketing only, which is excluded from this policy.

We may collect or use information sent to our web servers by your web browser.  The information we collect may include the web pages you access at the [www.fits.me](http://www.fits.me/) domain, its subdomains and in the virtual fitting rooms we operate; your network address; and details of your browser and operating system.  We collect this to measure the performance of our virtual fitting rooms, to help improve the virtual fitting room service we provide and also to improve our own website.  No other information is obtained from your computer/browsing device.

We may use cookies to identify your web browser during and between sessions.  In particular, we may set a browser cookie in order that you do not need to enter your measurements a second time when returning to one of our client’s virtual fitting rooms, or even when visiting the virtual fitting room of a different client.  You may reject these cookies by setting your browser preferences accordingly.

The anonymous data that we collect may be used in any of the following ways: to improve the performance or usability of [www.fits.me](http://www.fits.me/) or its subdomains; to improve the performance or usability of the Fits.me Virtual Fitting Room service; to help us, or third parties including but not limited to our virtual fitting room clients, to understand more about the relationships between body shapes, sizes and geography.

If you object to the collection of any of the anonymous data described above, or the uses of it we have described, you should refrain from using [www.fits.me](http://www.fits.me/) and its subdomains, and also refrain from using the virtual fitting rooms of our clients.  (Note that use of any virtual fitting room is an entirely optional step in the purchase process.)  By using our sites or any Fits.me Virtual Fitting Room you are consenting to the collection of data and its uses as described above.

There are many hyperlinks away from [www.fits.me](http://www.fits.me/) and its subdomains to external sites.  Note that Fits.me is not responsible for the content of external sites.

We may maintain digital or physical copies of any correspondence we are sent.

We may disclose your personal information to any subsidiary company, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985.

Any future changes to our privacy policy will be made on this page.
