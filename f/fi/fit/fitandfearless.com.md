Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 2005  
We collect customer information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, contests, and promotions. We recognize that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly. We do not sell or rent the information you provide to us online to third parties.

If our information practices change in the future, we will let you know by posting the policy changes on our Web site. You will have the opportunity at that time to opt out of any new use of your information.

What kind of information do we collect?  
We collect information (such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and phone and credit card numbers) that you provide when you place an order, register with us or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. We also maintain a record of your product interests and your purchases online.

How do we use your information?   
When you make a purchase from us, we use your information to process your order. We will also send you e-mails to confirm your order, and we may need to contact you via phone, postal mail or e-mail if we have other questions regarding your order. When you register with us or participate in a contest or promotion you may choose to receive e-mails from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. From time to time, we may also send you e-mails to help us learn more about your shopping preferences. In addition, we may use information about your product interests and purchases to help us improve our site design and your shopping experience.

How do I remove my information from e-mail, phone, and postal mailing lists?  
We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive information from us, either through e-mail, postal mail or by phone, please let us know by sending us an e-mail.

Please note that such requests may take up to 2 weeks to become effective. In addition, if you ask us to remove your name and address from our e-mail or postal mailing lists, we will maintain your name in a "do not mail" file to ensure that we can honor your request. Please also note that when you make a purchase, we will send you e-mails to confirm your order and may also need to contact you via phone, postal mail or e-mail if we have other questions regarding your order.

How do we protect kids' privacy?  
Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.

If we become aware that a subscriber is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information from our files.

Please note: we may nevertheless maintain a record of that person's name and address in a "do not register" file to avoid subsequent registration by a child under the age of 13.   
What are cookies? How do we use cookies on its site?  
A cookie is a small data file that Web sites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information (such as a unique user ID), that is used to track the pages of the sites you've visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.

We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. When you visit our site, your cookie helps us keep track of your order as you shop at our site. If you are a registered customer, your cookie allows us to recognize you when you return to our site and provides you with access to your account information. If you register with or order from us, we also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our site. If you have not registered with or ordered from us, we may monitor and maintain information about your use of our Web site in a manner that does not identify you. In either case, this information helps us serve you better by improving our site design, as well as our products, services, contests, and promotions.

We also use cookies to track and maintain the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to ours to further improve our site design and to fulfill contracts with our business partners. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other Web sites.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order or enable you to make a purchase from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user to allow you access to your account information.

How do we make sure your order information is secure?  
Protecting your order information is a priority for us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information.

To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you won't be able to connect to the server and therefore won't be able to place an order through an insecure connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our order form and place your order by phone.
