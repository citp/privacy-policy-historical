# Privacy policy | FitClick

Maintaining your privacy is of paramount concern to Genesant Technologies, Inc. ("GTI"), the owner and operator of FitClick.com (the "Site"). GTI recognizes the premium you place on protecting your privacy, particularly on the Internet. We also understand that your personal fitness is a very private matter. But in order to provide you the full value of our proprietary nutritional analysis software and our dynamic virtual training program, the input of your personal information is necessary. We therefore strive to protect the information you share with us, including information you provide during the registration process that you must complete in order to use the Site and to download the ("MA") to your mobile device, and the information you share on message boards, in chat rooms or within the any other interactive areas of the Site ("Interactive Areas"). 

As a result of our commitment to you and the integrity of your experience with us, we have painstakingly developed this privacy policy (the "Policy") to provide the framework for the use of the information you provide. The following pledges are our guarantees to help you feel more secure in our environment so that you may benefit from the programs we have designed for your overall fitness development. It is our hope that you will accept this Policy with a clear expectation of GTI's obligation to you. 

In this Policy, "we", "us" and "our" collectively refer to GTI. 

**Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect**

GTI does not collect any information that can either be directly used to contact or identify you, or extrapolated to identify or contact you (personally identifiable information, or "PII"), unless this information is provided to us voluntarily. Use of any of the features of MA or the Site (collectively, the "Service"), constitutes the voluntary provision of information to us by any such person who uses the Service (each a "User"). 

**The Circumstances During Which We Collect PII**

1\. Registration

Upon registration with the Site, we collect PII and other information required to create a User account for you and, optionally, to deliver to you a version of MA that is compatible with your mobile device. At this time, this information consists of: 

  * — Your mobile communications carrier (optional)
  * — Your mobile device make and model (optional)
  * — Your mobile phone number (optional)
  * — Your email address
  * — Your gender
  * — Your age
  * — A "screen name" that you will use to indetify yourself on the Site
  * — A password for logging in to the Site

  
This information will be stored in an internal database that is proprietary to GTI. Other than as necessary to create your User account, deliver the proper version of MA to your mobile device or for the various other uses disclosed in this Policy, we will only use this information to determine the appropriateness of, and thus whether to display to you, certain content on the Site. We do not serve content on the Site in a personally identifiable manner; rather, the software we use entreats this task in a closed database environment. 

2\. Configuration of a Customized Diet or Workout Program

To fully benefit from the Service, you will be required to enter medical history data and personal data that we use to calibrate the mechanisms of our nutritional analysis software and our dynamic virtual training program. 

3\. In Connection With Promotional Campaigns

From time to time, either GTI or a third party may host a promotional campaign on or through the Service. These campaigns have a variety of objectives such as ensuring that we are satisfying your needs, assessing the performance of areas or aspects of the Service and introducing new products or offers. In these cases a specialty promotional privacy statement will be implemented in the framework of the promotion, which will give specific direction as to the treatment of collected information. Oftentimes the information will be necessary for the fulfillment obligation of a prize or sample. GTI conducts all promotional campaigns within the guidelines of this Policy. 

**What We Do With Your PII**

PII of individual Users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the User's prior consent. We may, however, in certain limited circumstances provide PII: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or court order; or (2) in special cases such as a physical threat to you or others. 

The Site stores the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer when you visit the Site. This information is only used to create broad demographic summaries of where our Users come from; for example, we know what percentage of Users come from Europe or Africa, but our use of the IP addresses does not include identifying who those Users actually are. However, GTI may use registration information and other voluntarily submitted information in the following ways: 

  * — To provide our employees with information that is useful in developing new features for the Service; 
  * — To provide advertisers with aggregate -- never individual -- information about our Users and their usage patterns (for more on Aggregate Information, see below); 
  * — To allow us to potentially vary advertising based on User preference; and 
  * — To provide Users with an individual experience when using the Service through personalization.

  
GTI reserves the right to perform statistical analyses and profiling of User behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various aspects of the Service and to inform partners of such information. GTI will provide only aggregate data from these analyses to third parties; no PII will be disclosed. 

GTI may, at some time, permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through the Site. In this event, GTI will not be responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and Users should check the applicable privacy policy of such third party before providing PII. 

It is not possible for a User to delete his or her profile from our database, nor is it feasible to delete all traces of a User's activity in the system. Messages posted to message boards are examples of User activities that are not feasible to delete. 

GTI may send regular email updates to Users. If you wish to have your email address deleted from our database, please use [this form](https://web.archive.org/www/main/EmailUnsubscribe.aspx). Please allow two to three business days for the actual cancellation to take effect. We will not share your email address with third parties without first receiving your permission. 

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose PII (for example, name or email address) in Interactive Areas of the Site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the User's communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of GTI. GTI makes no warranties about the discoverability of a User's identity by methods beyond our control. 

**We Use Cookies**

The Site employs cookie technology to allow Users to move more quickly through the Site. Cookies are small text files a Website can use to recognize repeat users and facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site. Generally cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning website. They do not pose a threat to a user's files. Users should be aware that GTI cannot control the use of cookies by advertisers or third parties hosting data for the Site. However, if a User does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the User to deny or accept the cookie feature. Please note that cookies may be necessary to provide the User with certain features (for example, customized delivery of information) available on the Site. 

**Aggregate Information**

In most cases, GTI will provide aggregate information about you, which does not allow you to be personally identified or contacted ("Aggregate Information") to third parties. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of members enrolled in a particular workout program who are over the age of 25. We might also inform a fitness apparel manufacturer (that may or may not be an advertiser on our site) that 45% of the women on the site participate in aerobics programs. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge them for this information. 

**Internal Privacy**

GTI utilizes databases to produce results of our Service's performance and give us measurements regarding the activity of the Service. This enables us to continually refine and improve the Service for you. Only authorized GTI employees are permitted access to your PII and all GTI employees are required to abide by this Policy. Those who violate the terms of this Policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 

**Your Choice**

When you register on the Site, you will be given the opportunity to either choose to receive or decline to receive informational/promotional emails and offers from GTI. 

**Internet-based Advertising**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use information other than PII about your visits to the Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

We also use Remarking with Google Analytics for Display Advertisers and may remarket our services or products to our visitors by showing them ads on sites across the Internet. We use third party advertising vendors, including Google, that use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website. You may opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers and opt out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the [Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/).

You are always welcome to contact us in order to delete your PII from our databases, to update your profile and to change your preferences with respect to marketing contacts. Our postal address is: Genesant Technologies, Inc., 8150 Leesburg Pike, Suite 400, Vienna, VA 22182. Our telephone number is 703-204-1301. 

As we grow and offer you new service features, we will continually evaluate this Policy to ensure that your anonymity is maintained and to protect your personal information. Should we change an aspect of this Policy, we will note that change with an update marker in the text; however, our pledge to keeping your trust by maintaining the highest privacy standards will not deviate. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy or any revised policy, please exit the Site immediately and discontinue use of the Service.
