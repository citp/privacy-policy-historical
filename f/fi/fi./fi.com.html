<h3 class="bodyMainTitle">Privacy Policy</h3>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Last Revised: October 26, 2004</h5>
<h5 class="bodySubTitle"><i>Our commitment to you:  User data and contact information obtained by Fisher Investments will never be shared for commercial purposes.</i></h5>

</a><p class="bodyText"><a name="top">If you have any questions concerning Fisher Investment's Privacy Policy, please send us an email to </a><a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>. We'll be glad to help!</p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Introduction</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments provides investment management services to prestigious institutions and individuals worldwide. As a world-class organization, we are committed to providing the highest quality of service to all of our customers.  We also have a responsibility to our customers, the public, and our profession to deliver our services in a professional manner, with uncompromising values and standards. As such, the firm must and will in all respects comply with all relevant Federal and State laws, regulations and requirements.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments is committed to providing you with a clear explanation of its Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers privacy issues as they relate to US, Canada, and UK online marketing initiatives and www.fi.com, www.fi-canada.com, www.fisherinvestments.co.uk, www.fi-inst.com, and all respective subdirectories.</p>

<p class="bodyText"></p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">General</h5>

<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments 
  collects contact information and other relevant data  from prospective clients so that we can provide them with the information they've requested - either directly from Fisher Investments or through one of our marketing partners.
   <i>Please note that this information comes from people who specifically request information through Fisher Investments' website or from clearly labeled advertising.</i></p>

<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments collects contact information and other relevant data from prospective employees 
  via our website.</p>
<p class="bodyText">All personal information submitted to us will be held confidential and will not be shared for commercial purposes.</p>  
  
<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Email</h5>  
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments sponsors third party email content. 
  In order to receive Fisher Investments' email content through a third party, 
  an individual would have had to previously subscribed to a particular service or "opted-in" 
  to receive relevant promotional content from advertising partners. As advertisers, 
  we do not gain access to users' contact information—this information is 
  kept confidential by the content owner—nor does Fisher Investments supply additional users from 
  our own internal database. Rather, the respective online publisher distributes 
  content on our behalf.</p>
<p class="bodyText">If you have received Fisher Investments' email content through 
  a third party, you must unsubscribe or "opt-out" through the respective 
  publisher. The only way to avoid receiving future promotional offers (from Fisher Investments or other companies) is by going directly 
  to the respective publisher and unsubscribing from their list.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments does, however, maintain a suppression file 
  of email addresses in compliance with the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 (S.877). This 
  list is updated daily and provided to publishers with instructions to exclude 
  the respective email addresses from Fisher Investments sponsored email campaigns. For instructions 
  on adding your name to Fisher Investments' email suppression file, see the section 
  called "Removal from the Fisher Investments Database."</p>
<p class="bodyText"></p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Online Advertising</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments' online advertising is in full compliance with 
  Internet, advertising and finance industry standards and regulations. Our advertising 
  content is integrated and delivered with online publisher's primary content 
  in a variety of different formats; some in graphical format (e.g. banner) and others in text format. 
</p>
<p class="bodyText">The delivery of our online advertisements (and frequency thereof) 
  is ultimately controlled by the respective online publisher. Unfortunately, 
  we are unable to suppress or restrict the delivery of our online advertisements 
  to individual users. Many publishers offer "frequency capping" to 
  limit the number of advertisements a user will receive on a periodic basis. 
  However, this functionality will NOT work if you have disabled "cookies" 
  in your browser. For example, if you are experiencing a high volume of online 
  advertisements in general (like pop-up ads), then it might be an issue with 
  your Internet browser's ability to accept "cookies". It is important 
  that you have "cookies" enabled in your browser settings.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments collects aggregate performance data on 
  its online advertising. This information is anonymous and not personally identifiable. 
  It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. 
  In addition, service providers and the media owners themselves may track behavior 
  of users visiting their web sites, such as domain type, IP address, and clickstream 
  data. <i>Please note that this information is not individually identifiable</i>.</p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Cookies</h5>
<p class="bodyText">What is a "cookie"? A cookie is a small data file 
  containing information, such as a link that a user clicked on, which is written 
  to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. 
  With cookies, the information is anonymous and not personally identifiable. 
  It does not contain personal information such as name, address, telephone number, 
  or email address. It also does not contain user passwords. The individual information 
  gathered in this manner is used for internal purposes only, such as looking 
  at unique page views and customizing content. We also use the information on 
  an aggregate basis, to track the usage of our website and to analyze traffic 
  patterns. </p>
<p class="bodyText">You can control your browser's settings regarding cookies 
  by selecting "Internet Options" or "Preferences" in the 
  menu bar of your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting 
  new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or 
  disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies provide benefits like streamlining 
  the website so visitors can find the information they are looking for more easily, 
  we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>


<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Partners</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Certain partner organizations have limited access to online 
  performance data (e.g. cookie data) in order to help Fisher Investments get 
  a better understanding of the users visiting its website. The data they maintain for Fisher 
  Investments helps us optimize the use of our website. 
  <i>Note: Personal data obtained by Fisher Investments will not be shared for commercial 
  purposes</i>.</p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">General Privacy Notice for Fisher Investments' Clients</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments collects nonpublic information about users from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information received on applications or other forms</li>
  <li>Information provided orally</li>
  <li>Information about transactions or online behavior with Fisher Investments 
    or other publishers </li>
</ul>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about its clients or non-clients without explicit authorization from the respective party, except as permitted by law or in response to inquires from governmental authorities.</p>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments restricts access to personal and account information to those personnel who need to know that information to conduct business. Fisher Investments may also disclose that information to unaffiliated third parties (such as to brokers or custodians) only as permitted by law and only as needed for Fisher Investments to provide agreed services to clients. Fisher Investments maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard nonpublic personal information.</p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Privacy Policy Updates</h5>
<p class="bodyText">From time to time, Fisher Investments may use data for new, 
  unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If its information 
  practices change at some time in the future Fisher Investments will post the 
  policy changes to its website to notify users of these changes. If users are 
  concerned about how information is used, they should check back to this location 
  periodically.</p>


<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Updating or Correcting Personal Information</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Upon request, Fisher Investments will provide site visitors 
  with access to respective contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number) 
  that is maintained about them. To access this information, please email <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>. 
  Upon request, Fisher Investments will also offer visitors the ability to have 
  inaccuracies corrected in the database. Users can have this information corrected 
  by sending email to <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>. </p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Removal from the Fisher Investments Database</h5>
<p class="bodyText">If contact information is willingly provided to Fisher Investments 
  by mail, phone, email, online, or otherwise, in response to our marketing activities, 
  individuals may receive subsequent periodic information from Fisher Investments 
  on new products and services or upcoming events. If individuals don't wish to 
  receive such information, please let Fisher Investments know by sending an email 
  to <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>, or by 
  writing to the following address: </p>
<p align="center">Fisher Investments
	<br>ATTN: Marketing Department
	<br>13100 Skyline Boulevard
	<br>Woodside, CA 94062
</p>
<p class="bodyText">Please provide Fisher Investments with the exact name and 
  address as it was originally provided. We will be happy to remove your name 
  from our database and will do everything possible to honor your request for 
  removal.</p>
<p class="bodyText">To unsubscribe from Fisher Investments' email communications, 
  send an email to <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:optout@fi.com">optout@fi.com</a>. Please put "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject 
  field and include the email address where you received the content, along with 
  any additional email addresses you would like suppressed. We will do our best 
  to prevent you from receiving our email content in the future. </p>

<h5 class="bodySubTitle">Security</h5>
<p class="bodyText">Fisher Investments has appropriate security measures in place 
  at its physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration 
  of private information collected from users. If users feel that this website 
  is not following its stated privacy policy, they are encouraged to contact Fisher 
  Investments at <a class="bodyLink" href="mailto:privacy@fi.com">privacy@fi.com</a>. </p>
