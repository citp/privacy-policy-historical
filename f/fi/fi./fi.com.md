### Privacy Policy

##### Last Revised: October 26, 2004

##### _Our commitment to you: User data and contact information obtained by Fisher Investments will never be shared for commercial purposes._

If you have any questions concerning Fisher Investment's Privacy Policy, please send us an email to [privacy@fi.com](mailto:privacy@fi.com). We'll be glad to help!

##### Introduction

Fisher Investments provides investment management services to prestigious institutions and individuals worldwide. As a world-class organization, we are committed to providing the highest quality of service to all of our customers. We also have a responsibility to our customers, the public, and our profession to deliver our services in a professional manner, with uncompromising values and standards. As such, the firm must and will in all respects comply with all relevant Federal and State laws, regulations and requirements.

Fisher Investments is committed to providing you with a clear explanation of its Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers privacy issues as they relate to US, Canada, and UK online marketing initiatives and www.fi.com, www.fi-canada.com, www.fisherinvestments.co.uk, www.fi-inst.com, and all respective subdirectories.

##### General

Fisher Investments collects contact information and other relevant data from prospective clients so that we can provide them with the information they've requested - either directly from Fisher Investments or through one of our marketing partners. _Please note that this information comes from people who specifically request information through Fisher Investments' website or from clearly labeled advertising._

Fisher Investments collects contact information and other relevant data from prospective employees via our website.

All personal information submitted to us will be held confidential and will not be shared for commercial purposes.

##### Email

Fisher Investments sponsors third party email content. In order to receive Fisher Investments' email content through a third party, an individual would have had to previously subscribed to a particular service or "opted-in" to receive relevant promotional content from advertising partners. As advertisers, we do not gain access to users' contact information—this information is kept confidential by the content owner—nor does Fisher Investments supply additional users from our own internal database. Rather, the respective online publisher distributes content on our behalf.

If you have received Fisher Investments' email content through a third party, you must unsubscribe or "opt-out" through the respective publisher. The only way to avoid receiving future promotional offers (from Fisher Investments or other companies) is by going directly to the respective publisher and unsubscribing from their list.

Fisher Investments does, however, maintain a suppression file of email addresses in compliance with the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 (S.877). This list is updated daily and provided to publishers with instructions to exclude the respective email addresses from Fisher Investments sponsored email campaigns. For instructions on adding your name to Fisher Investments' email suppression file, see the section called "Removal from the Fisher Investments Database."

##### Online Advertising

Fisher Investments' online advertising is in full compliance with Internet, advertising and finance industry standards and regulations. Our advertising content is integrated and delivered with online publisher's primary content in a variety of different formats; some in graphical format (e.g. banner) and others in text format. 

The delivery of our online advertisements (and frequency thereof) is ultimately controlled by the respective online publisher. Unfortunately, we are unable to suppress or restrict the delivery of our online advertisements to individual users. Many publishers offer "frequency capping" to limit the number of advertisements a user will receive on a periodic basis. However, this functionality will NOT work if you have disabled "cookies" in your browser. For example, if you are experiencing a high volume of online advertisements in general (like pop-up ads), then it might be an issue with your Internet browser's ability to accept "cookies". It is important that you have "cookies" enabled in your browser settings.

Fisher Investments collects aggregate performance data on its online advertising. This information is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. In addition, service providers and the media owners themselves may track behavior of users visiting their web sites, such as domain type, IP address, and clickstream data. _Please note that this information is not individually identifiable_.

##### Cookies

What is a "cookie"? A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a link that a user clicked on, which is written to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. With cookies, the information is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain personal information such as name, address, telephone number, or email address. It also does not contain user passwords. The individual information gathered in this manner is used for internal purposes only, such as looking at unique page views and customizing content. We also use the information on an aggregate basis, to track the usage of our website and to analyze traffic patterns. 

You can control your browser's settings regarding cookies by selecting "Internet Options" or "Preferences" in the menu bar of your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies provide benefits like streamlining the website so visitors can find the information they are looking for more easily, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

##### Partners

Certain partner organizations have limited access to online performance data (e.g. cookie data) in order to help Fisher Investments get a better understanding of the users visiting its website. The data they maintain for Fisher Investments helps us optimize the use of our website. _Note: Personal data obtained by Fisher Investments will not be shared for commercial purposes_.

Fisher Investments maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard nonpublic personal information.
