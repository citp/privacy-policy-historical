Users can also access this privacy policy via our homepage and from the bottom of every page by clicking on the appropriate link in the footer.

Fisher Investments and its associated companies are committed to respecting users’ privacy. We have structured our website so that, in general, users can visit Fisher Investments on the web without identifying themselves or revealing any personal information. Once users choose to provide Fisher Investments with any information by which users can be identified, users can be assured that it will only be collected, used and shared in accordance with this privacy policy.

**Background**

Fisher Investments is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an investment adviser, and is required to comply with SEC Regulation S-P (“Reg. S-P”), as well as the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”). Reg. S-P and the GLB Act require Fisher Investments to have policies and procedures in place to protect the security and confidentiality of the non-public personal information of consumers and customers, and to provide a privacy notice to such persons describing our privacy policies and procedures.

To ensure consumer privacy laws are not violated, Fisher Investments has adopted the policies and procedures described under the “Privacy Notice” heading below, which govern the activities of each officer, member, director, trustee and employee of Fisher Investments (collectively called the “Personnel”).

**Glossary**

“Consumer” – an individual or an individual's legal representative that obtains or has obtained a financial product or service to be used primarily for personal, household or family purposes. A person becomes a consumer even if a questionnaire or application is withdrawn or denied or an advisory agreement does not become effective.

“Customer” – a consumer that has an ongoing relationship with Fisher Investments, whereby Fisher Investments is providing one or more financial products or services to the consumer (e.g., an advisory client of Fisher Investments).

“Nonpublic personal information” –

  * All personally identifiable financial information.
  * While the GLB Act excludes publicly available information (e.g., a list of persons and their publicly listed telephone numbers), nonpublic personal information does include any list, description or other grouping of consumers (and publicly available information pertaining to them) derived using any nonpublic personally identifiable financial information that is not publicly available information.
