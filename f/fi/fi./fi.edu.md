If you send us personal information—by submitting an e-mail, completing an online form, requesting materials or information, ordering Institute tickets, making a donation, or signing up for membership—we will use this information to respond to your inquiry or request. We may also use it to contact you to provide information about other Institute activities, programs, membership and fundraising opportunities, products, and special events that may interest you. You may opt-out of having your information used by the Institute for these purposes, or you may update your contact information anytime, by contacting us via the following e-mail or postal mail addresses:

The Franklin Institute does not sell, exchange, or release website visitor's names, e-mail addresses, or other individually identifying information to parties outside of the Institute, except to third party contractors performing services, to the extent necessary to comply with applicable laws or valid legal processes, to protect the rights and property of the Institute, or to provide the services or information you have requested. 

Users should be aware that the Institute contracts with several third-party vendors to provide certain services made available on and to process transactions made through this website. Use of these services is subject to the privacy policies of such third-party vendors (identified below). 

The Franklin Institute provides visitors with an opportunity to make a contribution to our organization through an online donation page.
