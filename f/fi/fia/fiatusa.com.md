**_Right to Non-Discrimination_** _._ The CCPA prohibits discrimination against California residents for exercising their rights under the CCPA. A business may offer financial incentives for the collection, sale or deletion of California residents’ personal information, provided it is not unjust, unreasonable, coercive or usurious, and is made available in compliance with applicable transparency, informed consent, and opt-out requirements. California residents have the right to be notified of any financial incentives offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be included in such incentives without their prior informed opt-in consent.  

**_You Rights Under California’s Shine-the-Light Law._ **Under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83), California residents who provide us their personal information are entitled to request and obtain from us, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we have shared with third parties for their own direct marketing use; such requests may be made once per calendar year for information about any relevant third party sharing in the prior calendar year (so, requests submitted in 2020 would be applicable to relevant disclosures (if any) in 2019). If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing by emailing us at _[dprivacy@fcagroup.com](mailto:dprivacy@fcagroup.com)_ , using the subject line “ **CA Shine the Light Request.** ”  In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address.  We will reply to valid requests by sending a response to the email address from which you submitted your request.  Please note that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing and the relevant details required by the Shine the Light law will be included in our response.
