CHRYSLER GROUP LLC

PRIVACY POLICY

Effective Date: August 30, 2010

Welcome to the Chrysler Group LLC (“Chrysler”). At the Chrysler family of companies, we believe it is important to protect the privacy of our customers and guests. We know that you care about how your personal information is collected, used, and shared and we want to help you make knowledgeable choices about the information you provide to us. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains and summarizes how Chrysler collects, uses, and protects your information, including the personal information that you may provide to us or that we may collect from you as you interact with us online, through mobile device applications, and through our customer and technical support services. We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check back with us periodically.

This Privacy Policy applies to this website or application, Chrysler controlled websites or applications, and all Chrysler controlled applications accessed and/or used on a mobile or handheld device (each a “Website” or “Application”). By using this Website or Application, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information by Chrysler consistent with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy which is expressly incorporated into any applicable Website or Application Terms of Use.

This Privacy Policy explains the information practices of Chrysler including:

  * How Chrysler uses the personal information you share with us and that we learn about you because of our relationship.
  * How Chrysler uses “cookies” and related information collected automatically when you use our Website or Applications.
  * What personal information, if any, Chrysler may share about you and the conditions we use to protect your information if it must be shared.
  * What kind of security measures Chrysler takes to protect your information from accidental loss or disclosure and how Chrysler will inform you in the event of a security breach.
  * The process through which you can access personal information you share with Chrysler and have that information corrected, restrict Chrysler’s use of that information, or have it removed from our records.
  * Other things you should know about privacy and Chrysler.
  * Much of this policy relates to personal Information. “Personal information” includes information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you.



## COLLECTED INFORMATION AND USAGE

Chrysler collects and uses the information you provide to us, including information obtained from your use of this Chrysler Website or Application. We may also obtain information about you from outside sources. For example, we may request credit information about you from credit agencies for the purpose of providing a service to you, obtain commercially available demographic and marketing information about you from third parties, or purchase e-mail or similar lists from third parties for advertising and marketing purposes. We may use or share your Personal Information (e.g., name, address, telephone number, email address, and location) where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something that you have asked us to do. We may also use this information for our internal research purposes as we develop our products and services and for advertising and marketing.

For example, we might need to provide your name, address, phone number, or email to one of our dealers or another party with whom we have a relationship so that they can help us respond to you or a request you made through one of our Websites. Chrysler employees, agents, and service providers, who need to access Personal Information you have provided to fulfill their responsibilities, may do so consistent with Chrysler policies that limit access to this type of information. Chrysler’s vendors and suppliers may process your personal data under the direction of Chrysler.

Chrysler collects and uses information from you in several ways:

Website or Application Usage. Chrysler (or Chrysler vendors and suppliers) may observe your activities, preferences, and transactional data (such as your IP address and browser type) as well as pages you have viewed during your use of the Website or Application. We may use this data for any purpose unless we tell you otherwise in connection with a particular Website or Application. While we may collect or log this information, we do not identify you or match this non-Personal Information with your other Personal Information unless or except if we believe doing so will help us better respond to a request you have made such as for a quote, identification of a local dealer, or similar request. With the exception of Location-Data, described below, where such non-Personal Information is linked to your Personal Information we will treat such information as Personal Information.

Location Data. Some Chrysler Websites or Applications may need to capture and record certain location-data regarding your use of that Website or Application and your travels in order to provide location-related functionality (“Location-Data”). We may link that Location-Data to other information that you provide to us or that may be accessed in connection with your use of such a Chrysler Website or Application. Your use of, and our ability to offer functionality through, the Chrysler Website or Application is then enabled through our use and disclosure to third parties of Location-Data and associated information.

E-Commerce. You may be asked to share Personal Information such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. When you purchase a Chrysler product online, seek a quote or ask to locate a dealer, you may be asked for information needed to complete your request and provide related customer service. This information you provide is used, for example, to process your transactions, to create and share aggregate reports about these transactions, and to perform credit fraud screening services for transactions between you and Chrysler and/or our authorized service providers. When you shop online or buy direct from one of our online stores, these purchase transactions may be conducted through Chrysler vendors and suppliers. Vendors and suppliers engaged by Chrysler may have their use of your Personal Information limited by this Privacy Policy, contractual restrictions, and applicable law. Chrysler (through its vendors or suppliers) may limit the acceptance of orders to particular jurisdictions and as permitted by applicable law.

Product Registration & Technical Support. Chrysler may allow customers to register their products online through similar ways. Personal Information or data provided for such purposes may be used to carry out the request, service, or agreement for which the information is submitted. With your consent, we may also use the information you provide in online registration forms to notify you periodically about important changes to the Website or Application (such as a change to this Privacy Policy or notice of a security breach), new Chrysler products and services, and special offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. If you register, we may ask for, among other things, your name, address, email, telephone number, type of product purchased, or other product-identifying information.

Failure to register any Chrysler product will not diminish the rights you have under the applicable product warranty.

Online Promotions, Contests and Sweepstakes. You may be asked to provide an email address or screen name, or other Personal Information, for entry into a particular promotion, including sweepstakes and contests, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. The specific rules and regulations governing the particular promotion, contest or sweepstakes will vary and your participation constitutes your agreement to abide by those rules and regulations.

Certain promotions, contests or sweepstakes may be run by a Chrysler service provider or vendor or co-branded with one of our partners. In these instances the collection of your Personal Information may occur directly by the service provider or vendor or a third-party partner on their website. The promotion will state the privacy policy or policies governing the collection of such information if they should differ from this Privacy Policy.
