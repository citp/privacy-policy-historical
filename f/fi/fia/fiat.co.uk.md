If a User consents to us doing so, we will send them relevant marketing information and carry out market research about our products and services so that they don’t miss out on current offers. If Users tell us that they want to receive communication that is specific to them, then we will analyse their personal preferences, interests or behaviours so that we can send them customised communication that we think they might like. If Users tell us that they are interested in receiving relevant offers from others companies that might interest them, then we will share their Data with companies in our group and selected partners in the automotive, financial, insurance and telecommunication sectors with whom we work closely. As we are always looking to make the User’s experience better, we also use the Data to improve our websites. We normally process the Data by automated or electronic means through our websites and mobile apps. We also process data through electronic means, including e-mails and by phone (e.g. SMS, MMS and fax).
