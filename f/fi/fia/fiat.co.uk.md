For more information about us and how you can contact us please see the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=3046 "contact| us") section. The financial services available from the [Finance](https://web.archive.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=2570 "fiat finance services") section of the Fiat website (within Tell me about Fiat) are provided by Fiat Consumer Services, a trading style of FGA Capital UK Limited.

Fiat Group Automobiles SpA is the Italian parent company of the Fiat companies operating in the UK and any references to the "Fiat Group" in this policy are references to Fiat Group Automobiles SpA and its subsidiary companies.

Fiat is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. We have established this privacy policy to demonstrate the care with which we will treat your information.

### _Privacy_

We will always respect your privacy and any personal information that you give us. We will always endeavour to comply with the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and any associated legal regulations concerning data protection.

When you visit this website, your personal data is only stored if submitted by you when requesting information or using any service available on the site, for example where you might request a test drive or register your details in the 'My Garage' section or request an insurance quote from Fiat Consumer Services†.

### _Use_ of your information

This policy describes how we and other companies in the Fiat Group (collectively referred to as "we") intend to use your personal information. If this differs for any reason, such as in the case of data relating to children, we will make this clear at the time of data collection.

If you make a specific request for us to contact you, such as requesting a brochure, we will use the personal information you provide to fulfil your enquiry. We may disclose your information to Fiat Appointed companies and agents for this purpose. Where you request a service provided independently by our franchised dealers or by other Fiat Appointed companies (for example, a test drive or a quote from Fiat Insurance), we may share your information with them to fulfil this request. At any page on this web site where you have the opportunity to submit your personal information, you will be given the opportunity to object to us, our franchised dealers and other Fiat Appointed Companies making further use of your data. You will also be given the opportunity to specify whether we, our franchised dealers and other Fiat Appointed Companies can communicate with you by e-mail, SMS and/or fax.

If you do not object to us making further use of your data we, our franchised dealers or other Fiat Appointed Companies may keep your data for a reasonable period and use the data given for our own internal research purposes or to contact you in the future to let you know about Fiat's other products and services (such as motor insurance or financial products) or special offers that might be of interest to you or to ask you what you think of us in order to improve our customer service.

We will only contact you by e-mail, SMS or fax if you have consented to our doing so. For these purposes, your personal information may be passed to and processed by Fiat Group Automobiles SpA., other Fiat Group companies, Fiat's franchised dealers and other agents who act under our direction. We may also share your information with our franchised dealers for use in connection with their business as Fiat franchised dealers. You may hear separately from our franchised dealers about our ranges of Fiat, Alfa Romeo or Fiat Commercial Vehicles or from our agents and representatives about related motoring products and services, such as motor insurance or financial products.

Fiat will not pass your details to unrelated third party organisations except where we are legally obliged to do so (for example in relation to vehicle safety issues or financial regulation) or in order to prevent and detect fraud.

To help us to make credit decisions about you, to prevent fraud, to check your identity and to prevent money laundering, we may search the files of credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your file. We may also disclose details of how you conduct your account to such agencies. The information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially associated, for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors.

### _Your_ consent

By submitting your information to Fiat, you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. Continued use of the service will signify that you agree to any such changes.

If you give us information about another person, you confirm that the other person has appointed you to act on his/her behalf and has agreed that you can give consent on his/her behalf to the processing of his/her personal data in accordance with this policy.

### _Forward_ to a friend

If you use the 'forward to a friend' facility, Fiat Group Automobiles UK Ltd will pass your name and email address to the friend you are forwarding the information to.

### _Right_ to object

You have the right to correct any inaccuracies in the personal data we hold about you, or to change your mind about the usage rights you have given us. Write to us at Fiat Group Automobiles UK Ltd, 240 Bath Road, Slough, Berkshire, SL1 4DX United Kingdom. You also have the right to ask us for a copy of the information about you, which we hold on our systems. We may charge you a small fee for the provision of this information to cover administration costs.

### _Updating_ your details

If any of the information that you have provided to us changes, for example if you change your e-mail address, name or payment details or if you wish to cancel your registration, please let us know the correct details by sending an e-mail to [contactfiat@uk-central.com](mailto:contactfiat@uk-central.com "contactfiat@uk-central.com") or by writing to us at Fiat Group Automobiles UK Ltd, 240 Bath Road, Slough, Berkshire, SL1 4DX United Kingdom.

### _Children_

We may occasionally create on-line games, which children may play. Parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a Child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.

### _Security_

Fiat strictly protects the security of your personal information and your choices for its intended use. We use current industry standard technology to maintain the confidentiality and accuracy of the information you provide to us. To protect your personal information, we use "secure servers" with industry standard SSL 128 bit key encryption. However, the internet is not a secure medium so we cannot guarantee that any information you submit to us will be free from unauthorised third party intrusion.

### _Cookies_

We use cookies to enhance the level of service we provide to you. Essentially a cookie is an identification card, which is uniquely yours and which is stored on your computer's hard disc. A cookie can only be read by the server that transmitted it to your computer. Cookies record the areas of the site you visit and the length of time you spend viewing them. By using cookies we will be able to see how our website is being used. This means we'll be able to identify the most popular areas of our website and make it easier for you to access them. It will help us to be more efficient as we can learn what information is important to our customers and what isn't. We can also discard web pages you don't use, and focus our efforts on delivering the information you need.

It is possible to set your computer to let you know when a cookie is issued, receive a warning before a cookie is stored or you can choose to disable them. You will need to refer to your browser instructions to do this but you should be aware that if you disable the cookies this will prevent us from providing you with certain personalised services and some parts of the site may not be accessible to you.
