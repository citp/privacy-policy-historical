By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our websites to our visitors. We collect this information through “cookies” and IP addresses.  


_Cookies_  


Like many organizations, we may use “cookies” on this website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.  


Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all our website features.  


_Log Files, Usage Data and IP Addresses_  


Log files are web server files (containing information such as domain name or IP address, URL, http response code, or the date and duration of your visit) that are automatically created when an Internet user visits a website. An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit our website, our servers log your IP address. In combination with other data, this information helps us understand which features are of interest to our visitors and the regions of the world where these visitors are located. In addition, log files help detect disruptions that may interfere with the provision of our website.

We take steps to require that service providers protect the information consistently with this Online Privacy Notice. These service providers are authorized to use the information only as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with law or legal process. Where we have knowledge that a service provider processes your personal information in a manner contrary to this Online Privacy Notice, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the processing. In addition, we may disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process; (2) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials; (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (4) if this is necessary to protect the vital interests of any person.  


We also reserve the right to transfer personal information about you in the event we sell, transfer or merge all or a portion of the business or assets. Should such a sale, merger or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to direct the transferee to use information that is consistent with this Online Privacy Notice.
