Information We Collect and How We Use It   


**Personal Information We Collect About You**  


If you email us through the “Contact Us” link on this site, you may choose to provide personal information to us such as your name, email address, resume or CV. You may choose to provide additional information as well. We use the information you provide to respond to and communicate with you about your questions and comments.  


**Information We Collect by Automated Means**  


We may collect certain information by automated means when you visit this website, such as how many users visited the site and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our websites to our visitors. We collect this information through “cookies” and IP addresses.  


_Cookies_  


Like many organizations, we may use “cookies” on this website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.  


Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all our website features.  


_Log Files, Usage Data and IP Addresses_  


Log files are web server files (containing information such as domain name or IP address, URL, http response code, or the date and duration of your visit) that are automatically created when an Internet user visits a website. An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit our website, our servers log your IP address. In combination with other data, this information helps us understand which features are of interest to our visitors and the regions of the world where these visitors are located. In addition, log files help detect disruptions that may interfere with the provision of our website.  


Information We Share  


We do not disclose personal information about visitors to this website, except as described here. We will not sell, share, transfer, rent or distribute your information for purposes other than those disclosed here unless required by law or as authorized by you. We may share the information you provide among our subsidiaries and affiliates. We also may share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. These service providers are authorized to use the information only as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with law or legal process. In addition, we may disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process; (2) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials; (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (4) if this is necessary to protect the vital interests of any person.  


We also reserve the right to transfer personal information about you in the event we sell, transfer or merge all or a portion of the business or assets. Should such a sale, merger or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to direct the transferee use information that is consistent with this Online Privacy Notice.  


How We Protect Personal Information  


We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of personal information.  


Links to Other Websites  


Our website may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites may operate independently from Fragomen. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. To the extent any linked websites you visit are not owned or controlled by Fragomen, we are not responsible for the sites’ content, any use of the sites, or the privacy practices of the sites.
