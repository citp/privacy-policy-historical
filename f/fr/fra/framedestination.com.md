**Frame Destination, Inc. Privacy Policy**

By viewing or using the Frame Destination website or related websites, you agree to the   
terms of our Privacy Policy, as outlined below. If you do not agree to these terms, please   
do not access or use this site. Frame Destination, Inc. reserves the right to change the   
Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion. Your use of this site will be subject to   
the most current version of the Privacy Policy at the time of such use. However, we do not   
intend to change the fundamental tenet of this policy -- your information will not be sold to   
anyone outside of Frame Destination, Inc. The information we collect is solely for the

about a user.

Collection of Personal Information  


|   
| 

When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as ordering products, Frame   
Destination, Inc. may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and   
submitting an online form. It is optional for you to provide your information and engage in   
these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Frame Destination, Inc.   
may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name,   
mailing address and telephone numbers. When ordering products or services on the site,   
you may be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of   
the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as   
voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you   
will not be able to engage in that activity.

Security  


|   
| 

Please note that any area of our site that requires you to reveal financially sensitive   
information (ie, your Credit Card number) to continue with an activity -- such as an online   
purchase -- is located on a Secure Server(s).

Cookies  


|   
| 

Some sections of our site utilize cookies as a convenience for our visitors. As an example   
\- whenever a visitor fills out an online form, we set a cookie, and if accepted, it will prevent   
the visitor from having to reenter their information for any other online form on the site. So if   
you provide your info on our Contact form, you will not be required to fill out the Online   
Video access form. However, you will be required to enter your information on our Order   
System as we need the most current information you can provide for order fulfillment. Most   
browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when   
you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. While   
Frame Destination, Inc. uses cookies to track your visit to our website, and our Web   
servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, this information does   
not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise   
provided Frame Destination, Inc. with personal information.  


|   
| 

Consistency  


|   
| 

Please note that if you provide Frame Destination, Inc. with inconsistent privacy   
preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion that we may contact you with   
marketing offers and indicating on another occasion that we may not), Frame Destination,   
Inc. cannot guarantee that your most recent privacy preference will be honored. Outside   
Sites, please note that Frame Destination, Inc. is not responsible for the content or privacy   
practices of non-Frame Destination, Inc. websites to which this site or any other Frame   
Destination, Inc. website may link.
