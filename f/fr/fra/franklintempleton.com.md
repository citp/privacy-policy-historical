## Our Mutual Fund Privacy Notice

### Your Privacy Is Our Priority

Franklin Templeton Investments is committed to safeguarding information provided to us by individual shareholders of our U.S.-based Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series Funds. This notice is designed to provide you with a summary of the non-public personal information we may collect and maintain about current or former investors; our policy regarding the use of that information; and the measures we take to safeguard the information. The Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series Funds, Franklin/Templeton Distributors, Inc., Templeton/Franklin Investment Services, Inc., and Fiduciary Trust International of the South (“FTIOS”), custodian for retirement plans, (together referred to as “we,” “our” and “us” throughout this notice) do not sell non-public personal information to anyone and only share it as described in this notice.

### Information We Collect

When you invest in our Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series Funds or establish a retirement plan with FTIOS as custodian, you provide us with your non-public personal information. We collect and use this information to service your accounts and respond to your requests. The non-public personal information we collect falls into the following categories:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, whether we receive the form in writing or electronically. For example, this information includes your name, address, tax identification number, birth date, investment selection, beneficiary information, and possibly your personal bank account information and/or email address if you have provided that information.
  * Information about your transactions and account history with us, or with other companies that are part of Franklin Templeton Investments, including transactions you request on our website. This category also includes your communications to us concerning your investments.
  * Other general information that we may obtain about you such as demographic information.



### Disclosure Policy

To better service your accounts and process transactions or services you’ve requested, we may share non-public personal information with other Franklin Templeton Investments’ companies. From time to time we may also send you information about products/services offered by other Franklin Templeton Investments’ companies although we will not share your non-public personal information with these companies without first offering you the opportunity to prevent that sharing.

We will only share non-public personal information with outside parties in the limited circumstances permitted by law. For example, this includes situations where we need to share information with companies who work on our behalf to service or maintain your account or process transactions you’ve requested, when the disclosure is to companies assisting us with our own marketing efforts, when the disclosure is to a party representing you, or when required by law (for example, in response to legal process). Additionally, we will ensure that any outside companies working on our behalf, or with whom we have joint marketing agreements, are under contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality of your information, and to use it only to provide the services we’ve asked them to perform.

### Confidentiality and Security

Our employees are required to follow procedures with respect to maintaining the confidentiality of our investors’ non-public personal information. Additionally, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information. This includes performing ongoing evaluations of our systems containing investor information and making changes when appropriate.
