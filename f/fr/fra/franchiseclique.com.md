# Privacy Policy | FranchiseClique.com

Effective on May 20, 2016 

This privacy policy describes how FranchiseClique.com, owned and operated by Franchise Clique collects and uses the personal information you provide on our website: www.franchiseclique.com. At FranchiseClique.com, we only use personal information that you provide in the way we specify when we collect it. We take our privacy seriously, and this policy covers data used in our websites, mobile apps, email, and text-messaging services. 

### Our Website

All users can view content on our website without submitting any personal information (such as name, address, phone number, etc.) to us. However, in order to provide you with a better user experience, we may collect non-personal information from your computer using cookies. More information on this process is below. 

### Mobile Apps and Location Information

When you download or use our mobile apps, you may give permission to share your device's real-time location (from cell towers or GPS). This information is used to provide services like localized search results. You can disable location-sharing at any time in your device settings. We also use an encrypted version of your device's unique device ID to track app usage, and to send any mobile alerts that you ask you to receive. 

### Our Information Request Form

When you request information by submitting your contact information (name, address, phone number, e-mail, etc.) on our registration form, we pass your information only to the businesses that you specify. No other business receives your contact information. Your information, however, is often stored in the receiving company's database, as well as ours. Collected data may be stored in a database outside your home country. 

### Our Newsletter Program

We offer opportunities to register to receive our e-mail newsletter, both in various locations on our website and on our Information Request Form. We only add you to our mailing list if you authorize us to. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing our unsubscribe page, or you can contact us at info@franchiseclique.com. Moreover, we do not share your e-mail address or other personal information with other companies unless authorized by you.

Cookies and web beacons can tell us what advertising you have seen on the Site, which allows FranchiseClique.com to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information and also may be used together to measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. Cookies, web beacons, and IP addresses are also used to compile data regarding Site usage (e.g., what website you came from, what pages of the Site you visit, how long you were on the Site, what type of browser you are using, what website you went to). Web beacons may also be included in emails sent by FranchiseClique.com to determine when and if such emails are opened or forwarded.

In such cases, FranchiseClique.com asks that the third party maintain your personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the services specified by FranchiseClique.com.
  6. Email List Opt-Outs. In the event FranchiseClique.com sends promotional emails to you on behalf of third-party advertisers and you inform FranchiseClique.com you wish to opt out of future promotional emails from a particular third party, FranchiseClique.com may share your email address with that third party so the third party may add you to its opt-out lists.
