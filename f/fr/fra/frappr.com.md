Welcome to Frappr!, a service operated by Rising Concepts LLC (hereinafter referred to as "Frappr!") which includes Frappr! software, content, related documentation, information on the Frappr! domain, and information made available by users to each other through the Frappr! software (collectively, the "Service"). Your privacy is important to us and as described in this Privacy Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your personal identifying information when you use the Service, whether on our website or through a tool on someone else's website. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us. 

From time to time, we may update the Privacy Policy and we will post a notice of significant changes on the website www.Frappr!.com.

2.|  **What We Collect**  
When you register to become a member of Frappr!, we collect your name, email address and other personal information that you submit. As part of your personal profile, you may choose to make available to us additional personal information such as gender, age, occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc., as well as other content, such as blogs (web logs), titles in your media library and photos. It is entirely up to you whether you want to submit this additional information, and whether you would like to make it available to other members. The Service allows Admins of a Frappr! Group to choose not to list their Group in the directory by going to "Settings" and selecting the appropriate option. However, Frappr! has no responsibility for how people who are allowed to view your personal information or content use that material. 

When you invite new members into your Group or send messages through the Frappr! service, we collect and maintain on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content. In addition, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer, such as such as browser type and IP address. 

Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain reports on web casting of images, we collect aggregate information about your use of the Service.

3.|  **How We Use Your Information**  
We make your profile and other user information (other than your email address and password) available to other users. If you are in a Group, your Group Admin may restrict access to certain information by adjusting the privacy settings set as part of your/your Group's profile. Your user name will be identified to us and to any recipient of messages you send through the Service. We also use your name, email address and other information on our system to notify you of new product releases, service notifications, content that may be of interest, and solicit your feedback and input. If you use Frappr! to access and/or modify an account you may have with another service provider, any information you enter (such as usernames) will be used solely in the course of accessing that account, or allowing such modification, and will not be saved in your publicly available profile. 

You understand and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your personal information and the contents of your account if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of our affiliates or the public. Frappr! may also delete certain content in whole or in part if Frappr! determines, in its sole discretion, that such content constitutes an "Infringing Posting" or a "Prohibited Posting" as defined in our [Terms of Use](http://www.frappr.com/?a=doc&section=tou). 

We also use non-personally identifiable information and certain technical information about your computer in order to operate, maintain and manage the Service.
