# Legal — Fractal Design

This is the part we’re betting you won’t read. Partly because we’d like to think you know how serious we are about GDPR, personal integrity and cyber-security, but mainly because legal texts just aren’t a lot of fun. But transparency is important, and we want you to know what data we collect, why we do so and how we use it.

The tools we feed your data are SendInBlue (e-mail marketing, see segment 3 below) and Google Analytics in order to learn more about how our website is used.
