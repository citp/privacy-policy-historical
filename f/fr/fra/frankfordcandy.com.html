	<h3>Frankford Online Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company, 
      Inc., Inc. is committed to protecting 
      your online privacy when visiting a 
      website operated by us. We do not collect 
      and keep any personal information online 
      from you unless you volunteer it and 
      you are 13 or older. We also do not 
      collect and keep personal information 
      online from children under the age of 
      13 without consent of a parent or legal 
      guardian, except in limited circumstances 
      authorized by law and described in this 
      policy. Please review the information 
      below to familiarize yourself with our 
      policies on website privacy, so that 
      you can take full advantage of all the 
      fun activities available at our sites 
      for you and your family. Please remember 
      that this site and the servers that 
      make this site available are located 
      in the U.S. By using this site you agree 
      to the transfer, collection, processing 
      and use of data by this site. </p>

A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS: <br>
<p>Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company, Inc. adheres to the Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the guidelines
of the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better
Business Bureaus,
Inc. in each of our websites for children. You can
help by spending time online with your children and monitoring your children's
online use.
Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing
them never to provide personal information on this site or any other
without your
permission.</p>

<p><strong>If you are under 18, please be sure to read this policy with
your parents or legal guardians and ask questions about things you do
not understand.
Children under 13 should get your parent's or legal
guardian’s
permission before giving out your e-mail address or
any personal information to Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company, Inc. or to anyone else on the Internet. </strong><br>
</p>
    <p> Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company, 
      Inc. doesn't require anyone to share 
      any personal information about themselves 
      in order to enjoy any of our website. 
      That means you can visit our site without 
      any need to register with us. We do 
      not collect personal information online 
      from children under 13 without consent 
      of a parent or legal guardian except 
      in special, limited circumstances. If 
      your child is under 13 and wants to 
      use our sites with special activities, 
      like scavenger hunts, personalized pages, 
      games or clubs, we might ask your child 
      to “register.” They can 
      often do so anonymously by just providing 
      a user name and password, but sometimes 
      we need their first name and e-mail 
      address. When we ask for your child's 
      first name, your child is encouraged 
      to use a "screen name" (not 
      their real name) that only they know. 
      Sometimes we will ask your child to 
      make up a special password so that only 
      they can see their customized areas 
      on the site. With your verifiable consent, 
      we may collect personal information 
      from your child such as a last name, 
      address or e-mail address when the information 
      is necessary for a particular activity. 
      If we need more than just your child's 
      first name (or screen name) and e-mail 
      address for your child to participate 
      in a particular online activity, we 
      will ask your child for your e-mail 
      or mailing address so that we can notify 
      you of your child's request and get 
      your permission. When we ask for your 
      permission, we will tell you what we 
      will do with the information you or 
      your child provides us, and we will 
      tell you how you can review your child's 
      information and ask us to delete the 
      information. We don't keep your (or 
      your child's) e-mail address unless 
      you tell us it is okay. </p>

<p>
Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company, Inc. might collect an e-mail address and first name
(or screen name) from your child under 13 without your consent, but only
in the following special cases: </p>
	<ul><li>If a child under 13 sends a request to us, we keep their e-mail
		address for long enough to respond to them. Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company, Inc. deletes this information
		from our system after we answer their question.<br>
	</li>
	  <li>If a child under 13 signs up for an e-mail newsletter, or other activity
		that requires multiple online contact with the child, we also ask the
		child for a parent's or legal guardian’s e-mail address so we
	can notify you and give you an opportunity to opt out. <br>
	</li>
	  <li>Occasionally, Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company, Inc. has special site activities or promotions like
		sweepstakes or contests that are open to children even if they are
		under 13. In these activities, we are not allowed to ask for more information
		from your child than what is necessary for your child to participate
	in the activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       						</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In the latter situation we require your child to give us your e-mail
	  address, too, so that we can tell you that they have registered in a
	  promotion or for a service. If we need more than an e-mail address and
	  first name (or screen name) to enter your child in the promotion or offer
	  the service, we will notify you, explain what information we need and
	  why, and generally ask that you (not your child) provide it. For instance,
	  we might ask you for your mailing address so that we can send to you,
	  for your child, any prizes your child wins, or for your telephone number
	  so that we can tell you when your child has won. Any information you
	  or your child give us in the above special circumstances will be deleted
	  from our database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded,
	  and after any legally required period for keeping such information is
	  complete. </p>

	  <h3>About Cookies</h3>
	  <p>A "cookie" is a small file that we save on your computer’s
	  hard drive that contains non-personal information. Our cookies help to
	  give you faster access to pages you have already visited; they allow
	  you to personalize your pages and us to customize our offerings; and
	  they help you to participate in some activities or events on the site.
	  For instance, if we have have scavenger or treasure hunts, and
	  we need to use cookies to keep track of your progress. If you leave the
	  site and then return, cookies will tell us what things you have already
	  collected so that you do not have to start all over again. Cookies keep
	  track of items in your shopping cart and wish list in our online stores.
	  We also use cookies to help us figure out how many people visit our sites,
	  which of our Web pages they stop at and how long they stay there. This
	  information helps us figure out which of our Web features are successes
	  and what sites might need improvement. For administrative purposes, we
	  collect IP addresses, which is the automatic number assigned to your
	  computer when you surf the Web. Certain Internet Service Providers may
	  assign the same IP address to many users. The IP address allows us to
	  count the total number of "hits" on our sites. However, your
	  IP address and cookie are not connected to any personally identifiable
	  or online contact information like a name and address, so you and your
	  family remain anonymous. We also use other technology, called clear GIFs,
	  to provide us with other important anonymous information, such as when
	  an e-mail has been opened. </p>


	  <p>Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company, Inc. does not collect information passively through
	  cookies or other tracking mechanisms except in the circumstances described
	  above. Cookies DON'T contain any personal information about a specific
	  user. We don't use cookies or other non-consensual methods to take personally
	  identifiable or online contact information about you or your family off
	  of your computer. Except for certain activities like treasure hunts,
	  which we talked about above, Frankford Candy and Chocolate Company, Inc. doesn't use cookies for direct marketing
	  or promotional purposes. Cookies are also not used to collect information
	  specifically about you or your family for sharing with third parties. </p>

	  <p><b>And Finally...</b><br>
	  We want you and your family to have fun surfing all
