# Friends Reunited - Privacy Policy

**FriendsReunited Privacy Policy**

This is a legal document which sets out how FriendsReunited handles data which identifies you. You should read it in conjunction with the [FriendsReunited Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20030621142457id_/http%3A//www.friendsreunited.co.uk/friendsreunited.asp?wci=terms), of which this Privacy Policy forms part.

At FriendsReunited, we believe strongly in protecting the privacy of our users’ personal information. This statement describes the privacy practices we apply for the FriendsReunited Service. As part of that, it also expresses our approach to complying with the data protection laws which apply in the United Kingdom. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of the changed document in the same way as we notify changes to the [FriendsReunited Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20030621142457id_/http%3A//www.friendsreunited.co.uk/friendsreunited.asp?wci=terms).

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact FriendsReunited's [ customer service department](https://web.archive.org/web/20030621142457id_/http%3A//www.friendsreunited.co.uk/friendsreunited.asp?wci=contactus&email=info&subject=privacy). 

  1. **The information we gather and track.**


  * **Information gathered on registration.** When you register for the FriendsReunited Service, you provide your name, your name on leaving school, the year you left school, your email address, and some optional notes about yourself ("Registration Information"). They are available to you, and capable of being changed, through the Your Details page.


  * **Cookies.** We use small files known as "cookies" to enhance users’ experience of the FriendsReunited Service as follows:


    * To hold Members’ login information, so that your school is displayed when you visit the FriendsReunited Service. This option can be turned off by switching the "Remember Your Password" option to "No" in Your Details.
    * To facilitate optimal use of the FriendsReunited Service by Members, by means of a temporary "session" cookie. These cookies disappear when the Member’s browser session ends, or if the Member clicks the "logoff" text which appears on the FriendsReunited Service.
    * Third party cookies are used on some parts of the site. They are used for tracking the success of advertising campaigns. These cookies are normally permanent. Blocking of third party cookies by users will not affect the functionality of the website.  




**2\. Sharing and use of information**

  * The over-riding principles we apply are these:


    * **We, and (where relevant) our credit card processing agents, will not supply your personal data to a third party for commercial exploitation – thus, you can rest assured that we will not sell the lists of our Members’ email addresses to a third party; and**
    * **the only circumstances in which we will provide any of your personal data to a third party for non-commercial purposes are those contained in this Privacy Policy.**


  * **Registration Information.** Once a Member selects a school, some or all of the Registration Information held for that Member, except for the email address, will be available at the listing for that school.


  * **Email addresses.** We do not directly make your email address available to anyone on any screen of the FriendsReunited Service. The only legitimate way of making contact with a friend found on the FriendsReunited Service is for a Full Member to enter a message which we will send on the Member’s behalf. The email sent will include the sending Full Member’s email address so that the recipient can respond to the sender directly. This means by sending a contact message, the sending Member is disclosing his/her email address. Members may change their email address at any time through Your Details. Members’ personal notes must **not** include their email address. If your email system automatically responds to a contact email, your email address will be revealed.


  * **Advertising.** The FriendsReunited Service may include interactive advertising for other businesses. We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymised demographic data provided by Members to target this advertising more appropriately.


  * **Newsletters.** We have regular and occasional emails, which Members can decide to take or not, according to their preferences. This option is selected through Your Details.


  * **Credit Card information.** There has been a lot of publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet so we decided to use Worldpay plc, who operate a secure server, to process our credit card payments. They encrypt Members’ credit or debit card information and authorise payment directly. This means that Members’ credit card details are never revealed to us. Worldpay plc may transfer to, process and hold your credit card information in countries either within or outside the European Economic Area in connection with performing their duties.


  * **Companies in the Friends Reunited group.** We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in our group, but only for the purposes described in this policy.


  * **Changes in Friends Reunited's business.** If all of the assets which Friends Reunited uses to operate its business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party.


  * **Place of processing.** The personal information held by us is held on and processed by computers situated in the United Kingdom.


  3. **Security**



We have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains each Member’s responsibility:

  * to protect against unauthorised access to Your Details;


  * to ensure against use by anyone else of the FriendsReunited Service through the machine that Member uses while they are "logged on" to theFriendsReunited Service;


  * to log off or exit from the FriendsReunited Service when not using it; and


  * to keep his/her password secret.


  4. **Opt-out policy**

****
  * You may have your registration details removed at any time. To remove yourself please click [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20030621142457id_/http%3A//www.friendsreunited.co.uk/friendsreunited.asp?wci=unregister) and we will remove all Your Details.


  * We provide Members with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving e-mailed Newsletters which they have previously opted to receive. This opt-out can be effected by making appropriate selections at Your Details.


  5. **Disclosure for legal reasons**



We reserve the right to communicate such of a Member’s personal information as we hold to third parties which seek the disclosure of it, and which make a legally-compliant request for its disclosure.
