      <p><strong>Information - Collection, Sharing  and Disclosure</strong><br>
        Our  primary aim in collecting information is to provide and improve our services,  features and content, to administer your membership and to enable you to enjoy  and further facilitate you in relishing the premium quality digital  experience&nbsp; brought to you by FRIDAYMOVIEZ.COM.<br>
        Your IP address is used in  diagnosing problems with our server and administering our website and services.  Through our surveys, subscriptions, and registrations, we request users to give  us contact, demographic and/or financial information (like name, locale,  gender, age, income level and email address) so that we could enhance our user  experience by being more content specific. The contact information is used to  notify users of new services and content, as well as for surveys and  newsletters. Our site may use an order form for customers to subscribe to our  for-pay services. We collect contact information (like e-mail address) and  financial information (like account or credit card numbers). Contact  information from the order form is used to send billing invoices. </p>
      <p>Contact information is also used  to get in touch with the subscribers when necessary. Users may opt-out of  receiving future communications by unsubscribing. Financial information that is  collected is used, among other things, to bill the user for products and  services for in-house statistics, advertising, and marketing target  information. We do not share personal financial information with any other  parties without your consent. Information collected during registration is used  for in-house statistics and marketing target information. This site contains  links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the  content of such websites or any website from which you may have linked to us.  We are committed to protecting your privacy online. We collect certain personal  information in order to provide you with customized services, content, and  advertisements. We may disclose to third parties certain aggregate information  only when such action is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal  process, or to enforce the terms of service. </p>
      <p>We will also use your personal  information for the purposes of providing you with any services to which you  subscribe, service-related activities and notifying you or contacting you  regarding any problem with, or the expiration of, such services. We recommend  that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your  password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember  to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you have  finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal  information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are  using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. This  privacy policy is not intended to, and does not create any contractual or other  legal rights in or on behalf of us. <br>
