**We may share information with joint promotion partners.** Sometimes we conduct joint promotions with third parties.

**We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves.** For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests. We might share information when we are investigating potential fraud. This might include fraud we think has happened during a sweepstakes or promotion.

Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still send you transactional messages and respond to questions from you.

**CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.  
** ****  
If you reside in California, you have the right to ask us one time each year if we have shared personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make a request, please send us an email or write to us at the address listed below. Indicate in your letter that you are a California resident making a “shine the light” inquiry.

**OUR SITES ARE NOT FOR KIDS.**

Our sites and apps are meant for adults and teens. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child under 13 has given us information, you can [contact us.](https://web.archive.org/contact) Parents can learn more about how to protect children's privacy on-line here: <https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/protecting-kids-online>

**WE USE STANDARD SECURITY MEASURES.**

The Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords. We keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Policy. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.

**WE STORE INFORMATION IN THE UNITED STATES.** If you live outside of the U.S., you understand and agree that we may transfer your information to the United States. This site is subject to U.S. laws, which may not afford the same level of protection as those in your country.

**WE MAY LINK TO OTHER SITES OR HAVE THIRD PARTY SERVICES ON OUR SITE WE DON’T CONTROL.** If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to websites or pages we do not control. This includes social media sites. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third party websites. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for third party policies or practices.

Our site may also serve third party content that contains the third party’s own cookies or tracking technologies. We do not control the use of those technologies.

**WE USE COMMON TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES.  
**  
We collect personal information about users over time and across different Web sites when you use this Web site or service. We also have third parties that collect personal information this way. We use several common tracking tools to do this. Our vendors may also use these tools. These tools may include browser cookies or web beacons. We use these tools:

 **YOU CAN CONTROL TRACKING TOOLS.  
**  
Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. If you block cookies on your browser, certain features on our sites may not work. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.

You can control tools on your mobile devices. For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your phone. Each push notification has an “unsubscribe” link. Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.

**OUR ADS MAY BE SERVED BASED ON TRACKING.  
**  
We may work with online advertising companies to show you relevant and useful ads. This includes ads served on other companies’ sites. These ads may be served based on information collected by us or third parties. For example, information a third party collects when you register for a site, like your zip code. This might be used to target an ad for people in your area. These ads may also be based on your activities on our websites or on third party sites.

**YOU CAN OPT-OUT OF ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING.** To opt out of having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes, visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific.

**CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.** If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact Frito-Lay Consumer Relations:
