<p>
<b>What information do we collect about you?</b>
</p>

<p>We may collect and process the following information about you: </p>

<p>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our site (the '<b>Site</b>') (including your personal details, contact details, mobile phone number and other profile information you submit when you create a membership profile). We may also collect information when you voluntarily complete customer surveys, provide feedback and participate in competitions.

</p>

<p>
Website usage information is also collected using cookies (see below under 'Cookies'). </p>

<p>
<b>How will we use the information about you?</b>
</p>

<p>We
