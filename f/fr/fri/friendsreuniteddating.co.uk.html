                            Service. The only legitimate way of making contact 
                            with another Member as a result of viewing a search 
                            result found on the FriendsReunitedDating Service 
                            is for a Full Member to enter a message which we will 
                            send on the Full Member's behalf to the Member. The 
                            email sent will include the sending Full Member's 
                            email address so that the recipient can respond to 
                            the sender directly. This means by sending a contact 
                            message, the sending Member is disclosing his/her 
                            email address. Members may change their email address

                            include interactive advertising for other businesses. 
                            We may use, and provide to third parties, anonymised 
                            demographic data provided by Members to target this 
                            advertising more appropriately. <br><br>

                            to their preferences. This option is selected through 
                            Member Details. <br>

                          </li>
                          <li>Credit Card information. There has been a lot of 
                            publicity about Credit Card security on the Internet 
                            so we decided to use Worldpay Limited, who operate 
                            a secure server, to process our credit card payments. 
                            They encrypt Members' credit or debit card information 
                            and authorise payment directly. This means that Members' 
                            credit card details are never revealed to us. Worldpay 
                            Limited may transfer to, process and hold your credit 
                            card information in countries either within or outside 
                            the European Economic Area in connection with performing 
                            their duties. <br>

                          <li>Companies in the FriendsReunitedDating group. We 
                            may share data supplied by you (or collected about 
                            you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in 
                            our group, but only for the purposes described in 
                            this policy.<br>

                            all of the assets which we use to operate our business 
                            (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third 
                            party, we may transfer personal data we then hold
