# Privacy Policy - Referral Marketing Programs | Customer Referral Software

Last Updated March 14, 2014

## PRIVACY POLICY

Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information about you when you use the Friendbuy website (“Site”) and other Friendbuy services (together, our “services”).

In this Privacy Policy, “you” refers to any user of our Site or services, including retailers, publishers, merchants and others who have an account with Friendbuy (“Merchants”) and customers and other end users of Merchants (“End Users”). Below, we describe how we treat the information we receive from Merchants and End Users.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

### Merchant Information

If you register to create a Friendbuy account, we will collect your email address, full name and any other information you voluntarily submit to us (“Merchant Information”). When you make a purchase on our Site, Friendbuy utilizes a third party payment processor that collects your credit card information, mailing address and other billing information solely to process payments on Friendbuy’s behalf.

### End User Information

If you use any Friendbuy widgets or other Friendbuy services as an End User, we may collect: (i) your e-mail address, (ii) any information you submit on a Friendbuy widget, (iii) any information that you give us permission to access via social media authorization tokens (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) and (iv) any other information or content you post on, or using, our services (collectively, “End User Information”).

### Automated Information

This section applies to everyone who uses the services: Merchants, End Users and anyone else who navigates to the Site. When you visit the Site or use our services (including using Friendbuy widgets on a Merchant website), we automatically collect information from your browser, including your IP address and data about the pages you visit using the services.

Like most other online businesses, we may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons, and other automated mechanisms to keep track of user interactions with our Site and our services. Through these mechanisms we may collect information such as your mobile device’s UDID, your computer’s IP address and the type of browser you are using.

## HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

### Merchant Information

We use Merchant Information to provide and improve our services, to facilitate billing and payment for sale and purchase transactions, to authenticate a Merchant’s identity, to contact Merchants about their accounts and for internal reporting and planning. We may also use this information to provide Merchants with useful advertising and offers. Merchants can opt out of receiving commercial emails from us by clicking on the opt-out link in the emails that are sent by Friendbuy.

### End User Information

We use End User Information to operate the services we provide to Merchants.

We share the End User Information only with the Merchant on whose website the End User entered the information or who otherwise facilitated the End User’s use of our services. End User Information is not shared with or sold to any other organizations for third party marketing purposes. If an End User provides any information directly to the Merchant, the information will be subject to the Merchant’s privacy policy; Friendbuy has no control over what Merchant does with such information.

We may share non-personally identifiable statistical data about an End User’s use of the services with third parties, for example, through reports with aggregated and anonymous information. These reports do not include personal information that can be used to identify or contact an End User.

### Automated Information

We use automated information from Merchants to provide and improve our services and from time to time, to make Merchants aware of new products and offers from Friendbuy.

We use automated information from End Users to provide and improve our services.

## THIRD PARTIES

Except as specified in this Privacy Policy, Friendbuy will not sell, share or disclose information about you to any third party without your express consent.

In addition to the specific reasons we may share Merchant Information, End User Information and Automated Information stated above, we may share your information in the following circumstances:

  * We may share your information if we believe it is reasonable to do so in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We may disclose your information in response to a subpoena or compulsory process, if requested by a law enforcement or regulatory agency, or if needed to comply with any applicable laws, to prevent imminent harm or financial loss, or to investigate or take action relating to illegal activities, suspected fraud, or violations of our Terms of Service. We also reserve the right to provide your information to a third party if we believe such disclosure may prevent harm or liability to us, to our other users or to a third party.
  * We may transfer information about you as part of due diligence or an actual or potential sale or merger of our business.
  * We may share your information with any third party who is helping us provide the services (e.g., credit card and other payment processors).
  * We may use third party analytics services, such as Google Analytics. These services may use technical means such as cookies (which are text files placed on your computer) to collect information that will be transmitted to and stored on their servers. These analytics services use this information to evaluate your use of our services, compile reports on website activity and provide us with other services. They may also transfer information to third parties if they are legally required to do so or where such third parties process information on their behalf. You can refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser but if you do so, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the services. By using the services, you consent to our analytics providers’ processing your data as described above.



## POSTED CONTENT

If any End User information is posted on a website or social media channel, such information can be read, collected and used by others. We advise against posting personal information in publicly visible areas.

## SECURITY

We take the security of your personal information very seriously. We ask that you also take responsibility for protecting your password and safeguarding your account against unauthorized access. While we strive to protect the personal information you give us, we cannot guarantee its absolute security because no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is entirely secure.

## RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may keep Merchant Information as long as a Merchant has an account with us or as needed to provide the services to the Merchant. We may also retain and use Merchant Information after an account is closed if we believe it is necessary or beneficial for legal compliance or to resolve disputes, operate our business or enforce our agreements. We may retain End User Information and automated information indefinitely, including after the associated Merchant account is closed.

## MODIFICATIONS AND CHANGES

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We will let you know of any changes by posting a notice on the Site and/or by notifying you via email. Any changes will take place at the time of posting and will not apply retroactively without your consent, unless they are required by law to do so.

## LOCATION OF YOUR INFORMATION

Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers outside your country. We may process and store information in the United States and other countries and your use of our services constitutes your consent to and understanding of this transfer and processing.

## CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, users who are California residents are entitled to request and receive once a year, free of charge, a notice from us describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared, the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, and their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to 3415 Sepulveda Boulevard, Suite 340, Los Angeles, CA 90034. In your request, please specify that you want a “California Privacy Rights Notice.” Please allow at least thirty days for a response.
