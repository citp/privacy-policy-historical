#### Overview

As part of the normal operation of our services we collect information about you in order to offer the highest possibility of finding a partner through our site. As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent, or give any personally identifiable information about you to any third party.

#### Information you supply

If you have started, but not completed, the registration process, we may send you email messages encouraging you to complete the process and become a subscriber.

If you would rather not receive emails about new products, promotions or other noteworthy news, you may opt-out by visiting the "Settings" section. We further offer a subscriber-based service to users seeking partners. To process subscriptions we may require your name, billing address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Credit card transactions are processed through a third party billing company, which only uses your information for that purpose.
