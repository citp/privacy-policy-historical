By using the Website in any way, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, whether or not you register as a member to the Service. We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.

As a matter of policy, we do not sell, rent, or give any personally identifiable information about you to any third party.</p><h4>Information you supply</h4><p>If you have started, but not completed, the registration process, we may send you email messages encouraging you to complete the process and become a subscriber. Once you complete the registration process, we may also occasionally send you newsletters and email you notifications of special events or information on users that are establishing contact with you through our site. If you would rather not receive emails about new products, promotions or other noteworthy news, you may opt-out by visiting the "Settings" section. We further offer a subscriber-based service to users seeking partners. To process subscriptions we may require your name, billing address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Credit card transactions are processed through a third party billing company, which only uses your information for that purpose.
