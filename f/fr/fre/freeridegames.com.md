  2. The Information We Collect:  

    * Generally, we do not collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") without specific permission from you. However, we may require that you provide us with certain PII, such as your email address, as a condition for you accessing and/or using certain parts of the Site, including downloading of the software upon which the Site is run (the "Software"). If you choose to do so, such PII may be collected by, and/or transferred to, any third party service providers and advertising companies and Exent's customers (collectively - "the Companies", and each - a "Company"). In any event, we will not knowingly collect any PII from children 13 years old and under. For any inquiries concerning collected PII please address: Exent Technologies Inc., 685 Market Street, Suite 450, San Francisco, Email: support@freeridegames.com. Should you become aware of any material inaccuracy in collected PII, please send a detailed notification thereof to: support@freeridegames.com, specifying the accurate information.
    * Each of the Companies may gather certain non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII") about you and/or your usage of the Site, the Service and/or any part thereof, including the pages you visit on the Site, advertisements seen in any third party software application ("Application"), any progress you made in any game and/or other applications, zip code, age etc. The Non-PII gathered and tracked will not be used by the Companies to attempt to identify you personally. Exent and/or any of the Companies may, however, use it for effective advertising on the Site and/or on any of the Applications. If you would like more information about this practice, and to know your choices about not having the Non-PII used by the Companies, click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).
    * Each of the Companies may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on their behalf, such as technical support services. To perform those functions, it may be necessary for them to obtain access to each of the Companies' databases and servers, which may contain PII about users.
    * Information about the advertisements you watch, on the Site and/or on any Application, may also be collected. For every advertisement you view while using an Application the Software transmits and stores the following information from your computer: Your IP Address, which may include a domain name; the name of the game in which the advertisement appeared; the location, size, display time and display duration of the advertisement in the game; other information about the advertisements and about the game session; and the date and time the above information is logged.
    * To enhance your experience with our Site, our web pages may use "cookies", which are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us. However, once you choose to furnish PII, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand Site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Site.
    * Collection and Use of registration and usage Information: Each of the Companies will collect data regarding the Applications you use, how long you use them and in which ways you use them (collectively, your "Usage Information").

    * Invite a Friend: If you choose to use our referral "Invite a Friend" service to tell a friend about the Site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will then send your friend a single invitation, by email (to the email address you provided us with), inviting him or her to visit the Site. We store said information (but do not share it with a third party) solely for the purposes of sending said one-time invitation by email and of tracking the success of our referral program. However, pursuant to your friend's request we may later send him or her additional notices, such as our periodic newsletter.
