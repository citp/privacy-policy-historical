**Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties**

**User Generated Content:** This site may offer visitors the option to participate in blogs or other interactive features and submit or post ratings, reviews, comments, videos, photographs, and other user-generated content ("User Material"). Such activities are subject to our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/about-us/legal/terms-of-use/ "Terms of use") and community policies. When you submit or post User Material, any personally identifiable information provided by you may be visible to other users or visitors. If you voluntarily post your e-mail address or contact information at this Site, you may receive unsolicited communications from third parties. Your participation in these features and your sharing of your personally identifiable information with us constitutes your agreement to such sharing. Fresh & Easy will not be responsible for the use or security of any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily provide.

**Sharing with Third Parties:** We do not share or sell personally identifiable information with or to third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. Your information is available only to us and to carefully selected agents, vendors, and services providers who help make this Site and our products and services available to you and fulfill your requests and orders, absent exceptional circumstances. We use third party agents to process credit card payments and to transmit e-mail communications to you. We may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties if you request or authorize it or to perform other functions on our behalf, such as analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, and administering our Rewards Program, contests and sweepstakes. In accordance with California law, we do not sell or share a Rewards Program member's name, address, telephone number, or other personal identification information with the limited exception of providing names and addresses of cardholders to a third party for purposes of mailing supermarket club card information to cardholders on our behalf. These third parties are contractually prohibited from using the information for any other purposes.

**Exceptional Circumstances:** If Fresh & Easy, or any of its lines of businesses or affiliated companies, is sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, the relevant databases of Fresh & Easy could, in whole or in part, be sold as part of that transaction. Therefore, information about our users, including personally identifiable information, will be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Sites, or sale or pledge of our company assets as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. Information about our users, including personally identifiable information, may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where Fresh & Easy, or an affiliate, is seeking financing, investment, support or funding. In such transactions, personally identifiable information will be subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained. We also may have to release personally identifiable information when it is necessary to comply with laws, to comply with judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders, or legal requests, to enforce our Terms and Conditions, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Fresh & Easy or others.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We employ reasonable security measures to protect your personally identifiable information and prevent unauthorized access. We also use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that our third party agents who make this Site and our services available and fulfill your orders agree to protect your information and honor your preferences about contacts you receive. When you make purchases online at the Site using a credit card, your credit card information is securely sent to and processed by a third party service provider, who stores the information on its servers. We do not store your credit card information on our servers. Keep in mind however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

**Other Web Sites; Social Plugins**

This Site may contain links to other websites and services owned by third parties, outside our control, and not covered by this Privacy Policy. Fresh & Easy is not responsible for such content. If you access another site or services using the links provided, the operators of those sites and services may collect information from you that will be used by them in accordance with their own privacy policy, which may differ from ours. Your use of any linked site is subject to the privacy policy imposed by the operator of the linked site, and Fresh & Easy disclaims all liability in connection with your use of a linked site.

Some of the Sites offer you the ability to interact with social plugins from social networks, including Facebook (facebook.com), Google + (plus.google.com), Twitter (twitter.com), and Pinterest (pinterest.com). When you interact with social network plugins on our Sites, your browser establishes a direct connection to the social network site, and the third party site transfers the plugin content to your browser, which enables the site to receive and store information about your access to our Sites. Your use of social network plugins is subject to each network's privacy policy, which may be different from ours, so we encourage you to read them. We have no control over the information that is collected, stored, and used by social network plugins.

Fresh & Easy reserves the right, in its complete discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will take effect upon posting, provided that the use of any information previously collected by Fresh & Easy will continue to be governed by the policy in effect when the information was collected. By using our Site or services following the posting of changes this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to consent to our then-current Privacy Policy. We will use information previously obtained in accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect when the information was obtained from you.
