Applications Sales

Application subscriptions will be billed on a monthly cycle. All first time Application(s) purchases are given a 7-day trial, starting with the day of purchase, to test the Application(s) or uninstall the Application(s) at no charge. Users will be billed for the first month’s subscription after the 7-day trial ends and then automatically billed for all subsequent months. The first billing date will set the timeline for all recurring billing payment. User will be automatically billed on the same date every following month. Please see examples below for more information.

Ex. 1

A user first purchases a $10.00 Application on 9/17/2011. User is given a 7-day trial period because the Application is purchased for the first time. The first billing will occur on 9/24/2011, 7 days after the first date of purchase. User will be billed $10.00 again the following month on 10/24/2011 and then again on 11/24/2011, etc.

User may uninstall the Application during the 7-trial without being charge. No refund will be given once user has paid for an application unless the Application(s) has a significant error. Please see our Refund Policy for further information. Multiple Applications purchased on the same day will be billed together.

If User had decided to uninstall a paid Application and then renew it later on, no 7-day trial period will be given. Trial period are only for first time purchases. Renewed subscription(s) will be billed on first day of purchase and then automatically billed again every following month. Freedcamp will only store saved information on uninstall Application up to 60 days. It is the user’s responsibility to renew their Applications before 60-day period in order to retrieve all stored data.

### Storage Sales

Users may upgrade or purchase additional storage by clicking on the “Upgrade Storage” link located at the top right corner or through Marketplace. Freedcamp offers 5 level of Storage Plans: Basic 1.00GB, More 5.00GB, Plus 10.00GB, Premium 15.00GB, and Unlimited. Each plan will have a set monthly subscription payment. Users will be billed for storage immediately upon purchase and will be billed again on the same date for all following months. If users first purchased a Basic Plan($2.50/GB) and decided to upgrade to a More Plan($7.99/GB), users will be billed the prorated amount for the More plan. The prorated amount is determined by difference in price and remaining time before the next billing date. Upon receipt of payment, user will immediately see an increase in their storage capacity. Users will then be billed the new Storage Plan amount on the next billing date. If users decides to downgrade from a More Plan to a Basic Plan, users will be automatically refunded the prorated amount. The storage amount will be immediately reduced and user will be billed the new lower Storage Plan price on the next billing date. Users may not mix or combine different Storage Plans. Freedcamp only offers fixed storage updates, therefore Users will have to choose one specific plan.

You agree to pay for all products purchased through Freedcamp’s Marketplace. Freedcamp, may charge your account automatically every month for the continual use of the application. Any nonpayment by the User will result in the expiration and unavailability of application(s) until payment resumes. (Please see Freedcamp’s Rights for further detail regarding nonpayment). YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING FREEDCAMP WITH A VALID CREDIT/DEBIT CARD OR PAYPAL ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. All monthly fees will be billed to the credit/debit card or PayPal account you designated during the registration process.

It is your responsibility to stop the monthly payments if you no longer wish to use the applications. You may contact Freedcamp through our Contact Links regarding any payment changes.

Your total price will be the cost of the applications, plus any applicable fees and sales tax. We will only charge sales tax in states where digital goods are taxable.

REFUND and CANCELLATION POLICY

Freedcamp will not offer a full refund unless major problems and bugs exist within our applications and are not fixed in a timely manner. It is your responsibility to inform Freedcamp of any application errors. Users are given 7-days after the original date of purchase to cancel any new applications subscription without being charge. After the    7-days period, refunds will only be permitted due to technical errors of the applications. User may submit a request for refund by stating out the appropriate grounds for a refund. Freedcamp will consider each individual refund request but is not obligated to grant User(s) a refund just based on the submission of a request. YOU MAY NOT REQUEST A REFUND IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED THE APPLICATIONS FOR OVER 2 WEEKS AFTER MAKING PAYMENT. Freedcamp does not offer refunds for storage payments.

Freedcamp’s billing system requires Users to pay for the Application up front therefore User must cancel the Application subscription(s) before the next billing cycle date in order to avoid the automatic recurring charges. If user cancels subscription at any time before the next billing cycle, user will still be able to use the Application until the next billing cycle date. See example below for further information.

  1. Close accounts and request alternative forms of payments if current forms of payment is fraudulently obtained or used on Freedcamp’s Marketplace.
  2. Cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates the Terms of Sales, or we believe doing so may prevent financial loss.
  3. If billing error occurs, on date of billing, due to:



·          credit/debit card decline,

·          misrepresented financial information,

User will be immediately notified via email of payment error on date of billing. User will then have 24 hours to make payment. If no payment is received after 24 hours, user will receive a second notice regarding payment error and another 24 hours to make prompt payment. If payment is still not received after the second notice, Freedcamp reserves the right to stop all functionality of any unpaid Application until payment is received. Any stored Application data will be saved for 60 days after the expiration period. If User eventually resumes payment within those 60 days, all saved Application data will be restored. If no payment is received during the 60 day, all Application data will be deleted.  It is the User’s responsibility to meet all financial obligations and make prompt payments within the set time period. Late payment made between the first and second notice time limit will not alter the billing date for the following months. Renewed subscription payments made after an Application has been suspended will set a new billing date and User will be automatically billed on the new payment date for all following months. Please see examples below.

Ex. 3.

User first purchases a $10.00 Application on 9/17/2011. User is given a 7-day trial period and then billed on 9/24/2011. The next billing date will occur on 10/24/2011.

If User finally makes a payment on 10/26/2011, User will still be able to use the Application and will be billed again on 11/24/2011.

If User fails to make payment at all after the second notice has been sent, Freedcamp will stop all functionality of the Application until payment is received. If User paid on 10/28/2011, Freedcamp will resume the functionality of the Application and the next billing date will now be on 11/28/2011 instead.
