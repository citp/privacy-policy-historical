The operations of Freedcamp does require our employees to have access to systems which store and process User Data. This primarily serves the purpose of problem diagnostic or troubleshooting. For example, in order to diagnose a problem Users may have with Freedcamp services, our Employees may need access to your User Data. All employees are prohibited from viewing User Data for any reasons unless absolutely necessary to do so. 

When Users delete their account(s) there are different scenarios how data deletion will be treated as described below:

  1. If you were not invited to any other projects owned by other Freedcamp User then your data can no longer be accessed by you or any other Users that you invited to Freedcamp. Complete data deletion will occur post 90 days. Please see “Data Retention” below for additional details regarding 90-days data retention.
  2. If User does not own projects and was only invited to other Freedcamp User’s projects then your specific contribution in other the projects will remain, but your personal information will be deleted. Freedcamp will make every effort to mask any personal information remaining, for example, your contribution to someone else’s project will be listed as “First Name, Last Initial” with no connection to your deleted personal information such as email, phone numbers, etc.
  3. If you own projects and were participating in other Users’ projects, then Freedcamp’s Data Deletion and Data Retention will apply to each category described in section (1) and (2) above.



Users, at any time, may request a deletion of their personal data. If such request is made, data are deleted based on points 1, 2, or 3 as noted above and will remain in backups and life-cycle we maintain to ensures we do not store data inside backups more than 90 days. Users may email _legal@freedcamp.com_ to request data deletion. However, if Users requires deletion of their data, we strongly suggest Users delete their account as this will help initiate the process as stated in points 1, 2 and 3 above. 

IF Users fail to make payment for any premium plans, Freedcamp will remove all paid features and return Users to the Free Plan. Please see section 7.5 of our ToS for User inactivity under the Free Plan. If Freedcamp deletes an account due to inactivity, the above scenarios will apply.

## Information storage and security

Freedcamp uses data hosting service providers in the United States to host collected information, and we use technical measures to secure all data. Despite the thorough security measures and safeguards that Freedcamp implements to protect data, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, Freedcamp cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. Freedcamp has policies in place in case of such situation and will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe. Freedcamp also provides Enterprise customers who selected 'private cloud' option to host their isolated and branded Freedcamp environment in any region supported by Amazon Web Services. Please contact _sales@freedcamp.com_ for more information.

## How long we keep information

How long we keep the information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will make every effort to delete your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

  * User Account information: We retain User information until User delete their account(s), which then we will continue retaining the data for up to 90 days after account deletion. Freedcamp maintains this practice due to the following reason:
    * In the event that User’s account has been compromised and purposely deleted. Freedcamp will help maintain and restore data once the situation is rectified
    * An account was mistakenly deleted by Users. In such an event, Freedcamp will be able to restore data for Users.
    * Various data storage systems and backups have different lifecycle policies which are held for a maximum of 90 days. For example, our database backups are encrypted, incremental and full re-cycle in 30 days. It is impossible to erase User data inside up to 1 minute precision encrypted incremental backups.
    * If User initially canceled their account and requested but later change their mind. A user will be able to have all data restored if an account is reactivated within 90 days after initial account cancellation. 
    * Freedcamp may also retain some of the User data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies any specific Users, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about any Users.  
 
  * The information you share on the Services: If User’s account is deactivated or disabled, some of the User information and the content that Users have provided will remain in order to allow other Project members or other Users to make full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display comments and content you provided to boards or cards. Freedcamp will hold User data up to 90 days after account cancellation in case Users will renew again within that time frame.  
 
  * Marketing and Promotional information: If Users have elected and provided consent to receive marketing and promotional emails from Freedcamp, we retain information about Users' marketing preferences unless asked specifically to delete such information. Freedcamp retains information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.



We take the security of your data very seriously at Freedcamp. As transparency is one of the principles on which our company is built, we aim to be as clear and open as we can about the way we handle security. Our security practices are [published here](https://freedcamp.com/Freedcamp_LxR/Freedcamp_Devel_yOf/wiki/wiki_public/view/SOcab).

Freedcamp does not allow the use of our Services or Sites to anyone younger than 16 years old unless Consent is provided in writing by a legal guardian. Freedcamp will make the utmost effort to prohibit the use of our Site by anyone not over the legal age. Should Freedcamp learn that anyone under 16 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, Freedcamp will take the necessary steps to delete such information. 

Freedcamp has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do make changes, we will post a notification on the main page of our Site and send you an email. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.
