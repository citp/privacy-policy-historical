5.     **Informing You**

We may communicate with our customers on a regular basis via e-mail and/or mail to provide requested services, resolve any complaints and for general customer service, and by other means where applicable, such as to investigate any suspicious transactions. You may receive occasional service announcements and administrative messages, for example, advance notice of any maintenance that might affect the Site. Generally, you cannot opt out of these types of "informational" rather than "promotional" communications.

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files and graphic files to create a profile of our customers. We also purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing customer database so we can better provide pertinent offers in which you might be interested.

9.     **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Updates. This Privacy Policy will be periodically updated to reflect changes in laws, regulations, and their interpretation, and, therefore, we reserve the right to change, modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any revised Privacy Policy will only apply prospectively to your personally identifiable information collected or modified after the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy. You should periodically check this Privacy Policy so you can always be aware of what information is collected, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, FreeSportsBet.com discloses it. Dispute Resolution. You and FreeSportsBet.com agree that any Dispute between you and FreeSportsBet.com shall be resolved exclusively and finally by arbitration administered by the National Arbitration Forum ("NAF"), using interpretations under Colorado law, and conducted under its rules, except as otherwise provided below. You and FreeSportsBet.com will agree on another arbitration forum if NAF ceases operations. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator, and will be limited solely to the Dispute between you and FreeSportsBet.com. The arbitration, or any portion of it, will not be consolidated with any other arbitration and will not be conducted on a class-wide or class action basis. The arbitration shall be held at any reasonable location in Denver, Colorado. If you prevail in the arbitration of any Dispute with FreeSportsBet.com, FreeSportsBet.com will reimburse you for any fees you paid to NAF in connection with the arbitration. Any decision rendered in such arbitration proceedings will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court of competent jurisdiction. Should either party bring a Dispute in a forum other than NAF, the arbitrator may award the other party its reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in staying or dismissing such other proceedings or in otherwise enforcing compliance with this dispute resolution provision. You understand that, in the absence of this provision, you would have had a right to litigate disputes through a court, including the right to litigate claims on a class-wide or class action basis, and that you have expressly and knowingly waived those rights and agreed to resolve any Disputes through binding arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. This arbitration provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. For the purposes of this provision, the term "Dispute" means any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to: (i) this Privacy Policy, its interpretation, or the breach, termination, applicability or validity thereof; (ii) the related order for, purchase, delivery, receipt or use of any product or service from FreeSportsBet.com; or iii) any other dispute arising out of or relating to the relationship between you and FreeSportsBet.com; the term "FreeSportsBet.com" means FreeSportsBet.com, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, beneficiaries, agents, assigns, component suppliers (both hardware and software), and/or any third party who provides products or services purchased from or distributed by FreeSportsBet.com.
