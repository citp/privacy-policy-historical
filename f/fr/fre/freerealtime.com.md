## _FreeRealTime.com Privacy Policy_

FreeRealTime.com respects your privacy. This statement of our Privacy Policy explains what information we gather from you and how we use that information. We consider the information you have shared with us strictly confidential and will use that information only as specified in this Privacy Policy or to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law. 

## Information We Gather and How We Use It

We collect certain information from you in order to provide you with the most interesting and useful Web site possible. 

We use your IP address to identify you, to gather demographic information that helps us understand how you and our other customers use our Web site, and to administer our Web site. If you purchase items through the MarketPlace, your IP address is used to help match you with your shopping cart. 

Our registration form requires you to give us contact information (like your name and email address), demographic information (like your zip code, age, occupation and income level) and profile information (like your investment experience). We use your contact information to contact you about our Web site and provide you with information and promotional material from our partners and advertisers. We use various other portions of your information to comply with New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market regulations regarding the distribution of real-time information, to target advertising, and to personalize our Web site by showing you content that we think you might be interested in and displaying the content according to your preferences. 

We sometimes conduct or sponsor surveys and contests on our Web site. If you elect to participate, we may ask you for contact, demographic and other information as part of these offerings. We would use this information to analyze and report on the results of surveys, to provide you with the results of the surveys and contests, and to send you information about our company and promotional material from our partners and advertisers. Participation in surveys and contests is completely voluntary. 

From time to time we may supplement information that you provide to us with information received from third parties. 

## Information We May Disclose

We share demographic, profile and other general information about you and our other customers with our advertisers on an aggregate basis. This means that we tell our advertisers general information about the characteristics of our customer base such as how many female visitors and registered users we have within a certain postal code, but we do not specifically identify a particular female visitor or provide her contact information to our advertisers. 

Our advertisers may ask us to mail or e-mail you promotional information tailored to your interests. We will send you this information on behalf of our advertisers. From time to time we may use third parties (pursuant to a confidentiality agreement) to assist us in e-mail broadcasts and list management. You may opt-out of receiving these mailings as explained below under the heading “Your Options.” 

We may disclose your contact information or other specific information about you to third parties in conjunction with advertising, contests or new service offerings that you elect to participate in. 

We may share your contact information with our strategic partners and certain other companies. These selected entities may send you information by e-mail or regular mail, or may contact you by telephone. 

We may from time to time sell or transfer your contact and demographic information to affiliates and non-affiliates of the Company. 

As we continually look for ways to improve our business, we may buy or sell a company. If we buy or sell a business, the names collected will likely be transferred as a part of the sale. Information about registrants will be used in the aggregate. However, if we buy a business, we will honor the requests that customers made of that business regarding e-mail communications. In the event that we sell a business, we will do everything in our power to ensure that the e-mail communications requests you made of us are honored. 

We may release your contact and other information to third parties when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) cooperate with state and federal regulatory agency investigations, (iii) comply with the terms of the Subscriber Agreements with Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, (iv) enforce the terms of our User Agreement or License Agreement, or (v) protect the rights of FreeRealTime.com or others.
