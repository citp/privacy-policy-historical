##### Cookies:

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on our sites. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

We use session ID and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. 

We set a persistent cookie to store your preferences so that each time you visit the site you do not have to set your search preferences more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

The use of cookies by our third party partners or affiliates is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners and affiliates use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and provide search results based on your preferences. 

##### Targeted or Behavioral Advertising:

Targeted advertising (also known as Behavioral Advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which pch.com advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than FreeEducationGuide.com. For example, if you have shown a preference for nursing while visiting FreeEducationGuide.com, you may be served an advertisement from FreeEducationGuide.com for nursing related programs when you visit a site other than FreeEducationGuide.com. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from FreeEducationGuide.com or through third party website publishers. If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising from FreeEducationGuide.com that occurs when visiting our third party advertising publishers, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from FreeEducationGuide.com and any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you will continue to receive online advertising from FreeEducationGuide.com; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you. 

##### Links to Third Party Sites:

If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the FreeEducationGuide.com site you are visiting and be redirected to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as FreeEducationGuide.com. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party Web site that is linked to a FreeEducationGuide.com site, you should read that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information. 

Third-party marketing vendors, including Google, may show FreeEducationGuide.com ads on sites on the internet and may use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to FreeEducationGuide.com. Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page [http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/).
