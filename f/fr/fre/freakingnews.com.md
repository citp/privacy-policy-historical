**Privacy Policy**

Freaking News does not require account registrations to visit our site and browse our galleries. If you are just a visitor and not a member, we do not collect or store any of your personal information. 

**Registrations and Personal data:**  
If you decide to participate in our contests, forums, or leave feedback on entries, you will need to [register](https://web.archive.org/register.asp) a free account with us. Freaking News will not sell, or share your personal data to any third parties. The only exception to this rule is if we get a legal subpoena, however this is very unlikely as we never got even a single legal subpoena for any of our members within the 11 years of operations. Your true email and IP will never be displayed on the site - other users and visitors will only see your username. 

**Username and Password Recommendations**  
We always suggest that you choose the username you like and stick with it. However, if, for any reason, you would like to change your username, you can contact us and we will change it for you (subject to availability of the new new username). Please note that your new username will retroactively show on all your past entries and comments too. 

Please make sure your password is at least 6 characters long and includes letters and numbers. Try to choose a password that is sophisticated enough, yet is not hard for you to remember. If you forget your password, you can retrieve it [here](https://web.archive.org/error.asp?failure=password), and following the steps on the page. Then check your email box, and make sure to check your Spam mail folder too, in case our message gets filtered there. 

**Cookies**  
Google uses cookies to serve ads on Freaking News. You may opt out of Google cookies by visiting the [Google advertising policy](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/) and [Google privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). 

**Questions?**  
Please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/message.asp?uid=2).
