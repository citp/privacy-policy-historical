We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your Web browser, including your Internet Protocol (“ **IP address** ”), the page you request, and how long and how often you visit any page on our Website. When you use our Website, our servers log certain information that your Web browser sends when you visit any Web site. Our server logs may include information such as your Web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

We allow third-party advertisers to serve advertisements on our Website. These third-party advertisers use technology that sends advertisements and links directly to your browser, and they automatically receive your IP address when this happens. We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party advertisers without your consent, except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. If you respond to an advertisement, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience the advertiser is trying to reach. The advertiser may also use non-personally identifiable information regarding your use of our Website, such as the number of times you viewed an ad, to determine which ads to deliver to you.

We use cookies on our Website. Cookies are small chunks of data created by a web server, delivered through a Web browser, and stored on your computer.

We serve a cookie from our Web site when members log in to member-only pages, so that they can navigate those pages on the site. A randomly-generated anonymous identifier is assigned to that cookie to enable this process. We also serve a cookie to note the anonymous web traffic described in this section of this Privacy Policy.
