            <p><strong>Information Collected by &nbsp;FREEPOSTIA</strong><br>
              We only  collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website and  to control users uploading and sharing unnapropiate content.<br>
            This  information allows us to avoid and fight unnapropiate content. We do not  process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective.</p>
<p>We collect  the following types of information from our &nbsp;FREEPOSTIA users:</p>
            <p><strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong></p>
            <p>Registration:  In order for you to use &nbsp;FREEPOSTIA services,  such as uploading images and keep track of the clicks, galleries and image  editing, you must complete a registration form.

            <p><strong>Automatic Information:</strong></p>
<p>We receive  and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. &nbsp;FREEPOSTIA and its authorized agents  automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their  server logs from your browser including your IP address and the page you  requested. &nbsp;FREEPOSTIA uses this traffic  data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends, administer the  website and avoid use of innapropiate content.</p>
            <p><strong>E-mail Communications</strong><br>
              FREEPOSTIA is very concerned about your  privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party. </p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
              Cookies are  alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through  your Web browser to enable our systems to set the language that you want to use  and to keep sessions while you use our site.<br>

We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies  allow you to use some of our coolest features.<br>
              Some of our  business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We  have no access to, or control over, these cookies.</p>
            <p><strong>Sharing Your Information</strong><br>
