If you feel that we are not abiding by our posted privacy policy, please contact Camille Chevalier at [camille@frenchtoday.com](http://www.frenchtoday.com/learn-french/contact-us) or call (+33) 09 72 14 76 68

#### Information Collection and Use

French Today is the sole owner of the order information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others. French Today collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

#### How do we use "cookies"?

"Cookies" are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not contain personally identifying information. Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies; you can usually change your browser settings to refuse cookies.

We use cookies to enhance your experience of our site, to allow you to navigate quickly, and to keep track of items when you shop on-line. Cookies are not used on our site to store your account information; this information is stored securely on the site's server. When you log in at the site with your username and password or make a purchase, we will assign you a secure session id. The server then passes your information to you through this secure session id. Also, we will use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of our site.

We also use cookies to track the identity of the Web site you visited immediately prior to visiting our site. Otherwise, we will not track information about your use of other Web sites.

#### Free French Today Newsletter

In order to receive your free French Today newsletter, we request that you submit your email address and zip code or country which is automatically placed on the Free Online Newsletter list operated by Mailchimp.com for French Today. This information is used to send your free newsletter. The zip code or country may be used to send specific information pertinent to your area, state or country. French Today does not share, sell or give your Email address to anyone. Those on the newsletter list may also be sent information pertaining to the release of the latest French Today products or current promotions/news.

#### Orders

We request information from the users on our web store order form. Here a user must provide contact information including name, address, phone, email, shipping address, credit card number and expiration date. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

#### Credit Card Numbers

All credit card processing is done via our payment gateway Paypal.com. Your credit card number is never stored or even sent to French Today and Paypal encrypts as soon as you enter it into their system. Your credit card number remains encrypted at all times.

#### Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number-see above) that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing". To learn more about SSL, follow this link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

#### Kid's policy (individuals under 13 years of age)

French Today is committed to protecting the safety of children online. In compliance with the Children's Privacy Protection Act of 1998, French Today will never knowingly request or use personal information from children under 13 years of age without prior parental consent. If French Today receives actual knowledge that a subscriber is under 13 years of age, French Today will eliminate all personal information relating to this subscriber from our files.

#### Correction/Updating Personal Information

Our system is set up to allow each user to make corrections to his or her contact information. If your contact information has changed, please make corrections by going to the link marked your account at the top of each page in the web store (www.frenchtoday.com/store). If you have any problems with this, or would like to be removed from our list, please contact us at [camille@frenchtoday.com](http://www.frenchtoday.com/learn-french/contact-us) or by calling (+33) 09 72 14 76 68, or by sending a letter to our mailing address:
