You don’t have to give us any of this personal information but if you don’t, you may not be able to buy from the site, and you are unlikely to receive our optimal overall customer experience.  But that is your choice – and we respect that. We also anonymize  
and aggregate personal information (so that it does not identify you) and use it for purposes including testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving our site and app, and developing new products and services. We also share this information  
with some third parties that help us make sense of this data (with reports, analytics, etc..).

## Sharing your information

We do not, and will not, sell _any_ of your personal data to _any_ third party – including your name, address, email address or credit card information (which we do not keep anyway). We want to earn and maintain your trust, and we believe this is absolutely essential in order do that. We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain technical data analysis, processing and/or storage offerings. These service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection and security standards. We only share information with them that is required for the services offered and we contractually bind them to keep any information we share with them as confidential and to process Personal Data only according to our instructions.

We might share your data with the following categories of companies as an essential part of being able to provide our services to you, as set out in this statement:

  1. Companies that do things to get your purchases to you, such as payment service providers, download storage companies
  2. Professional service providers, such as marketing agencies, advertising partners and website hosts, who help us run our business
  3. Credit reference agencies, law enforcement, and fraud prevention agencies, so we can help tackle fraud



We may provide third parties with aggregated but anonymized information and analytics about our customers and, before we do so, we will make sure that it does not identify you.

## Marketing messages

If you have said we can, we’ll send you marketing messages by email or via our app to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you see and find our products.

**How to stop marketing messages from French Today**

You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time. You can do this:

  1. By clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of any marketing email
  2. By contacting our support – support@frenchtoday.com



Once you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you don’t receive further marketing messages. Please note that, as French Today comprises several inter-connecting services, it might take a few days for all our systems to be updated, so you might get messages from us while we process your request. Stopping marketing messages will not stop critical service communications (such as order updates or where you have expressed an interest in an activity at French Today)

## Seeing adverts for French Today online

We also engage in online advertising, also to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you see and find our products. Like many companies, we might target French Today banners and ads to you when you are on other websites and apps. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook’s Custom Audience service. The banners and ads you see will be based on information we hold about you, or your previous use of French Today (for example the content you read on French Today) or on French Today banners or ads you have previously clicked on.

## Your information and countries outside Europe

Even though we are physically located in France, our website hosting and many of the download and marketing services we use are based in the USA. The USA is not a country in respect of which there is a European Commission decision of adequacy, and  
we protect your privacy and your rights through the use of the European Commission’s standard data protection clauses. More information about these is available here  
[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087)

## Keeping your information

We’ll hold on to your information for as long as you have your account, or as long as is needed to be able to provide the services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Care team) for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only. If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions, we may also keep hold of some of your information as required, even after you have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.

## Your rights

You have a lot of rights relating to your personal information:

  1. The right to be informed about how your personal information is being used (like this notice)
  2. The right to access the personal information we hold about you
  3. The right to request the correction of inaccurate personal information we hold about you (although you can probably do most of this through your account panel if you are a customer)
  4. The right to request that we delete your data, or stop processing it or collecting it, in some circumstances
  5. The right to stop direct marketing messages, which you can do by unsubscribing to our emails via the unsubscribe link at the bottom and to withdraw consent for other consent-based processing at any time
  6. The right to request that we transfer or port elements of your data either to you or another service provider
  7. The right to complain to your data protection regulator



If you want to exercise your rights, have a complaint, or just have questions, please contact us via support@frenchtoday.com

We may change this page from time to time, to reflect how we are processing your data. If we make significant changes, we will make that clear on the French Today website or other French Today services, or by some other means of contact such as email, so that you are able to review the changes before you continue to use French Today.
