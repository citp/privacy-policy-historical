            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>The FreeBSD Project recognizes that your privacy and the
	protection of your personal information is important to you
	and is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy
	Policy describes the measures taken by us to protect your
	privacy in connection with your use of www.FreeBSD.org (our
	"Site").  This policy does not cover mirrors of this content
	on other hosts (the "Mirrors") or other FreeBSD-related services
	in the FreeBSD.org domain ("Affiliated Sites").</p>
            <p>This policy was last modified on October 19, 2012.</p>
            <p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.  BY USING THIS
	SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY.</p>
            <h2>What information is collected on our Site:</h2>
            <p>When you visit our Site we gather information regarding your
	use of our site, such as the pages you view and the time you
	view each page.  We also collect information such as your
	Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type and operating
	system information.   The foregoing information is
	collectively referred to below as "Your Usage Data."</p>
            <p>We store information such as your email address, name, and
	organization or company ("Personally Identifiable
	Information") only if you decide to send us such information
	by submitting a FreeBSD bug or problem report ("PR"), subscribing
	to one of the FreeBSD mailing lists or posting content to our
	Site forums.  The FreeBSD Project allows unlimited distribution
	of that content.   Information submitted in those reports and
	lists, including your Personally Identifiable Information, is
	considered public and will be accessible to anyone on the web.
	Such information is not only stored on servers belonging to
	the FreeBSD Foundation, but it is also stored on other servers
	that mirror the content of our Site.   The FreeBSD Foundation has
	no control over the use of that information, including your
	Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
            <p>This website uses a cookie to record layout style preferences
	for individual users, as well track anonymous traffic data.
	A cookie is a small text file provided by a web server that may
	be placed on your computer by your web browser.  Cookies cannot
	be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
	Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by

            <h2>How the information collected is used:</h2>
            <p>The FreeBSD Project takes the privacy of our users and members
	very seriously.  We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide
	your personally identifiable information to any third parties
	except as stated in this document.  We will not associate any
	data gathered from your use of our Site with any personally
	identifying information.</p>
            <p>The FreeBSD Project will not use or share your personal
	information in a manner that differs from what is described in
	this Privacy Policy without your prior consent.</p>
            <h2>How your information is protected:</h2>
            <p>The FreeBSD Project strictly protects the security of the
	personal information you provide.  Personal information we
	collect is stored in password-controlled servers with limited
	access, and we carefully protect this information from loss or
	misuse, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration,
	or destruction.</p>
            <h2>When your information may be disclosed:</h2>
            <p>The FreeBSD Project may disclose personal information if required
	to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is
	necessary to:</p>
            <ol><li>conform to the requirements of the law or comply with legal
	    process served on The FreeBSD Project or the Site;</li>

	  <li>protect and defend the rights or property of The FreeBSD Project;
	    or</li>

	    of The FreeBSD Project, its websites, or the public.</li></ol>
            <p>Anonymized aggregate traffic data about website visits may be shared
	for marketing or research purposes.</p>
            <p>The FreeBSD Project uses Google Analytics, a web analytics
	service provided by Google, Inc.   Google Analytics is a tool
	that enables the FreeBSD Project to see how visitors to our Site
	use our Site and how they arrive at our Site.   Google
	Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your
	computer, to help our Site to analyze visitor activity.   We
	send Google Analytics data that reports on your use of the
	Site.   That data includes Your Usage Data and is not
	anonymised before it is transmitted to Google Analytics.
	This un-anonymised data is stored by Google on servers, once
	it is transmitted to Google.   Google will use this
	information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the
	Site, compiling reports on website activity for website
	operators and providing other services relating to website
	activity and internet usage.   Google may also transfer Your
	Usage Data to third parties where required to do so by law, or
	where such third parties process the information on Google's
	behalf.  Google will not associate Your Usage Data with any
	other data held by Google.   You may refuse the use of cookies
	by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however
	please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the
	full functionality of our Site.  By using our Site, you
	consent to the processing of Your Usage Data by Google in the
	manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
            <p>With the exception of the transmission of Your Usage Data to
	Google for the sole purpose of using Google Analytics and the
	public access we permit to the bug reports you submit, the
	mailing lists you subscribe to, and posting content to our
	Site forums, the FreeBSD Project does not share un-anonymised
	data with anyone.</p>
            <h2>Updates to this privacy policy:</h2>
            <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy.  When we do, we
	will also revise the "last modified" date at the top of the Privacy
	Policy.  We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy
	to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information
