#### Personal data we receive from third parties

  * We collect information that users of the site, such as Guests, Members or Models provide about you in the course of the chat conversation or communication with our Billing and Support Team. 
  * The personal information we collect may also come from third parties, such as partners and service providers, to the site. These third parties assist us in maintaining data accuracy and providing and enhancing the services. We are also dealing with partner ad networks, which help us to promote Freestreamtv. For example, we might receive information about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks. 
  * We are also managing an ad network and promotional tools ourselves and may receive information about your experiences and interactions with our ads and promotional tools published/used on third party or affiliated sites. 



#### Personal data we collect from publically available sources

We collect publically available information about you only when it is necessary to prevent fraud and illegal activities on our site (for example, when we suspect that you are using a false or stolen credit card, when we witness child abuse cases, or pedophile activity, etc.).

This data may comprise publically available information you share on social media like Facebook, your blog and/or site, and any other public data available on the internet.

This information is always associated or combined with the data we collect through our site in order to finalize our investigation before reporting any fraud and illegal activities to authorities. We never use publically available data for any other purpose.

#### Special category of data

  * **Freestreamtv is an adult entertainment site and, due to the nature of our site and your activity, we may have data about you, which could reflect your sexual interests.**

When you create an account and freely indicate certain sexual preferences in order to give yourself more visibility and presence on our site, you provide us with certain information about your sexual life.

When you visit pages of Models on our site or when you watch live cam shows, we collect the category of the Models you watched or whose page you visited in order to provide you with the services you requested for and enhance your experience on the site. If you agreed to receive promotional emails from us, we will also send you special offers and news about our features based on your interests on our site.

Due to the explicit meaning of each category name, as well as the types of Models (e.g. Asian girls, White Ladies, Latin Women, etc… from whom you request services), it is possible that the chosen categories reflect your sexual orientation and give us indications about your sexual life.

We understand that this may not explicitly reflect information about your life outside of the site. It may only be a role you choose to play in the virtual environment. However, in order to provide you with the highest level of data protection, we treat this data as a special data category, which is highly protected.

  * **What are your choices regarding the collection and use of this special category of data?**

Because your sexual preferences and other data relating to your sexual life are essential aspects of privacy, we are maintaining very high IT security standards. We are periodically proceeding with controls and assessments of our security measures, in order to guarantee a trustworthy environment.

We will always ask you to agree to the use of this special category of data.

Please be aware that you can change your opinion regarding the global processing of your sensitive data in your consent settings at any time.

However, please note that refusing to provide or revoking your consent to have this data collected means that you will not be able to log into your account and use the services, as we will not be able to provide you with the services without such information.

In case you freely indicated your sexual preferences in your account settings, and you just want to delete this data, you can easily remove it from your profile in your account. This will not affect your use of the site.




### Why do we process your personal data?

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

#### Open your Member account and provide you with the services

Primarily, we use the personal data you give us when you create your account to open and administer your online account, to allow you to do a number of activities and to use features of our site. In addition, we use the information to allow you to purchase credits and benefit from paying and non-paying services.

Your account is also a way to exercise control over your personal data. In your account, you can manage your purchases, take advantage of special offers, and manage your account settings. You are in control of what you use to complete your profile, and can choose the information you wish to share with us.

We process this information given our legitimate interest in providing you the services you requested and creating your account.

If you fail to provide minimum details about you, the consequence will be that we will not be able to create an account and allow you to use our services.

In order to better understand what your needs are and how we can improve our services, we compile the information you gave to us or that we collected about you when visiting pages on our site or while using our services, to detect general trends regarding the preferences/habits of our users.

  * We have affiliate programs through which webmasters or other third parties can help us to promote our sites, for example by creating reproduction of our well-known sites. Those sites can include only certain categories of Models. We share some limited information about you with the webmasters or other third parties participating to our programs, in order to help them to setup, maintain and optimize their marketing campaigns or promotional activities. This also allows them to track their income. Please see point "With whom do we share your data?" to learn more.
  * Finally, please be aware that any information that you made public on our site, such as comments on the public wall of Models, may appear on search engines results, together with your username.

#### Payment and Accounting

  * Depending on the payment method you choose, we use your identification data and payment information to process transactions and maintain legally required accounting records.
  * We also use your data, if necessary, to investigate issues with the bank processing your payment or with a debt collector, in case of unpaid transactions, chargebacks or refunds.

#### With the Models

Your contract with us secures your ability to benefit from and purchase services relating to adult entertainment from Models.

  * Regarding your profile information, by default, the only data element visible to the Model is your username. However, you may choose to share with a Model other information about you that you added to "My Profile" in your account settings, like your gender, age, location, interests, etc…; you may also connect your camera in private chat in order to visually communicate with the Model or just turn on your microphone. The Model is not allowed to record the visuals you provide. In any case, please keep in mind that you can manage the visibility of the information you added in "My Profile" by selecting the appropriate option in your privacy settings and therefore decide who can see the information you put on your profile.
  * What else do we show about you to the Models?

    * We show them a special icon, if you subscribed to their fan club;
    * We show them a special icon, if you added them in your favorites;
    * We show them a special icon, if you are a regular Member on a site and already purchased a certain number of credits, so that they know that you deserve extra attention and a good service. Please be aware that you can deactivate this feature, by contacting us to the email address or address indicated in point "How to contact us?". 



#### With other users of the site and with the public

  * When you chat with a Model in a free chat, other users of our site can see your username and the messages you write.
  * If you added information about yourself to "My Profile", you may choose to disclose such information to other users, only to Models with whom you are in private chat or with no one, in your privacy settings. As indicated, please keep in mind that you can manage the visibility of the information you added in "My Profile" by selecting the appropriate option in your privacy settings and therefore decide who can see the information you put on your profile.
  * In addition, if you post comments on a Model’s wall, other users will see your comments.

You may receive transactional emails from this party confirming the order, including dispatch, possible refunds, and follow-up invitations to leave feedback for this party.

#### Right to object

  * We process your data for a variety of reasons as explained in "Why do we process your personal data?". Applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we will stop processing your personal data for these purposes.

In specific situations, we may have to refuse the execution of your request. This would be the case where we have legitimate grounds to continue such processing or if we have to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.

Please keep in mind that objecting to the use of your data might disable the use of your account.

  * Please note that you may, at any time, ask us to stop sending you marketing emails by opting-out in your account settings.



#### Right to restriction of processing

You have the right to request that we hold your personal data in "limbo", while other challenges are resolved.

Basically, you can ask us to put on hold the use of your data in 4 cases:

  * If you contest the fact that the personal data we hold about you is accurate: in this case, the processing operations in relation to this data will be put on hold for the period during which this is verified.
  * You have objected to a processing activity based on legitimate interest(s): in this case, you can require the processing operation to be put on hold while we verify the grounds for processing.
  * You consider that the processing is unlawful but you object to erasure and request restriction, instead.
  * We have no further need for the data but you require it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.



Despite your request, we may still continue the processing of your personal data if we have to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. We will notify you before lifting a restriction.

#### Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority

If you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR or any other applicable national laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, (in particular in the Member State where you live, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR).
