## Shhhhhhhh!

FreeLanguage.org does not share information with any third parties, not even for big bucks.

In the unlikely event that we are somehow required by The Man to disclose information about our users, we will contact you and let you know the specific details. No worries: we don't think this will happen.

You can feel safe, warm and fuzzy while browsing the site because we are never going to sell your information to any third party. Not even general information about who visits the site. And, above all, certainly not personal information about our users.
