# Privacy Policy - FreewareHome

## Privacy:

At **[Freeware Home](http://www.freewarehome.com/ "Visit Site")** we take the issue of privacy seriously. Our aim is to make your visits to our site safe and pleasurable.

**• Privacy**

**We** have no need to collect personal information therefore we make a point of neither asking for it, nor collecting it without your knowledge. We do ask for an e-mail address if you want a reply to any message you send using our contact page or if you post a comment and in either case want us to reply to you. **PLEASE NOTE:** your address is **not** stored, added to any list, address book, or anything and contact messages are **permanently deleted** as soon as a reply has been sent.

**• Parents...** To protect your children (and you!) we recommend that you do **not** allow them to use **your** e-mail address anywhere on the Internet. We suggest that you get them their own e-mail address from one of the free services, such as **[Yahoo!](http://mail.yahoo.com/ "Visit Site")** We also recommend that you help them pick their own **"net alias"** and encourage them to use it at all times instead of their own name.

**• Advertising:** Freeware Home works with third party agencies to serve ads to the site. Advertising is monitored for both content and graphic acceptability.

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.

To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website --> [Learn more](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/learn_more.asp "Visit Site")

**Important: As soon as you click on an ad you leave our website. From that point on neither we, nor any agency we use, has any control over the privacy practices of the advertiser. What happens on the advertiser's own website can be changed by them at any time, it is impossible to even monitor it!**

**• Safe Surfing:** We ask you to remember that we provide you with **LINKS** to a program author's home page. If you follow one of these links, you will go to a page over which **we** have no control. Even though we check out a site before putting the link on our pages, we cannot be responsible for other people's content. **Please be aware of where you are surfing.**
