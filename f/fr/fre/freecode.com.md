# SourceForge - Privacy

SourceForge, Inc. (”SourceForge“), comprised of the Internet sites SourceForge.com, Slashdot.org, SourceForge.net, freshmeat.net, ITmanagersJournal.com, Linux.com and NewsForge.com (the "Sites"), is committed to protecting the privacy of users of the Sites. At SourceForge, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information, including registration data. As part of the normal operation of the Sites, we collect information from you. With the exception of SourceForge.net, which has a separate privacy statement, the Privacy Statement set forth herein applies to each of the Sites and describes the information we collect about you and how that information may be used.i 

###  Information Gathered through the SourceForge Sites 

SourceForge will track the domains from which people visit the SourceForge Sites in order to gain aggregate data that may be analyzed for trends and statistics. Subject to the provisions of this Privacy Statement, SourceForge may use accumulated aggregate data for several purposes including, but not limited to, marketing analysis, evaluation of SourceForge's services, and business planning. 

SourceForge may conduct surveys or other studies of its user base and usage for marketing and planning purposes. Participation in such surveys is at the user's option, but SourceForge does reserve the right to conduct mandatory surveys in the future. With respect to information collected from such surveys or studies, and in the event that responses are to be publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey and SourceForge will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users and not personal information identifying any specific individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where SourceForge advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, SourceForge reserves the right to disclose text information provided by any user through such a survey, provided that no personal information identifying that user is disclosed.  Circumstances under which SourceForge would publicly disclose aggregate information include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the site population, providing data to SourceForge advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, business planning, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications. 

####  Cookies 

SourceForge employs "cookies" to provide users with tailored information. A "cookie" is an element of data that a web site, when visited by a user, sends to that user's browser which, in turn, may store that element on the user's hard drive or memory.  SourceForge uses cookies to better serve users of SourceForge Sites.  Any cookies sent by SourceForge will be marked so that they will be accessible only by SourceForge Sites subject to this Privacy Statement. However, at the user’s option and at the user’s sole expense and responsibility, any user may block or delete SourceForge cookies from the user’s hard drive or memory. However, by disabling cookies, certain site features and functionality may no longer work properly, or at all. 

####  Other Notification 

In order to implement or enforce the Terms, SourceForge may use user-provided email addresses to contact users on an individual basis.  At no time, unless such disclosure is required by law, a governmental agency, or specifically authorized by the user, will SourceForge disclose individual user personal information to unrelated third parties that is not publicly available. 

###  Links with other sites 

The SourceForge Sites contain links to other websites, whether owned or controlled by SourceForge affiliates, or unrelated third parties. Please note that the privacy policies of these sites may differ from those of the SourceForge Sites. SourceForge is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any linked website. We encourage you to read the privacy statement of any web site you may visit. 

###  Choice 

####  "Opt-in" Emails 

Users may "opt-in" to receive site notifications, newsletters, or other information via email. Users may remove themselves from such services at their discretion. Any email sent to an "opt-in" list will include directions for how a user may remove himself or herself from the list, or a URL where the user may find such directions. 

####  Profile Display 

In some cases, a user’s personal information may be publicly available through such user's profile display. In such cases, users have the option to opt out of publicly displaying their personal information, including email addresses.  Users may also enlist this technique when posing comments on certain SourceForge Sites.  In cases where site profiles allow users to display optional information publicly, such entry and display is at the user's discretion and may be changed at any time by the user. 

####  Email Display 

In some cases, users may have the opportunity to use an SourceForge Site to send electronic mail to another user or email list. In such cases, a user's valid email address and real name will be included with such messages. In order to prevent abuse, users may not opt-out of such a display, but may choose to refrain from using such SourceForge Site to transmit an email message. 

###  Access 

On certain SourceForge Sites, users can view their data on their personal profile page. When technically feasible, users are permitted to update their personal information directly through SourceForge. When such updating service is not technically feasible, SourceForge will make reasonable efforts to assist users in updating their personal information. 

###  Security 

To secure site integrity, SourceForge employs measures, including but not limited to security audits, use of encryption tools and software, and other reasonable security measures and procedures. 

Internal access to users' private and nonpublic personal information is restricted to site administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis. 

###  Enforcement 

In the event that SourceForge becomes aware that site security is compromised or nonpublic user information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to external security attacks, SourceForge shall take reasonable measures which it deems appropriate, including but not limited to internal investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities, notwithstanding other provisions of this Privacy Statement. 

If SourceForge becomes aware that a user's personal information provided to SourceForge has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Statement, SourceForge shall make reasonable efforts to notify the affected user, as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law, of what information has been disclosed, to the extent that SourceForge knows this information. 

###  No Guarantees For Factors Beyond SourceForge's Control 

**While this Privacy Statement expresses SourceForge's standards for maintenance of private data, it is not in a position to guarantee that the standards will always be met. There may be factors beyond SourceForge's control (e.g., "script kiddies", "crackers and other malcontents") that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, SourceForge disclaims any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of private information.**

###  Third Party Advertising and Cookies 

The ads appearing on the SourceForge Sites are delivered to visitors by DoubleClick Inc. (“DoubleClick”), SourceForge’s current third party web advertising partner.  In the course of serving advertisements to SourceForge Sites, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user’s browser.  Information about users’ visits to the SourceForge Sites, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad, are used to serve ads to visitors.  As with other cookies and consistent with SourceForge’s policy on cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the user's drive or memory.   If users do not want information about their visits to the SourceForge Sites used to target ads to them, they can get an opt-out cookie by clicking here: <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>.
