# Working Today - Privacy Policy

Your privacy concerns are important to Working Today. This Privacy Policy is designed to provide you with the information you need to control your personal information. Please note also that this Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Working Today [Terms of Use Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20060616032953id_/http%3A//www.workingtoday.org/security/termsofuse.php). 

  1. You may use most of this Web site without giving us information that identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number and similar information. We refer to these types of information as "Personally Identifying Information." As described below, we may request general information that describes certain characteristics, e.g., your zip code, age or other demographic information. We refer to this as "General Information."
  2. Working Today does not collect Personally Identifying Information about you unless you voluntarily provide such information.
  3. Working Today may request General Information for general statistical purposes. This type of General Information, as well as information concerning the Web sites from which users visit our site, may be provided to third parties in an aggregate form, which permits us to describe the characteristics of our users without identifying them specifically. We use this information for marketing, research and administrative purposes.
  4. Information collected through Working Today studies, polls, surveys, newsletters and questionnaires is used in the aggregate. No Personally Identifying Information will be distributed in these studies without the consent of the individuals who provide them.
  5. Working Today collects information about its Advocacy Partners and Freelancers Union (formerly known as Portable Benefits Network) members. This voluntarily submitted information is shared with outside parties only in the aggregate for the purposes of describing the organization, for funding proposals and for research. Personally Identifying Information will not be shared with outside parties, except where necessary for administering benefits.
  6. Postings in chat rooms that may be available on this Web site may be viewed by anyone who visits the chat rooms, message boards, forums, question-and-answer platforms or other areas that feature user contribution. You should exercise caution not to provide any Personally Identifying Information or other information that you would not want seen by others.
  7. Working Today reserves the right to use, without Personally Identifying Information, any questions, comments or other information submitted by users, in books, articles, commentaries, or research or in other similar ways. You represent and warrant that you have obtained any consent or approval under any applicable copyright, trademark, intellectual property or other laws that may be necessary to publish or store this information on our Web site.
  8. Standard 128-bit encryption certificate from Thawte is used to protect data passed through the site. Credit card transactions are encrypted and are processed using protocols that we believe are standard for Internet commerce. In making your decision whether to provide Personally Identifying Information, you should be aware of the general risks of transmitting information over the Internet. While Working Today attempts to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing our files or tampering with our site, we cannot guarantee that these efforts always will be successful. If your communication is sensitive, you may want to send it by postal mail (see [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20060616032953id_/http%3A//www.workingtoday.org/contact/index.html) for Working Today's address).
  9. If you visit a Web site that is linked to the Working Today Web site, you should consult that Web site's privacy policy before providing Personally Identifying Information.
  10. If you provide us with Personally Identifying Information, we will use it for the purpose for which it is given to us. For example, we will use Personally Identifying Information in order to respond to a request for further information or to process membership applications. Personally Identifying Information also may be used by us, or by entities with which we contract and from which we may receive fees for transmission of newsletters and advertisements in which you may be interested, and for other similar purposes, which are generally disclosed at the time the information is given. If you receive newsletters or other communications that you do not wish to receive, please contact us or follow the instructions for removing your name from the circulation list for that item. With respect to protecting the confidentiality of any Personally Identifying Information, Working Today will take commercially reasonable security measures to protect such identifying information and/or security measures required by applicable United States laws, regulations and rules. Working Today is not liable for disclosure of Personally Identifying Information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.
  11. Data collected on this site may be stored by third parties.
  12. Working Today's policy is that the Web site may be used only by individuals over the age of 18. We urge parents to supervise their children's use of the Web site. We do not collect any information from children. However, if a parent learns that a child has submitted Personally Identifying Information to our Web site, the parent should contact us and that information will be deleted.
  13. Any information that is outdated or changed will be handled under the same privacy policy as other information. This privacy policy is subject to change at anytime.
