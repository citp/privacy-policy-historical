											This privacy statement covers the site <a href="http://www.freelottocasino.com">www.freelottocasino.com</a> (FLC). Because this web 
											site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to 
											disclose its information practices. This policy does not apply to the practices of 
											companies that FLC does not own or control, or to people that FLC does not employ or 
											manage.   
											<br><br>
											<b><em>Surveys and Contests</em></b><br>
											From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or 
											surveys on our site (<a href="terms.asp">contest terms</a>).  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable 
											information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary 
											and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested 
											information typically includes contact information (such as email, name, and shipping address), 
											and demographic information (such as zip code).<br><br>
											We use collected information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site 
											traffic and/or personalize the site, and to send participants an email newsletter.
											<br><br>
											We use may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; 
											that company will be prohibited from using our users' personally identifiable 
											information for any other purpose.
											<br><br>
											<b><em>Cookies</em></b><br>
											FLC may set and access FLC cookies on your computer. 
											FLC allows other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages to 
											set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their 
											cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or 
											other companies do not have access to FLC cookies.
											<br><br>
											<b><em>Log Files</em></b><br>
											As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and 
											store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, 
											browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating 
											system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  
											<br><br>
											<b><em>Choice</em></b><br>
											If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, 
											you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each 
											newsletter or communication.
											<br><br>
											<b><em>Links to Other Sites</em></b><br>
											This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled 
											by FLC. Please be aware that we, FLC, are not responsible for the privacy 
											practices of such other sites.  We encourage you to be aware when you leave 
											our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that 
											collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies 
											only to information collected by this Web site. 
											<br><br>
											<b><em>Security</em></b><br> 
											We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal 
											information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  
											No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic 
											storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use 
											commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, 
											we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
											<br><br>
											<b><em>Changes in this Privacy Statement</em></b><br>
											If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
											to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate 
											so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under 
											what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
