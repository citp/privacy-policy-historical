**Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties**  
We will never sell or give away your personal information to third parties for purposes of building contact lists, or anything of that nature, without your permission. eBooks N' Bytes stands firmly against any transfer of personal information for reasons of building the contact lists of third parties. 

**Business Transition Exception**  
In the event the eBooks N' Bytes goes through a business transition, such as a merger, or being acquired by another company, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
