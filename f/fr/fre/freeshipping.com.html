              enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site. 
              Almost all web sites use cookies for these purposes. We use both 
              session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, 
              after users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent 
              cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for 
              an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by 
              following Internet browser help file directions. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 
              setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password 
              more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users 
              reject the cookie, they may still use our site. <br>
              Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of

              However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once

              </font></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like 
              most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet 
              protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider 
              (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and 
              number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#663399"><b>Clear 
              Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)<br>
              </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 
              third party advertising company may employs a software technology 
              called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better 
              manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. 
              Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in 
              function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements 
              of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear 
              gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size 
              of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied 
              to users' personally identifiable information.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clear 
              Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if 
              they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That 
              means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", 
              which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site (or 
              advertising company) would match the clear gif's identifier and 
              the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online 
              behavior for that computer. This collected information would then 
              be given to the advertising company. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know 
              which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us 
              to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
              Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
              When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their 
              information is protected both online and off-line.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
              our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information 
              (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and 
              is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - 
              SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon 
              on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft 
              Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, 
              when users are just 'surfing'. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
              we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we 
              also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. 
              All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information 
              mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who 
              need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
              billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted 
              access to personally identifiable information. </font></p>

              it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive

              a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip
