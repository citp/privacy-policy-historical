                            &nbsp;To enable Freedocast to make its sites more responsive to the needs of the
                            Users, Freedocast may use a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie,"
                            to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a type of user ID that may reside
                            on the User’s computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the User but
                            identifies only the computer that is used to access the site. Advertisers and other
                            third parties that provide products or services through the Freedocast site may
                            also assign their own cookies to the User’s browser and such process is beyond
                            Freedocast’s control. Freedocast may use both session cookies (which are temporary
                            and disappear after the User closes the browser) and persistent cookies (which remain
                            after the User closes the browser and which may be used by the User’s browser
                            on subsequent visits to the site). The User may reset the web browser to refuse
                            all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of
                            the Freedocast sites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies
                            is disabled.

                            GIFs" or "web beacons") that allow Freedocast and its affiliates
                            to count users who have visited particular pages or to access certain cookies. These
                            tools and other technologies to may be used to recognize which pages users visit,
                            and which links they click on. These features may also be included in email newsletters
                            so that Freedocast may learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. These
                            tools may also enable Freedocast to verify online purchases by the User from the
                            Freedocast sites or from third party sites that have agreed to share such information

                            Freedocast site. Any personally identifiable information provided by the User is
                            used to operate, maintain, and provide the User with the features and functionality
                            of the Freedocast sites. Freedocast does not use the User’s email address
                            or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages
                            without the User’s consent except as part of a program or feature for which
                            the User may exercise an option to not receive such messages. Freedocast may, however,
                            use the User’s email address without further consent for non-marketing or
                            administrative purposes. Freedocast may use both personally identifiable information
                            and certain non-personally-identifiable information to improve the quality and design
                            of the Services and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services
                            by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends. Freedocast uses
                            cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: remember information so that the

                            <br>
                            Freedocast does not store credit card information and other financial data. Credit
                            card transactions are transmitted to a financial gateway, and Freedocast endeavors
                            to protect the security of the User’s payment information during transmission
                            by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Freedocast will not disclose to
                            third parties the User’s your credit card information or other financial data
                            except to the extent necessary to complete the transaction initiated by the User.<br>

                            For e-commerce transactions, Freedocast may transmit the User’s billing information
                            using encryption which scrambles the credit card number and personal information.
                            However, since no security system is impenetrable, Freedocast cannot guarantee the
                            security of its databases, nor can it guarantee that information supplied by the
                            User won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.<br>

                            Freedocast has established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or
                            misuse of User information, but cannot guarantee that such information will never
                            be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. To protect the User’s
                            privacy and security, Freedocast may use passwords to help verify the User’s
                            identity before granting access or making corrections to any User information.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Freedocast uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards
                            to preserve the integrity and security of User information. Freedocast, however,
                            ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to Freedocast by the
                            User and is transmitted at the User’s own risk. Once Freedocast receives the
                            transmission of information, Freedocast makes commercially reasonable efforts to
                            ensure the security of its systems. However, Freedocast cannot a guarantee that
                            such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach
                            of any physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

                            If Freedocast becomes aware of a security systems breach, then Freedocast may attempt
                            to notify the User electronically so that the User can take appropriate protective
                            steps or may post a notice on the Freedocast sites. Depending on where the User
                            resides, the User may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach
                            in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw
                            consent from receiving electronic notice) the User should notify Freedocast using
                            the contact form.

                            The User may decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Freedocast
                            sites, in which case Freedocast may not be able to provide certain services. If
                            the User opts to register with and provide information to Freedocast, the User will
                            have the opportunity to unsubscribe, review, update, or delete the information provided
                            at any time. If the User opts to remove registration information completely, the
                            User may not be able to continue using certain services that require registration.
                            To protect the User’s privacy and security, Freedocast takes reasonable steps
                            (such as requesting a unique password) to verify the User’s identity before
                            granting profile access or making corrections. The User is responsible for maintaining
                            the secrecy of the unique password and account information at all times.
