We may automatically collect certain aggregated data regarding use of the FMO Service, like the number of users and frequency and manner of usage of the FMO Service. We may also collect aggregated information regarding the use of our subscription-based service network, such as the extent to which certain features are used. Aggregated information is anonymous, statistical information that reflects the scope of our user base, advertising use, customer patterns and related site information. We use this information to better understand how the FMO Service is used, and to improve the online experience of our users. This information is not used in a way that will personally identify you. In addition, certain non-personally identifiable information is collected by FMO and our third-party advertising providers (such as Google Adsense) during the course of serving advertisements to our website (but not your name, address, or other personal information). Such information is used by FMO and our advertising providers to facilitate and monitor the serving of advertisements.

Similarly, we may also use cookies to track and understand the traffic on our website. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that our website places onto your computer's hard drive. Cookies identify your computer hard drive so that we can recognize you the next time you visit us. We use cookies to collect and store some information about you, such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the date and time you access our website and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website. We use this information to better understand our users and customize our site for users' particular preferences. In the same manner, we may also engage third parties to monitor the usage of, and serve advertising to, the FMO Service. These third parties may use cookies to collect such information. You may disable cookies by following directions on your web browser. Disabling cookies also disables web beacons. You should be aware, however, that by disabling cookies you may be unable to access certain services and features of the FMO Service.

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site. Google's use of the [DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx)enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet.

For example, if you have given us permission, we may use your information to inform you of other products or services that you may find valuable. We may also use the information you provide to make improvements that better serve our users' needs.

**Security**

FMO is committed to taking appropriate measures to protect your privacy against unauthorized disclosures. FMO uses a variety of secure techniques designed to protect your information.

While we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly changes. As such, we cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your personal information from the threats of tomorrow, or that our security measures are failsafe and not subject to circumvention or unauthorized intrusion. You should also be aware that, despite our best efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of data.

**Third-Party Links**

Portions of the FMO Service may contain links to other third party websites that you may access. These other sites have their own privacy policies, and you should review those policies before following those links. We cannot control the information disclosed at these third-party sites or how that information is used.

The FMO Service provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving certain communications from us regarding products and services in which you may be interested. You will be given this opportunity at the time we request information about you. If you do not opt-out at the time you provide information, but choose to opt-out later, use the link provided in any message.
