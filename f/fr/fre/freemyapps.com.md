We will use personally identifiable information for the purpose(s) for which you provided the information. For example, we will use your email address and mobile number, respectively, to respond to an email/SMS inquiry you have made.

### Collection of Non Personally Identifiable Information 

We automatically collect IP addresses, website usage and application usage information from you when you visit our Site or download Applications. When you download and use Applications, we may also collect your “unique device ID” or “UDID,” which is a number uniquely associated with your mobile device. We cannot use the UDID to identify you personally, rather this information helps us evaluate how end users use our website and applications, and permits us to enhance those sites and applications. 

We may use the information collected about you in the following ways:

To maintain, operate, provide and enhance our Site and Services.

To allow us to personalize the content and target the advertising that you and others see based on personal characteristics, usage patterns and/or preferences.

We may combine the non personally identifiable information that we collect about you from your use of the Site and Services with other non personally identifiable information that you provide to us in connection with your use of other Fiksu products, services and websites.

We use third-party network advertisers, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These network advertisers may be supplied with or have access to your non personally identifiable information (such as IP address and UDID).

As stated above, we do not collect personally identifiable information unless you provide it to us. However, we do still want you to understand the limited circumstances under which your personally identifiable information could be disclosed if you do provide it to us.

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to comply with legal requirements or process, or where necessary to prevent or investigate fraud, to protect the safety of an individual. In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with subcontractors, vendors and other businesses that we employ to perform functions on our behalf. For example, we may employ third parties to send email campaigns or provide marketing assistance, or provide customer service. These entities have access to your information only for the purposes of performing the functions for which we have engaged them. If such entities have access to your personally identifiable information, their agreements with us require them to keep your information confidential.

We may also disclose personally identifiable information to a successor acquirer or other related entity, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.

### Fiksu Application Marketing

Fiksu buys mobile advertising space on behalf of certain mobile application providers (Clients). When you click on a Client ad or application link delivered by Fiksu, Fiksu servers receive and store the “unique device ID” or “UDID,” which is a number uniquely associated with your mobile device. Fiksu cannot use the UDID to identify you personally, but it does enable us to collect information about the kind of mobile device you use, the operating system for your mobile device, the applications you download from Fiksu Clients, and when, how, and how often you use those applications. 

We use your UDID and information about Client applications you download to report on the number of unique users who click through Fiksu Client ads, and the number of those users who download Client applications as a result of those ads.

We also use your UDID and the information associated with your UDID over time (e.g., the applications you download, when and how you use those applications, and any publisher-provided demographic data) to enhance our services and to select Fiksu Client ads that are most likely to be of interest to you.

Fiksu may disclose your non personally identifiable information (e.g. UDID, IP address, application usage information) to its advertisers, agents, contractors and other third parties in order to operate, provide and improve our services to our Clients and to end-users. In addition, we may disclose your non personally identifiable information to a successor acquirer or other related entity, in connection with a sale or transfer of some or all of our assets.
