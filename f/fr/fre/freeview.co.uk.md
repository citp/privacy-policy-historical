**(iii) Information that we obtain from third party sources**  
From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources (for example, market research companies or channel operators who you may have contacted), but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.

The types of information we collect from third parties include your interactions or experiences with the Freeview platform, Freeview Play services and/or products or the Digital Properties.

**What we do with the personal information we collect about you?**

We will only use the personal information you provide to us voluntarily for the relevant purposes made clear to you at the time you provide your details, such as to deal with your request or competition entry or to fix a problem you’re having with a Freeview product or service.

**(ii) Information sent to us by your web browser or mobile application**  
The information sent to us by your web browser or mobile application is aggregated and de-identified so that we can generically analyse the number of visits to our Digital Properties and their content, the average time spent on the Digital Properties, etc., to improve the Digital Properties’ content and functionality.

The information we collect automatically is not used to create individual visitor profiles. This means we will not track your individual navigation.

**(iii) Information that we obtain from third party sources**  
We use the information we receive from these third parties to provide troubleshooting assistance regarding our Freeview products or services, or to improve our Freeview products and services.

In general, we will use the personal information we collect from you only for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice or for purposes that we explain to you at the time we collect your personal information.

**Who do we share your personal information with?**  
We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:

  * to **Digital UK Limited** who manages technical aspects of the Freeview and Freeview Play platforms, t **hird party services providers and partners** who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Digital Properties; to help respond to support and advice requests; or to administer competitions on our behalf), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information;
  * to any **competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party** where we believe disclosure is necessary: (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;

  * to any **other person with your consent** to the disclosure.



**What legal grounds do we have to process your personal information?**  
If you live in the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “[How to contact us](https://www.freeview.co.uk/privacy-notice#privacy13)” heading below.

**Is your personal information transferred outside Europe?**  
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

Specifically, our site servers are located in the United Kingdom, and our third party service providers and partners operate in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. For further details of these safeguards please use the contact details below.

**What cookies and similar technologies do we use?**  
This website uses cookies as described in our [cookie statement](https://web.archive.org/cookie-statement).

**How does the Freeview mobile app use non-personal data?**  
The Freeview mobile app only records non-personal statistics about usage of the application in order to improve and better tailor the application for all users. If you do not wish for the Freeview mobile app to record these statistics, you may switch this off within the settings menu. To use the app you will need to enable access to location services or provide your postcode to allow for you to receive the correct content for your region. We do not store your postcode as this information is only used to assign your region when you first set up the application (you may need to re-enter your region from time to time).

**How long do we retain data for?**  
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. Such legitimate business interests include for example, to deal with any requests made by you, to provide you with a service or any help you have requested, to complete a competition or promotion we are running, to complete research insight or analysis, or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**What are your data protection rights?**

You have the following rights in respect of the personal information we collect and use about you:

  * If you wish to **access, correct, update or request deletion** of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided below.

  * Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can **withdraw your consent** at any time.

For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for the UK Information Commissioner’s Office can be found at [www.ico.org.uk](https://www.ico.org.uk/).
