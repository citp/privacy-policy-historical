             <p><b>Your Privacy</b>: The Free Library of Philadelphia (together with the City of Philadelphia, of which it is a branch, the "Library") respects your privacy. Our goal is to be your trusted, objective source for various online research needs. We want you to make the most of our services and feel confident while doing so online. We have a clear privacy policy: we collect no private, personal information unless you voluntarily supply it. This Privacy Statement explains under what circumstances we gather your individually identifiable information, how we use it, and who may access that information. It also provides you the means to "opt-out" of providing personal information that you do not wish to provide and to access, change, or remove any identifying information already collected. </p>
             <p> We believe that your privacy is of the utmost importance, which is why this statement regarding privacy of personally identifiable information provided online conforms to the Federal Trade Commission’s fair information practices of notice, choice, access, and security (<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm">http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm</a>). We hope that you will provide comments on how we can improve our online privacy policy for our website so that we may better accommodate your needs. </p>
             <p> Please read this policy in its entirety. You may contact us with any questions or comments by using the contact information listed at the end of this Privacy Statement. </p>
             <p> Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the Library website, and specifically does not apply to other companies’ or organizations’ websites to which we link. </p>

		      <p>When you visit the Library website, we do not collect any personally identifiable information without your consent. If you are simply perusing our site, we collect no personally identifiable information from you. In order to receive certain benefits of the Library website, however, we require that you provide us with your contact information. For example, if you are 18 years of age or older and you wish to register online for a Library card, we require that you provide us with your first and last name, street address, city, state, postal code, and date of birth. </p>
              <p> When registering online for a Library card, you are also invited, but not required, to provide us with certain additional contact and demographic information. Although the choice is up to you, we encourage you to volunteer such optional information so we understand better who uses our services so that we can be sure to tailor our services to you. </p>
             <p> On other pages within the Library website, we provide information about available positions of employment with the Library, and you are invited to send us via email your resume and any other personal indication of your interest in such employment </p>
             <p> If you prefer not to provide your personally identifiable information online or via email, we remain happy to accept such information in person at any of our 55 neighborhood branch locations (for card registrations) or by post (for resumes and other interest in employment). Feel free to address any inquiries by way of the contact methods listed at the end of this privacy statement. </p>
             <p> Finally, at times we may offer you the opportunity to contribute to the content of our website. Submission of any such content for publication on our website would be entirely voluntary on your part. Please note, however, that, unless you specifically request we withhold your personally identifiable information from such publication, any information you submit, and which we publish will not be subject to the protections of this privacy policy. </p>
