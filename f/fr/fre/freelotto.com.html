<h3>Collection and Data Utilization Agreement</h3>
<h3>Privacy Agreement</h3>
<p>IMPORTANT: The policies below are applicable to FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> and other sites on the World Wide Web portion of the Internet owned and operated by PlasmaNet, Inc.</p> 
<p>PlasmaNet, Inc. collects personally identifying information during contests or sweepstakes registration and this information is used from time to time as you use our website to: pay prize winnings, confirm entries, and selectively show you ads or send you promotions.</p> 
<p>Players' e-mail addresses and other personal information are kept in secure databases to protect our players' privacy.</p>
<p style="text-decoration:underline">No information should be submitted to or posted at any PlasmaNet websites by guests under 18 years of age. People under 18 years of age are not allowed to participate in FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> or other sweepstakes offered by PlasmaNet. If such a person wins, his or her entry is void.</p>
<p>All registrants receive e-mail confirming their registration and subsequent entries in FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> and daily FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> results with information of interest from FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font>. Additionally, from time to time you may receive other sponsored advertising messages from FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font>.</p>
<p>You may at any time modify your registration with PlasmaNet by editing your profile on our site.</p>
<p>Each email we send you will include a description of the simple unsubscribe process to enable you to stop receiving future e-mail of that type from FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font>. You may unsubscribe from each such email type this way. For example, unsubscribing from a daily FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> results email will result in you no longer receiving the daily FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> results by email. You may however continue to receive other types of email which you can unsubscribe from in the same fashion.</p>
<p>If you wish to stop receiving e-mail results from PlasmaNet and FreeLotto.com, you can quickly and easily unsubscribe yourself. To do so open results e-mail, scroll down to the line that reads: "If you'd prefer not to receive the results by e-mail, please click below to unsubscribe." If you play FreeLotto subsequent to unsubscribing from all e-mails, you are giving PlasmaNet Inc. definite permission to resubscribe you to all mail types and your subscription to receiving email results and other promotions will be automatically reinstated. This is necessary because of the substantial amount of money you can win.  Your prize notifications are sent via email and it is important to respond to these emails to claim any prizes won.  Furthermore, it is the sponsor that makes FreeLotto prizes possible and in order to play our games you must agree to receive our sponsored messages.</p>
<p>If you wish to no longer receive any email from FreeLotto, simply visit the "Edit Player Profile" page of our website and follow the easy instructions.</p>
<h3>About IP Addresses</h3>
<p>PlasmaNet collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.   This information is also used in your welcome email to confirm that in fact you have registered for FreeLotto and will be used in the event that you dispute registration.  In some cases an IP address is specific to your computer.  In other cases an IP address is randomly assigned with a block of IP addresses which are assigned by your ISP (internet service provider) every time you log on.</p>
<p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your ISP server. Web servers - the big computers that "serve" up Web pages - automatically identify your ISP by its IP address.</p>
<p>When players request pages from PlasmaNet websites, our servers log and record the players' IP addresses.</p>
<h3>Cookies - The PlasmaNet Online Cookies Policy</h3>
<p>What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your registration, passwords, and references while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them at most major Web sites.</p>
<p>By "looking" for a cookie our server can determine whether or not you have already registered to play. Cookies help our server to know you are playing, so that you don't need to register each time you play.</p>
<p>Cookies also help us to serve you better. Through the use of cookies we can better understand what information interests you, providing more of what you like and want from FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> and our advertisers.</p>
<p>Some examples of how we use cookies:</p>
<p>A cookie lets our computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Think of it as a membership card. Similarly, the cookie tracks which of our sponsors you've visited so that we can constantly introduce you to new and interesting sponsors. PlasmaNet may use information we collect through cookies for promotional or marketing purposes. Use of cookies to do the record keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. If you decline cookies, you may have difficulty playing your selections and adversely impact your FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> experience. We make our cookies available on an anonymous basis to other advertisers and advertising Networks so that they can serve you ads for products you are interested in. For example if you expressed interest in buying a new car you may receive ads about cars. However, we DO NOT include personally identifiable information with the cookies.</p>
<h3>What FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> cookies don't do:</h3>
<p>We DO NOT use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally provided by you or provided by your browser in a visit to PlasmaNet's web sites.</p>
<p style="text-decoration:underline">We do not use cookies to track other sites that you visit on the Internet.</p>
<p>You may get cookies from our advertisers if you visit their websites. PlasmaNet and FreeLotto<font size="3">®</font> do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to the PlasmaNet cookies policy. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard on the Internet. As mentioned above, we share non-personally identifiable information with third party ad serving partners so they may bring you targeted offers. This information can be associated with their cookies but will not include personally identifiable information such as your name or address. You may review our advertisers' privacy policies when visiting their sites. To learn more about third party ad serving and how to opt out from a third party ad server's cookie visit <a href="http://www.privacychoices.org">www.privacychoices.org</a></p>
<h3>Your Acceptance of These Terms</h3>
<p>By using any PlasmaNet Inc. owned and operated websites,  you are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, which include the PlasmaNet Privacy Policy, Official Rules of FreeLotto and the Terms of Use. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our websites. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page frequently for changes. Your continued use of the PlasmaNet sites or your continued acceptance of our results e-mail following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>
<p>You have the right to revoke the permission you have granted to us to contact you by email as explained above.</p>
<p>PlasmaNet respects your privacy. If you have any questions about this policy please e-mail termsofuse@freelotto.com.</p>
