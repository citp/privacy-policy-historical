### WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

This process is managed by MailChimp, one of the largest and most respected email management companies in the world. Outside of your voluntarily action to receive the newsletter updates, you remain totally anonymously to us.

Broadly speaking, any of the information we collect from you is used in the following way:

  * To send periodic emails: the email address you provide may be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your interest in the results of the Freddie Awards (winners), the conversations/dialogues about the Freddie Awards on other partner websites or information about a winner of prizes donated by some of our sponsors/partners.



If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site such as our email list manager, so long as these outside parties agree to keep this information confidential.

Our email list is not shared, even with sponsors or partners.
