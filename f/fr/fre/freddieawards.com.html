<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

Cookies are very small text files saved to your computer used to track your navigation around the Freddie Awards. This cookie is not identifiable other than by the website server, and does not store any information which could disclose personal information about you. Log files are merely a record of this information. Other information gathered may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent on the Freddie Awards, the websites visited just before and just after the Freddie Awards, what type of web browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) you are using, and your Internet Protocol (?IP?) address. Information is collected on an aggregate basis without any association to your personal information so that you remain anonymous as part of an overall analytics review. If you do not wish to transmit ?cookie? information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser; please consult the ?Help? section of your personal browser to correctly do so.</p>

<h3>DO WE DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION TO ADVERTISERS OR OUTSIDE PARTIES?</h3>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to advertisers, sponsors, partners or outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our site such as our email list manager, so long as these outside parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. Our email list is not shared, even with sponsors or partners.</p>

<h3>THIRD PARTY LINKS</h3>
<p>We may include or offer third party products or services on our site such as our sponsors and partners via links to their properties.

<h3>ANYTHING ELSE?</h3>
<p>There may be times when we may ask you to provide relevant data regarding your preferences and demographics information to answer survey questions. As in other instances, we will use this information in a non-personally identifiable manner.</p>
