  <p>Privacy Policy as of October 27, 2011.</p>
  <p>We respect the privacy of visitors to our
    site. AttorneyPages® and ExpertPages® and FreeAdvice® are among the units of
    Advice Company, a California corporation, a leading provider of legal and
    insurance information and general advice on the Internet.</p>
  <p>Please read this Privacy Policy so that you
    can understand how we seek to enforce our firm commitment to privacy. Questions
    regarding this statement should be directed to the Officer named below by
    emailing <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com">admin@adviceco.com</a></p>
  <p>We invite you to explore all our affiliated
    Websites, including AttorneyPages,  <a href="http://www.freeadvice.com/" style="text-decoration:underline;color:#356C80;">FreeAdvice</a> and <a href="http://expertpages.com/" style="text-decoration:underline;color:#356C80;">ExpertPages</a>.</p>
  <p><b><span style="color:red">Information this Site
    Gathers / Tracks</span></b></p>
  <p>The information gathered by Advice Company
    falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to
    our websites when they register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking
    information gathered as visitors navigate through our sites. Third party
    providers featured on or linked to from our websites, such as vendors of
    products and services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same
    kinds of information or additional information.</p>
  <p>To help make our sites more responsive to
    the needs of our visitors, help you navigate between sections, tailor content
    to your needs and to measure traffic within our sites, our web servers
    automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to
    the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our sites. They also
    invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to
    assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, which resides
    on your computer. The cookie helps give us an idea of which parts of our site
    users are visiting and doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer
    that a visitor uses to access our site.</p>
  <p>Unless you voluntarily identify yourself
    (through registration or sending a message, for example), we won't know who you
    are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information
    a cookie can contain is information you supply. Our cookies can't read
    unrelated data from your computer. Our advertisers and the third parties that
    provide products or services through our sites may also assign their own
    cookies to your browser, but we don't control their cookies or their processes,
    and they do not regularly share information they gather with us.</p>
  <p>To make use of certain features on our
    websites (such as to post a question or answer on our Community Forums and bulletin
    boards, to ask or answer a question on our Ask a Lawyer service, or to request
    a Free Case Evaluation from one or more lawyers) visitors need to register and
    to provide certain information as part of the registration process. We may also
    ask for information from those who buy products or services or conduct other
    transactions on our websites. We may ask, for example, for your name, email
    address, phone number(s), street address, gender, age, city or town, zip code
    (and for those who seek to purchase a product or service, credit card number
    and expiration date and code), and we sometimes request information on your
    interest in other topics.&nbsp; Those who choose to use our sites to transmit
    email messages to attorneys or experts also must provide certain identifying
    information, including name, city and state, email and phone number, so that
    the professional to whom the message is directed may reply to them.</p>
  <p>The information you supply may help us to
    offer you more personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests and
    make them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions. Of
    course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to
    take advantage by reading of the wealth of content available on our sites
    without registration. The vast majority of the content on our sites is
    available without requiring visitors to complete a registration form or give us
    contact information (such as a name and email address) to visit.</p>
  <p>The more we know about our visitors the
    more value we can potentially offer them. Supplying such information is
    entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we require, we may
    be unable or unwilling to provide you with services we make available to other
    visitors to our sites. For example, while we allow anyone to read postings in
    our Bulletin Board / Forums without registration, asking a question or
    furnishing an answer requires registration, which also may enable visitors to
    modify their own posts. Different registration may be required for different
    features on the site. And we can't send you targeted email alerting you to a
    relevant new response or new service we're offering, or articles on topics of
    interest to you, if you don't tell us what you're interested in and give us
    your email address. Similarly, we can't notify you that you've been lucky
    enough to win a prize in a promotional contest if we don't know how to contact
    you. Such personal information is gathered by us only with our users` knowing
    and active permission and participation.</p>
  <p>Our online surveys and contests ask
    visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic
    information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Demographic and
    profile data collected at our site may be shared with advertisers on an
    aggregate basis.</p>
  <p>We collect financial information (like an
    account or credit card numbers) only from visitors making a credit card or
    other purchase. We use the financial information solely to bill the user for
    products and services and necessary information from the order form to send
    orders.</p>
  <p>We also use customer contact information
    from the various registration forms, opt in features and service features to
    send the user information about our site, our company and our affiliates. Users
    may opt-out of receiving routine future mailings; see the choice/opt-out
    section below</p>
  <p>As this privacy policy reaffirms, we strive
    to protect confidentiality for our visitors. We do reserve the right to use
    customer contact and other information when we deem it necessary or appropriate
    to comply with applicable laws, rules, or lawful orders of courts and
    governmental agencies, to enforce compliance with the terms and conditions of
    agreements related to use of our sites, or to protect our Company, its staff, other
    users and other third parties from what we regard as harassment or threats of
    serious harm.</p>
  <p><b><span style="color:red">Links to Other Sites</span></b></p>
  <p>Our websites contain links to thousands of
    other sites. The establishment of a link does not mean that we have approved of
    a site, are endorsing a site, have reviewed its content, or are in any manner
    recommending a visit. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the
    content of linked Web sites.</p>
  <p><b><span style="color:red">Third Party Features</span></b></p>
  <p>Certain features of and portions on our
    site are also the result of special relationships, such as "Powered
    By" or Co-Branding or affiliate programs. For example, certain of our
    sites provide access to Legal Forms in conjunction with <span class="SpellE">LegalZoom</span> or US Legal Forms. These firms share varying amounts of information with us.
    You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of such providers before
    providing information to them.</p>
  <p><b><span style="color:red">Advertising and Cookies</span></b></p>
  <p>We display advertising on the Web site and
    we also work with several unaffiliated companies that serve ads when you visit
    portions of our website.&nbsp;Among the outside ad companies are Google® and
    its affiliates. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with such banner
    or other ads are collected by our advertisers and/or ad companies, and we do
    not have access to such information. These companies may use that information
    (not including your name, address, email address, telephone number, or credit
    card number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide
    advertisements on this site and about other sites and goods and services that
    they think may be of interest to you.</p>
  <p>To find out more about their practices, how
    these sites have told us they manage the privacy of information in conjunction
    with serving ads on our site, and to know your choices about not having this
    information used by such companies, please go to the advertising companies'
    websites.</p>
  <p><b><span style="color:red">Public Forums</span></b></p>
  <p>Certain of our sites make chat rooms,
    forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to their users. Please
    remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public
    information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your
    personal information. We do reserve the right to delete any postings at any
    time.</p>
  <p><b><span style="color:red">Security</span></b></p>
  <p>This site has numerous security measures in
    place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our
    control. The measures include passwords, linkages to secure servers,
    encryption, backup tapes, and conventional locks and alarm systems. However we
    cannot guarantee that the measures in place have been, are now, or will remain
    adequate.</p>
  <p><b><span style="color:red">Children's Guidelines</span></b></p>
  <p>This Web site is directed at adults, not
    children, and we do not seek to collect from children online contact
    information,&nbsp;or distribute to third parties any personally identifiable
    information from children, or entice children by the prospect of a special
    game, prize or other activity, to divulge information to us. We won't knowingly
    allow anyone under 13 to register with any of our sites or to provide any other
    personally identifying information without written approval of a parent or
    guardian.</p>
  <p><b><span style="color:red">Choice/Opt-Out</span></b></p>
  <p>Our site may provide users the opportunity
    to opt-out of receiving communications from us and sites associated with
    us&nbsp;at the point where we request information about the visitor. We may
    also give users various options for removing postings and other information,
    and to discontinue receive future communications from us. For example, the
    Forums have provisions for visitors to normally edit or remove postings they
    have made, and our Newsletters have linkages or return addresses for recipients
    to direct that they unsubscribe. For specifics concerning a matter impacting
    you, you can send email to <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com"><span style="text-decoration:none; text-underline:none">admin@adviceco.com</span></a> or by mail to the following postal
    address: <i>PO Box 1739, Sausalito,

  <p><b><span style="color:red">Revisions / Corrections /
    Updates</span></b></p>
  <p>We reserve the right to change our privacy
    policy from time to time. If we do change our privacy policy in the future,
    we'll post the changes when they take effect. This site gives users options for
    changing and modifying information previously provided, often at the feature on
    which you registered. For specifics concerning a matter impacting you, you can
    send email to <a href="mailto:admin@adviceco.com"><span style="text-decoration:none;">admin@adviceco.com</span></a> or by mail to the following postal
