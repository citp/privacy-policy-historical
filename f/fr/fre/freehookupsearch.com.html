  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How do we use cookies and other technical information?</strong><br>
    <br>
    <strong><em>Cookies and Web beacons.</em></strong> Third-party service providers, our business partners, our  affiliates, and we may send “cookies” to your computer (or mobile  device) or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at our  Website. “Cookies” are a string of information that a website stores on a  user’s computer (or mobile device), and that the user’s browser provides to the  website each time the user submits a query to the website. Cookies can identify  you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as  technical information. Cookies manage and measure the performance of  advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us or other networks or websites.  Cookies can either be persistent (that is, they remain on your computer until  you delete them) or temporary (that is, they last only until you close your  browser). Cookies on our Website do not link to or store your personal  information.<br>
    <br>
    For example, when you sign  in to our Website, we will record your user or member ID and the name  associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We  also may record your password in this cookie file, if you told us that you  would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we  encrypt account-related data that we store in these cookies. For websites and services  that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique  identifier. We may use persistent tracking cookies on your mobile device,  mainly for security protection purposes, such as to prevent phishers, scammers,  unauthorized log in attempts, and to help you access your hacked account. We  may allow our service providers to serve cookies from our Website or  application to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing  analysis and research on the effectiveness of our Website, content, and  advertising. <br>
    <br>
    Our Website may use locally stored objects  (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) to provide certain content, such as  video on demand, video clips, or animation. The Adobe Flash Player and similar  applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage  similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your browser,  but you can access your Flash management tools from <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">Adobe’s website</a>.<br>
    <br>
    We may also use “Web beacons” that  monitor your use of our Website. “Web beacons” (also known as clear gifs, pixel  tags, or Web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in  function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users or to  access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s device, Web  beacons are embedded invisibly on the webpages (or in email) and are about the  size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use Web beacons to collect  the following information: (1) the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the  computer that downloaded the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (2) the  URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (3)  the time the webpage containing the Web beacon was viewed; (4) the types of  browser that fetched the Web beacon; and (5) the identification number of any  cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. <br>
    <br>
    When corresponding with you through  HTML capable email, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our  email.<br>
    <br>
  On their own, cookies or Web beacons do  not contain or reveal any personal information. But if you choose to furnish  personal information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the  cookies/Web beacons.<br>

  <li><strong>Do you have any choices about collection and use of your information?<br>
    <br>
  </strong>You can choose not to  provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to  use certain features of our Website because that information may be required in  order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate  in a live interaction or promotion; ask a question; or initiate other  transactions. <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    Our mobile applications may  also deliver notices to your phone or mobile device.

  </li>
  <li><strong>What is “Do Not Track” and does the Website follow it?<br>
    <br>
  </strong>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a  privacy preference that you can set in your Web browser. DNT is a way for you  to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about  your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.  We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information  we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt-out. However, we  do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works  toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a  common approach to responding to DNT.<br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How secure is your personal information?<br>
    <br>
  </strong>We take reasonable administrative,  physical, and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your  information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes using Secure  Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the personal information you  input, and storing your information in encrypted form behind a firewall  designed to block access from outside our network. <br>

      <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the  privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot be made  absolutely secure. Moreover, we cannot assure you that your personal information  that we collect will not be used or disclosed inconsistently with this privacy  policy. We assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your  information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or  other causes beyond our reasonable control.</td>

  </li>
  <li><strong>What about other websites linked to our Website?<br>
    <br>
  </strong>There  are places on the Website where you can click on a link to access other  websites. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our Website, you may  be taken to a third-party website. These third-party websites may independently  solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and,  in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those  websites. Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this privacy  policy concerning personal information that you provide directly to those third  parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We neither own nor  control third-party websites accessible through our Website. Thus, this privacy  policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by third parties  that operate them. We assume no responsibility for the content or the privacy  policies of any other websites that may provide links to our Website or to whom  we may provide links, or for the privacy policies of any of their advertisers.  Before visiting a third-party website, whether by means of a link on this  Website or otherwise, and before providing any personal information to any  third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies any practices  (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those  steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect your privacy. <br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What about information you provide about yourself while using our  Website?<br>
    <br>
  </strong>We  have designed the Website to make it easy for you to find, connect, and  interact with other members of the Website by posting information about  yourself. You can also use our electronic messaging system, which allows you to  communicate with other users provided you are both subscribers. We recommend  and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the  information they disclose about themselves. We also do not recommend that you  put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names  or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ license  details, and other sensitive information in your profile, which is open to  abuse and misuse. <br>
    <br>
    Please  be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such  as your religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily  provide this information to us when you create your profile, including your  sexual preferences and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so.  Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on the  Website may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload  and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly  consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other  users. <br>
    <br>
    When  you post information about yourself or use the messaging service, the amount of  personal information you share is at your own risk. In addition, these postings  may appear on other websites or in searches on the subject matter of your  posting. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on  publicly-viewable webpages, you make that information publicly available and  others can collect and use that information. For example, if you post your  email address, you may receive unsolicited email messages. If you post anything  that is inconsistent with our <a href="terms.php" target="_blank">terms</a>, we reserve the right to terminate your account. <br>
    <br>
  Bottom  line: <strong>We cannot control who reads your posting or what  other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage  you to exercise discretion and caution for your personal information. </strong><br>
  <br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What information does the  Website collect about children?<br>
    <br>

That means  we do not knowingly collect any information about children, minors, or anyone  under the age of majority. Nor do we knowingly market to children, minors, or  anyone under the age of 18. If you are less than 18-years old, we request that  you do not submit information to us. If we become aware that a child, minor, or  anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal  information, we will take steps to terminate that person’s registration and  delete that person’s profile information from the Website. If we do delete a  profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email  and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by  creating a new profile. <br>
  <br>
  Our  Website is also <a href="http://www.rtalabel.org/" target="_blank">RTA®</a> labeled and will not be visible if your computer is child protected.
