We work with third party online advertising networks to deliver advertising on the Websites, Apps and

technologies. We are not responsible for information collected by third party advertisers in this manner,
nor for the collection or use of information by other sites to which the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media
Service is linked.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers, ad networks, and
websites for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain
practices. Any data obtained by third-party ad servers subsequently shared with us is maintained and
dealt with by us in accordance with this privacy policy. When you access the Websites, Apps or delPlaya
Media Service through a service partner, we may add your email address or other personalized

Media Service. This information may include your IP address, browser type, and other software or

identifiable information that you provide to us. These third parties may include advertisers that make
features available through the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service, access partners, and
marketing companies that create or sell other marketing data. delPlaya Media is only responsible for
abiding by its own privacy policy and will assume no liability if a business partner or other entity collects,
uses or shares any information about you in violation of its own privacy policy or applicable law.

We use your personal information and non-personal information to provide you with services, to notify
you of new products or services, and communicate with you. We also use the information that we

and telemarketing. Additionally, we may share such personal information with the broadcaster to whose
station you use.
By providing personal information to us you agree:
         • all information you have provided is true and correct to the best of your knowledge;
         • you are establishing a business relationship with delPlaya Media and with its advertising and
         marketing partners; and
         • you are requesting and expressly consenting to be contacted via telephone (whether wireless
         or wired), including by live or prerecorded, calls using an automated dialing system, email,
         and/or mail by us, our network partners, and third-party affiliates and marketing partners
         regardless of whether your telephone number is on any Do Not Call list(s)
         • From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses and third
         party marketing partners whom we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their
         privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract
         with Service Providers and third-party marketing partners to provide certain services, such as
         hosting and maintenance, customer relationship management, data storage and management,
         and direct marketing campaigns. We provide our Service Providers and/or third-party marketing
         partners with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each
         Service Provider and/or third-party marketing partner must agree to use reasonable security
         procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to
         protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.
We may work with third-party marketing and advertising companies ("Ad Networks"). These companies

use of information that an Ad Network may collect from you. It also does not cover any information that


you may choose to provide to an Ad Network or to an advertiser whose goods or services are advertised
through the Websites, Apps or delPlaya Media Service. For such information, you are subject to the
terms of the Ad Networks’ privacy policy. We may share personal information and non-personal
information with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with delPlaya Media. If
delPlaya Media is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we
may disclose or transfer personal information and non-personal information in connection with such
transaction. We shall also cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties
to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose personal information and non-personal
information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion,
we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders
and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of delPlaya Media or of any third party, to
prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.
