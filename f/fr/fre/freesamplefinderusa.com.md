**YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

The California “Shine the Light” law permits users who are California residents to request information regarding our disclosure of their Information to third parties including the categories of Information shared and a list of the names and addresses of third parties with whom the Information was shared.  If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: www.FreeSampleFinderUSA.com – Privacy Officer, 128 Court Street, 3rd Floor, White Plains, NY  10601.  In your request, please specify that you want "Your www.FreeSampleFinderUSA.com 

 California Privacy Rights Notice."  Please allow 30 days for a response. 

  **Browser “Do Not Track” Signals:   **Most browsers contain a “do-not-track” setting.  In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the user’s browser notifies other websites that the user does not want their personal information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for behavioral advertising.  As required by recent Shine the Light law amendments we are required to inform you that, as is the case with most websites, we do not honor or alter our behavior when a user to our Site has activated the “do-not-track” setting on his/her browser.

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

We may change this Policy at any time.
