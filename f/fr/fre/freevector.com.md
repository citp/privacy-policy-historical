We collect personal information when you provide it to us by becoming a FreeVector.com member, when you sign up to receive our newsletters, send us messages or emails or when you download or buy one of our products. By using or accessing FreeVector.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

When you become a FreeVector.com member, you create your own profile, which contains certain personal information, such as your name, nickname, your gender, your address, your email address and any other information that you provide to us. Your member information, as well as your (nick)name, email and avatar, are displayed to other people visiting the FreeVector.com website.

We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) permitted by you 2) reasonably necessary to offer the service or 3) legally requested as we might be required to disclose user information in compliance with applicable laws.

We may use third parties to facilitate our operations, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to process payments for products or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these activities.

Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the FreeVector.com-specified purposes. We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through on-site offers. We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other websites, brands or companies.

### THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING

Advertisements that appear on FreeVector.com are sometimes served directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked.

FreeVector.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on FreeVector.com unless you choose to share it with them.
