<h3>Privacy Notice</h3> 
<div style="padding: 15px 25px 5px 25px; font-size:14px;  " align="justify">Effective November 6, 2008<br><br>
		Our Commitment To Privacy<br><br>
			Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your 
			privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and 
			the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 
			To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at 
			every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.<br>
		The Information We Collect:<br><br>
		    This notice applies to all information collected or submitted 
			on the Freado website. The types of personal information collected 
			are:<br><br>
		   <ul>
				<li>
					Name</li>
				<li>
					Address</li>
				<li>
					Email address</li>
				<li>
					Phone number etc.</li>
				
			</ul>
				On some pages, you can submit information about other people. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:<br><br>
		<ul>
				<li>
					Name</li>
				<li>
					Address</li>
				<li>
					Email etc.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<br>The Way We Use Information:<br><br>
		We use the information you provide about yourself when 
			placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information 
			with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.<br><br>
		We use the information you provide about someone else when 
			placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not 
			share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to 
			complete that order.<br><br>
		We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. 
			Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with 
			outside parties.<br><br>
		You can register with our website if you would like to 
			receive our catalog as well as updates on our new products and services. 
			Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless 
			you fill out the registration form.<br><br>
		We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better 
			design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an 
			advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, 
			or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, 
			but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those 
			individuals.<br><br>
		Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable 
			information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above 
			without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such 
			unrelated uses.<br><br>
		Our Commitment To Data Security<br><br>
		To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and 
			ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate 
			physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the 
			information we collect online.<br><br>
		Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:<br><br>
		Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially 
			important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our 
			website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is 
			structured to attract anyone under 13.<br><br>
		How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information<br><br>
		You can correct factual errors in your personally 
			identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error<br><br>
		To protect your privacy and security, we will also take 
			reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making 
			corrections.<br><br>
		How To Contact Us<br><br>
		Should you have other questions or concerns about these 
			privacy policies, please call us at 412-567-2089 or send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@freado.com">
