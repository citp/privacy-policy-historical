  * We monitor patterns of usage, such as login dates and volumes of data, so we can understand how people are using freewebstore to develop and improve our products.
  * We also monitor patterns of usage so that we can tailor any communications we may send you or advertising you may receive. For example, we may tailor your newsletter with information about product features that you haven't tried yet, instead of features that you use frequently.
  * For security reasons, to aid in monitoring patterns of usage and to improve user experience, we log your IP address when you use the website. This is your computer's individual identification number that is assigned to your computer when connected to the Internet.
  * We monitor traffic information when you visit our site or read our emails, including things like page visits, email clicks, referring sites, and video viewings. We use this information to improve our website, advertising, promotions, and to understand customer purchasing behaviour. Please see Section 9: Use of Cookies below regarding Cookies.

It will also enable us to produce reports you request as part of the services we provide.

Should you choose to use parts of freewebstore that involve providing yours or your customers personal and/or financial data to third parties (for example, if you choose to download order data and give this to your accountant, work colleagues or third-party accountancy packages), then it is your responsibility to ensure you comply with the law concerning Data Protection. Such personal and / or financial data may include for example, general, financial data or personal data such as email address, address, VAT No. You are able to select or de-select certain fields when you choose to produce a data extract and download order details.
