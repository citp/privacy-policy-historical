                        <p>FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by Experian is based on FICO Score 8. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not. For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8.</p>
                        <p>FICO Score 8 ranges from 300 to 850. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk. There are three different major credit reporting agencies — Experian, TransUnion<sup>®</sup> and Equifax<sup>®</sup> — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.</p>

                    We collect personal information and non-personal information through the Site. Personal information is information that identifies you as an individual. Non-personal information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    <em><strong>Personal information.</strong></em> We may collect the following types of personal information:
                    </p><ul>
                        <li>Information provided by you when ordering credit-related products through the Site. For example, you will be required to submit personal information such as your name, address, social security number, date of birth, telephone number and e-mail address.</li>
                        <li>Information provided about your children when enrolling your children in child identity monitoring products.

                        <li>Credit and debit card account information collected from you or your credit reports when enrolling in our card registry product. For example, we will collect credit and debit card account information from you on our sites, over the phone, and from your credit reports from the three national credit reporting companies in order to cancel the cards per your request in the event that they are lost or stolen. </li>
                        <li>When you make a purchase through the Site, we may collect your credit card number or other payment account number, billing address and other information related to such purchase (collectively, <strong>"Payment Information"</strong>) from you.</li>
                        <li>Other information we collect, such as city of birth and mother's maiden name, is used to verify your identity in the event you forget your login information required for our online products.</li>
                        <li>Information you provide us through customer service correspondence and general feedback.</li>
                        <li>Video content you choose to submit to us, such as commentary about our products and services, testimonials, or other similar content you share through video.</li>

                <p></p>
                <p>
                    <em><strong>Non-Personal information.</strong></em> When you visit the Site, we may collect non-personal information, such as a catalog of the Site pages you visit. Non-personal information is generally collected through the Site from the following sources: server log files, environmental variables, cookies, pixel tags and other similar technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.
                    </p><ul>
                        <li><strong>Server Log Files.</strong> Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Variables.</strong> We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</strong>We, our service providers, and/or non-affiliated Third-parties, may use "cookies" or similar technologies on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by many websites, and can facilitate your ongoing access to and use of a particular website; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your computer. Additionally, please see the "Your Choices" section below for instructions on how to opt-out of sharing certain information related to the use of cookies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pixel Tags.</strong> We, our service providers, and/or non-affiliated Third-parties, may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, <strong>"Pixel Tags"</strong>) in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors' hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, to provide online advertising, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.</li>
                        <li><strong>Information That You Voluntarily Provide.</strong> We also collect non-personal information (e.g., your geographic location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information is not combined with any personal information, such information is considered to be non-personal information, as it does not personally identify you or any other user. Additionally, we may aggregate personal information in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using personal information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered non-personal information for purposes of this Policy.</li>
                        <li>Please note that if we combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information as long as it is so combined.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    </p><h2>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED?</h2>
                    <em><strong>Personal Information.</strong></em> We may use personal information we collect in the following ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fulfillment of Requests.</strong> We may use personal information collected about you to provide you with products, services or information that you request.</li>
                        <li><strong>Administrative Communications.</strong> From time to time we may use personal information to send to you important information regarding the Site, or changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information may be important to your use of the Site, you may not opt-out of receiving such communications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other Communications.</strong> From time to time, we may use personal information to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer that we do not send such email marketing messages to you, please see the "Your Choices" section below.</li>
                        <li><strong>Purchases.</strong> We may use personal information, including Payment Information in order to fulfill your purchase.</li>
                        <li><strong>Promotions.</strong> We may operate sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, <strong>"Promotions"</strong>) through the Site. We typically ask you for certain personal information when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about our use of personal information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of personal information conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules will control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Business Purposes.</strong> We may also use personal information for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis and audits. In addition, we may also use personal information to enhance our information and to aid us in providing our customers with targeted promotions.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p><em><strong>Non-Personal Information.</strong></em> Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose such non personal information to other third parties, for any purpose.</p>
                <p>In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personal information. If we combine any non-personal information with personal information so that it personally identifies you, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information as long as it is combined.</p>
                <p>We may, along with our affiliates and marketing partners enhance and/or merge personal information about you with data collected from other sources and use it in direct and/or online marketing and, to the extent permitted by law, individual reference and look-up service programs. In the event we enhance and/or merge such personal information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information.</p>
                <p>
                    </p><h2>DO WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES?</h2>
                    We may disclose information about you to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may disclose the information that we collect to our affiliated companies to provide the products you request, to enhance our products to better suit your needs, and from time to time for marketing purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Business Partners.</strong> We may partner with other companies to offer you products or services or to fulfill the products or services that you order. We may disclose personal information and/or non-personal or de-identified information collected about you to such third-party partners for the purposes described in this Policy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to data analysis, order fulfillment, list enhancement and other administrative services.

Such services may include: marketing distribution, email list management services, advertising, certain product functionalities, customer support, web hosting, customer data management and enhancement, fulfillment services (e.g., companies that fill product orders or coordinate mailings), research and surveys, data analysis and email service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from Site users to an affiliate or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>
                        <li><strong>Law enforcement; emergencies; compliance; other purposes permitted by law.</strong> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose personal information to others as we believe appropriate (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to respond to governmental requests; (c) to enforce our Terms of Use; (d) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., our affiliated companies, you or others; (e) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (f) for any other purpose permitted by applicable law.</li>

                        <p>FICO<sup>®</sup> Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by Experian is based on FICO Score 8. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not. For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8.</p>
                        <p>FICO Score 8 ranges from 300 to 850. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk. There are three different major credit reporting agencies — Experian, TransUnion<sup>®</sup> and Equifax<sup>®</sup> — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.</p>
