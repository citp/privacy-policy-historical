# Privacy Policy | Freelancer

Modified 24 May 2018

### Our privacy obligations

Freelancer.com (" **Freelancer** ") is governed by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) under the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth). The APPs regulate how personal information is handled by Freelancer.com. 

'Personal information' means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. Freelancer's Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected and/or held by Freelancer. 

This Privacy Policy also explains how we process 'personal data' about people in the European Union (EU), as required under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 

We will review this policy regularly, and we may update it from time to time. 

### The types of personal information we collect and hold

We collect personal information about our users in order provide our products, services, and customer support. Our products, services, and customer support are provided through many platforms including but not limited to: websites, phone apps, email, and telephone. The specific platform and product, service, or support you interact with may affect the personal data we collect. 

Not all information requested, collected, and processed by us is "Personal Information" as it does not identify you as a specific natural person. This will include majority of "User Generated Content" that you provide us with the intention of sharing with other users. Such "Non-Personal Information" is not covered by this privacy policy. However, as non-personal information may be used in aggregate or be linked with existing personal information; when in this form it will be treated as personal information. As such, this privacy policy will list both types of information for the sake of transparency. 

In some situation users may provide us with personal information without us asking for it, or through means not intended for the collection of particular types of information. Whilst we may take reasonable steps to protect this data, the user will have bypassed our systems, processes, and control and thus the information provided will not be governed by this privacy policy. 

In some situations users may provide us personal information over platforms that are outside our control; for example through social media or forums. Whilst any information collected by us is governed by this Privacy Policy, the platform by which it was communicated will be governed by its own Privacy Policy. 

### How we collect personal information

### How we use personal information

The information we request, collect, and process is primarily used to provide users with the product or service they have requested. More specifically, we may use your personal information for the following purposes:

  * when necessary for the performance of a contract to which the user is party;
  * processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations;
  * processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of our users or of another natural person.
  * processing is done in pursuing our legitimate interests, where these interests do not infringe on the rights of our users.



We use automated decision when helping matching users to jobs. The primary way this occurs is through how we rank users. These rankings are produced by analysing user generated content, user activity and the outcome of jobs; in this context, user generated content will include reviews that users receive when completing jobs. More information on these ranking guides can be found in our community articles. Automated decision making is also used to recommend potential jobs to our users and as a part of our marketplace security systems. 

### When we disclose personal information

##### Third party applications

Users are able to remove third party applications from access their data through their settings.

### Accessing, correcting, or downloading your personal information

You have the right to request access to the personal information Freelancer holds about you. Unless an exception applies, we must allow you to see the personal information we hold about you, within a reasonable time period, and without unreasonable expense for no charge. Most personal information can be accessed by logging into your account. If you wish to access information that is not accessible through the platform, or wish to download all personal information we hold on you in a portable data format, please contact our Privacy Officer. 

You also have the right to request the correction of the personal information we hold about you. All your personal information can be updated through the user settings pages. If you require assistance please contact our customer support. 

### Exercising your other rights

You have a number of other rights in relation to the personal data Freelancer holds about you, however, there may be restrictions on how you may exercise the rights. This is largely due to the nature of the products and services we provide. Much of the data we collect is in order to facilitate contracts between users, facilitate payments, and provide protection for the legitimate users of our marketplace - these data uses are protected against the below rights. 

You have the right to: 

  * seek human review of automated decision-making or profiling
  * opt-out of direct marketing, and profiling for marketing
  * erasure
  * temporary restriction of processing.



**Human review of automated decision making / profiling** \- In the case of our ranking algorithms, it is not possible to exercise this right as this ranking is a fundamental part of the marketplace that users participate in, opting out would mean not being able to participate in the marketplace. Decisions affecting marketplace security are already reviewed by humans. 

**Direct marketing and profiling** \- users can control what emails they receive through their settings page. 

**Erasure** \- Most personal information and user generated content cannot be deleted as they are used to support contracts between users, document financial transactions, and are used in providing protecting other legitimate users of the marketplace. In the case of non-personal data that can be linked with personal data, it will either be erased or otherwise anonymised from the personal data.

**Temporary restriction to processing** \- under certain circumstances you may exercise this right, in particular if you believe that the personal data we have is not accurate, or you believe that we do not have legitimate grounds for processing your information. In either case you may exercise this right by contacting our privacy officer. 

Unless stated above, users may exercise any of the above rights by contacting our Privacy Officer.
