Children's Privacy

**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. Freelance-Help.com encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer: 

Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc. 

Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 

Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated. 

Check out the FTC's site < http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html > for more tips on protecting children's privacy online.
