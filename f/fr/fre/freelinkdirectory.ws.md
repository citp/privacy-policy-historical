Personal Information

As a visitor to the site, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information.

When you order products or services as a featuredlinkdirectory.ws subscriber, we may collect the following Personal Information from you:

  * Contact information such as your name, phone number, address and email address
  * Billing information such as the number, expiration date, card type and billing address of your credit card
  * Demographic information such as your job title, job description and company name and company type.



If you submit content to featuredlinkdirectory.ws for licensing, you may be asked to provide the following information:

  * Contact information such as your name, phone number, primary address, and email address.
  * featuredlinkdirectory.ws will verify this information by asking you to either: a) upload a scan of a government issued ID (which will be stored on our servers); or b) provide a credit card number. Your credit card number will be used solely for the purpose of verifying your name and address. The credit card number will not be stored.
  * Payment and contributor information including, but not limited to, payout method, payout email, desired display name, skill level, content focus, etc.



Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

As is true of most websites, when you use the Site, featuredlinkdirectory.ws or third parties authorized by featuredlinkdirectory.ws may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. featuredlinkdirectory.ws also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. To better understand the needs of our visitors to the Site we may occasionally match such information with your Personal Information.

In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, and prevent abuse of our system, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submit to us with information from third-party sources. For example, we may supplement your contact information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in our database. As permissible, we may also supplement the information you provide to us with demographic and other information (such as age or interest in photography) stored in third-party databases in order to make it more likely that marketing communications we send will be of interest to you.

**Information Sharing with third parties**

featuredlinkdirectory.ws uses one or more outside credit card processing companies to bill you for our goods and services. To the best of our knowledge, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

We also share Personal Information with certain companies that perform services on our behalf. We only share the Personal Information which is necessary for them to perform those services. We require any company with which we may share Personal Information to protect that data in a manner consistent with this policy and to limit the use of such Personal Information to the performance of services for featuredlinkdirectory.ws.

We do not sell or otherwise provide Personal Information to other companies for the marketing of their own products or services.
