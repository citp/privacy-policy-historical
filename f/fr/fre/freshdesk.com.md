##### Information Collected From You

We collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, information about the pages users access on the Website, and information voluntarily submitted by the user (for example, filling out a survey or service registration form). The types of information that may be requested include your name, company name, email address, telephone number and billing information. The information we collect is used to provide the Service to you, to improve the quality of the Website and Service, to communicate information about the Service, to provide you with support when you are using our Website or Service, to bill your account for the Service provided and to contact you about your account when necessary. Your information will never be sold to or shared with other companies or organizations for commercial purposes or otherwise, except as outlined in this Policy.

Freshdesk may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Service such as third-party payment processors etc. provided, that such service provider is not permitted to store, retain or use such information except to process your credit card and other payment information for Freshdesk.

Other information such as end user device models, IP, usage patterns are also captured by the Service. This information is not used by Freshdesk except in allowing You to view and use this information for targeting future communication with the end users. Content and messages in voice, text or other format created by you or your end users to send or share with other users or end users shall be hosted on Freshdesk’s servers. Content and messages created by your use of the Service shall be available for a period of 14 days from the termination of your subscription, post which they may be deleted at Freshdesk’s sole discretion without notice. Freshdesk may, however, choose to keep the content hosted on the server for as long as it wishes to and shall not comply with your request in any form to purge such content.

Freshdesk collects information on behalf of our clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our clients may interact using the Service. If you are a customer of one of our clients and would no longer like to be contacted by that Client, please contact the client that you interact with directly. If client requests Freshdesk to correct, amend or delete data, we will respond to this request as soon as possible.

We host and process data, including personal information, in the United States and the European Economic Area and possibly in other countries through third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service. When you access or use our Website or the Service, or otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting, on behalf of you and your authorized agents or end-users, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EEA or Switzerland based customers, who control their customer data and send it to Freshdesk for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, Freshdesk’s customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EEA member state before sending personal information to Freshdesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.

As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Service. In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information as more fully described under the section below entitled, “Protection of Information”.
