We may enter agreements with our customers located in the EEA to provide them access to our Service, which includes the processing of information relating their customers. In providing our Service, we do not own, control or direct the use of the information stored or processed on our platform at the direction of our customers, and in fact we are largely unaware of what information is being stored on our platform and only access such information as reasonably necessary to provide the Service (including to respond to support requests), as otherwise authorized by our customers or as required by law. We are the data processors and not the data controllers of the information on our platform for purposes of the EU Directive on Data Protection (Directive) and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection. Our EEA or Switzerland based customers, who control their customer data and send it to Freshdesk for processing, are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the Directive. In particular, FreshDesk’s customers are responsible for complying with the Directive and relevant data protection legislation in the relevant EEA member state before sending personal information to Freshdesk for processing. We work with our customers to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.

As the processors of personal information on behalf of our customers, we follow their instructions with respect to the information they control to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Service. In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, personal information as more fully described above under the section above entitled, “Protection of Information”.

#### How Do We Collect, Use and Share Your Personal Information and Other Information?

The types of information that may be requested include your name, company name, email address, telephone number and billing information. The information we collect is used to provide the Service to you, to improve the quality of the Website and Service, to communicate information about the Service, to provide you with support when you are using our Website, to bill your account for the Service provided and to contact you about your account when necessary. Your information will never be sold to or shared with other companies or organizations for commercial purposes or otherwise, except as outlined in this Policy.

Freshdesk may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Service such as third-party payment processors etc. Transfers to these third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice, and the service agreements with such third parties.

Freshdesk collects information on behalf of our clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals with whom our clients may interact using the Service. If you are a customer of one of our clients and would no longer like to be contacted by that Client, please contact the client that you interact with directly. If client requests Freshdesk to correct, amend or delete data, we will respond to this request as soon as possible.

We host and process data, including personal information, in the United States and the European Economic Area and possibly in other countries through third parties that we use to operate and manage the Service. When you access or use our Website or the Service, or otherwise provide information to us, you are consenting, on behalf of you and your authorized agents or end-users, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such consent) to the processing and transfer of information in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

##### Clear Gifs and Log Files

We may also employ (only where we have your consent in certain locations), and our third party advertising partners may employ, a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users of our Website. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients open. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

_Do Not Track._ Do Not Track (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third parties. We do not use technology that recognizes DNT signals from your web browser.
