### Policy Effective Date

This policy is effective as of February 19, 2014 and replaces any and all previous versions. 

### Scope and Application of Policy

Freightquote.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Freightquote”) created this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The policy describes collection, use, storage, sharing and protection of your personal information for the Freightquote.com website and all related sites, applications, services and tools where this policy is referenced, regardless of how you access or use them, including mobile devices. 

### Consent

By using the Freightquote.com website and its related sites, products, applications, services and tools, or registering for an account with Freightquote, you expressly consent to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. Further, you acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your registration and any other information you provide if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders, other compulsory disclosures, or at the advice of legal counsel; (2) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a user, individual, or government agency; or (3) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Freightquote, our users or the public. 

Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person. 

Users may check the Privacy Policy periodically to view any changes or updates. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are initially posted on this site.

### Our Disclosure of Your Information

We limit the disclosure of personal information to third parties to information required for shipment administration, including, but not limited to, shipping and receiving information, which we submit electronically to the freight carrier.

Trade associations, whose access is restricted to the names and addresses of their own members or Agents, whose access is restricted to the account and shipment information for those users they have enrolled. Associations and Agents have no direct access to any Freightquote databases. 

Law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in connection with or in response to a criminal investigation, investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other alleged unlawful or illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other Freightquote user to legal liability.

If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.) 

We may engage other companies to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, printing and mailing invoices, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis.
