Your information is collected via two ways. Firstly, browsing the "FreeFileSync Forum" will cause the phpBB software to create a number of cookies, which are small text files that are downloaded on to your computer’s web browser temporary files. The first two cookies just contain a user identifier (hereinafter "user-id") and an anonymous session identifier (hereinafter "session-id"), automatically assigned to you by the phpBB software. A third cookie will be created once you have browsed topics within the "FreeFileSync Forum" and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user experience.

We may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst browsing the "FreeFileSync Forum", though these are outside the scope of this section which is intended to only cover the pages created by the phpBB software. The second way in which we collect your information is by what you submit to us. This can be, and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user, registering on the "FreeFileSync Forum" (hereinafter "your account") and posts submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in (hereinafter "your posts").
