# Privacy Policy - Free WordPress Blog Setup - Free Blog Factory

This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal information for our services on our www.FreeBlogFactory.com Web site (this “Site”). Our company, Social Spin, collects information from all end users of our services (the “Products” and/or “Services”), those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts (“Visitors”), as well as those who may purchase Products and/or Services (“Members”). We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.

## Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used

Introduction: Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Services.

Registration: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Products or Services, including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member’s account (such as for billing purposes). However, we may disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to potential partners, our affiliates, and reputable third parties. We take all available measures to select affiliates and service providers that are ethical and provide similar privacy protection to their customers and the community. We do not make any representations about the practices and policies about these companies.

In instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name and phone number of persons who subscribe to the Services as a result of the joint promotion, for the purpose of offering you other products and services.

In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members).

Also, with purchases, we supply our Member’s contact information to our business partners, who then may contact the Member by telephone after the Member’s purchase. Sales proceeds are collected by the business partner’s company.

Special Cases: It is our company’s policy to use or share the personal information about Visitors or Members in ways described herein without additional notice or means to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Also, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and our Members.
