We at Freemake are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you share with us. Freemake has established this Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Freemake website [www.freemake.com](https://web.archive.org/)

## Information Collection

Freemake doesn’t collect any kind of personal information when you use our applications. 

We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you want to provide us with your personal data, to give us the opportunity to get in touch with you. 

If you choose to create an account on Help Desk to contact the Freemake Support Team, you enter your email address, name and surname, password, location. This data is not listed publicly. It is saved within the Help Desk program and is used by the technical support only to get in touch with you.

When you enter a contest or other promotional event, we may ask for information such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

We use Google Analytics (https://www.google.com/analytics) to track our website traffic. It is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your time spent at our sites, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our sites users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means, for instance, that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous. We do not use this information for any other purposes.

When a user submits personal information, it is kept on a private server not accessible from the Internet. This limits the possibility of any malicious use of your information. 

Credit Card Purchase: Freemake doesn't process credit card data itself. All payments are accepted through the payment service providers https://fastspring.com/ and https://www.paypal.com. Information about your credit card is not kept in or recorded by Freemake, it is simply passed through to the credit card company. In this respect, credit card purchase in the internet is like a credit card purchase at any store.

Such information as email address, name and surname, transaction ID, serial number are kept by Freemake or further delivery and/or registration of the product.

## Use of personal information

Freemake software does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Freemake behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against Freemake policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent. In short, Freemake does not sell registrant information to lists. In some cases, Freemake may use a visitor's personal information to understand overall patterns for site usage, to contact the user for clarification on inaccurate information, or to follow up on a customer service issue. Personal information may include name, address, telephone number, etc.
