# Privacy Policy

Freeview Australia Limited (ABN: 72 130 448 510) and its related companies (together we, us, our and other similar expressions) are committed to protecting your personal privacy.  This Privacy Policy tells you how we collect, store, use and disclose your personal information.  We encourage you to read this policy carefully so that you understand our information handling practices

In order to provide our customers with our products and services, we may collect and use personal information about you and others. If we are not provided with all the personal information we request, we may not be able to supply our products and services.

The type of information we collect includes names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and other contact details.  

If you use our FreeviewPlusTM service, we may also collect your IP address and postcode, although this information is collected on an anonymous basis – which means we do not match that information with personal information we may hold about you and we are not able to identify you from your IP address and postcode.

Generally, we collect an individual’s personal information from that individual.  For example we collect personal information when you enter a promotion or provide us with feedback or make a complaint through our website or other means of communication.

**How we store personal information**

We take all reasonable steps to keep secure any personal information which we hold about you and to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorised alteration. Any personal information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. Access to personal information is limited to those of our personnel who specifically need it to carry out their business responsibilities.
