**Information Collection and Use**

ConsumerInfo.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. ConsumerInfo.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

Our order forms ask customers to provide contact information (like their email and mailing addresses), unique identifiers (like their Social Security number), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and optional demographic information (like their age, or income level). We utilize this information in order to provide information, products, and services that are relevant and useful to the user. Contact information from order forms is used to fulfill orders and to send information about our company and our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary, such as to explain new or changed membership benifits. We also use these data to tailor visitors' experiences at our Web site, show content that might interest them, and display content in accordance with their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

Financial information that is collected is used for one or several of the following purposes: to check the users' qualifications, to offer financial services, and to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as Social Security numbers) are collected from Web site visitors to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system, and are not shared with third parties without the user's explicit permission. 

This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide some demographic information (such as income level and gender) but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

**Order Forms**

We request information from the user on our credit product order forms. Here you must provide contact information (like name, address, telephone, and email address), verification information (like a previous address and your mother's maiden name or another, similar password), unique identifiers (like your Social Security number and date of birth), and financial information (like your credit card number and expiration date). When you purchase one of our credit products online, the information you provide is used for authentication, fulfillment, and billing. We use your full name and current address, telephone number (in case we need to contact you due to a problem with your order), and a valid credit card number to process your order. If you are signing up for online delivery with the CreditCheck® Monitoring Service, we use your email address to deliver your membership number, follow up on your report requests and send occasional updates regarding your membership. For orders involving credit reports, we must use your Social Security number and date of birth to obtain your credit report for you. We ask for your previous address if you have moved within the last two years and your mother's maiden name so that we can verify your identity and address before delivering your credit report and when you call our Customer Service Department. If you opt to receive our free credit newsletter, you will receive it until you notify us that you no longer wish to receive it. 

While ordering a credit report, you may also have the option of requesting your personal credit score and/or "Your Offers" (information about financial products or services that may be of interest to you based on the information in your credit report). If you purchase your personal credit score, we will run the information in your credit report through a statistical scoring model to calculate your credit score. If you sign up for "Your Offers," ConsumerInfo.com will use the information in your credit report to match your credit history to credit and financial products and services you may be especially interested in, so that we can provide you with information about such products and services offered by our partners. These offers may be presented online at ConsumerInfo.com or sent via email, in our personalized monthly newsletter and/or through occasional other email contact. Anonymous, aggregate information about customers who match a particular offer may be provided to our partners, but no Personally Identifiable Information about you will be shared with our partners unless you respond to the offer and consequently provide it to them.

**Using Members-Only Services**

When using free information services in our Members-Only area, members may input address information to obtain home or neighborhood reports. This information is neither connected to the individual user nor stored by ConsumerInfo.com.   
  
Top

**Cookies and Third Party Advertisers**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. We do not use cookies on QSpace.Com. Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

ConsumerInfo.com works with third parties to serve ads on our websites. These ads may contain cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness and gather completely anonymous information. This policy only covers the use of cookies and action tags by ConsumerInfo.com on QSpace.Com and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. ConsumerInfo.com does not have control, nor access to the information contained in its advertisers' cookies. To find out more about how 24/7 manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on QSpace.com go to [www.247media.com](http://www.247media.com/?NETSCAPE_LIVEWIRE_ID=19D1D86BF157BE9CEABD0C6251CAADE4001ACDC1).

**Sharing**

Although unlikely, ConsumerInfo.com may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. 

Other companies that place advertising or content on our site may collect information about you through the use of cookies when you view or click on their advertising or content (using the same techniques as described above). Because of the way the Internet operates technically, we cannot control this collection of information--but we can control which companies are allowed to place such advertising on our site. As the consumer, you should contact these advertisers or content providers that place information on our site directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they potentially collect. Anyone placing advertising on our Web site can only collect anonymous information about you unless you actively provide personally identifiable information to them. 

We also encourage our co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one. We do not knowingly share any of your personal information with third parties without your permission. We may at times provide you with opportunities to receive information about additional products and services, in which case we will be acting as an infomediary (sending promotional materials on our partners' behalf) but we will never share your information with a third party unless you grant us explicit permission to do so. 

We use a credit card processing company to bill users for services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

In processing credit report orders, we request reports from credit reporting agencies, namely Equifax, Experian, Trans Union, and/or the merged report reseller, First American CREDCO. These credit bureaus receive information that we have collected solely for the purpose of providing you with the credit product you have requested. 

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as follows: 

**Agents** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Our information-handling agents include: 

  * **Responsys**

We use Responsys email solutions to communicate with customers who have chosen to receive e-mailings from us. Responsys does not use any of the information from our mailing lists except to send and process email communications on our behalf. Please [click here](http://www.responsys.com/corporate/policies/permission.asp) to read the Responsys statement on privacy and permissions marketing.

  * **Mediaplex**

MOJO Adserver delivers, aggregates and reports on clients' campaign performance enabling clients to analyze and optimize their online campaigns. Mediaplex does not collect or maintain any personally identifiable user information. Any re-marketing or other use of this data by Mediaplex requires the explicit, written approval of client.

  * **Advertising.com**

Advertising.com serves our ads on the Internet for some of our marketing tests. Advertising.com tracks aggregate information regarding ad impressions and hits to pages. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

  * **DoubleClick**

DoubleClick serves our ads on the Internet for some of our marketing tests. DoubleClick tracks aggregate information regarding ad impressions and hits to pages. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.


**Promotional Offers**   
Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of ConsumerInfo.com customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. Each promotional offer sent on behalf of ConsumerInfo.com provides our users with easy access to opt out of future promotional offers. 

**Business Transfers**   
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ConsumerInfo.com, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. Please view “Notice of Changes” to understand what options members have. 

**Protection of ConsumerInfo.com and Others**   
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ConsumerInfo.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

**With Your Consent**   
Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites operated by ConsumerInfo.com as well as links to other sites that we do not control. We at ConsumerInfo.com are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

In some of our Web pages there are automatic links (redirect code) that send users to different ConsumerInfo.com sites or offers we believe will be of interest to you based on the page you have been visiting. You can always return to the original page by using your browser's "back" button.

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both on- and off-line. 

All collected credit information is moved to a secure computer by means of a one-way transfer on our proprietary network. This computer has no connections to modems or the Internet and cannot be accessed from outside of our physical facility by anyone, even one of our employees. So you can be confident that your credit card number and identifying information are safely and securely stored. When one of our order forms asks you to enter sensitive information (such as your credit card number and/or Social Security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry--SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing." While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. 

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [CustServ@ConsumerInfo.Com](mailto:CustServ@ConsumerInfo.Com).

**Special Offers**

From time to time our site may request information from users via surveys, contests, or special offers. Participation in these surveys, contests or offers is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special offers, or a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

**Notification of Changes**

If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

**Correcting/Updating Personal Information**

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as an address) you can update it by calling our Customer Care Center toll-free at 1-888-888-8553.   
  
Top

**Choice/Opt-Out**

Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an opt-out mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Because we want our users to feel completely comfortable using ConsumerInfo.com's services, we provide you with various opportunities to control how the information you provide to us is used. This site gives you the option to cancel our service and not receive future communications from us, to direct that we not share your information with third parties (in cases where you previously granted us permission to share such information--we do not share users' personal information with third parties without their permission), and to change your profile information. 

Users who no longer wish to receive email newsletters or promotional materials from our partners or us may opt out of receiving these communications by emailing us at [optouts@consumerinfo.com](mailto:optouts@consumerinfo.com).
