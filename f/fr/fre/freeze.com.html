<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
<p class="MsoNormal">Freeze.com, LLC (“Freeze”) is committed to
safeguarding your
privacy online and respects the privacy of its customers and the users
of this
website and the services provided by Freeze.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) discloses how we collect
and use
information, and the choices that you can make about the way your
information
is collected and used.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the many services that Freeze
provides
throughout the Freeze network of affiliated companies, Freeze delivers
advertisements,
promotions and offers by e-mail and through its screensavers to its
members and
subscribers who have opted-in to receive such messages, either directly
through
Freeze, or through one of our partners or affiliates (the “Service”).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Freeze is committed to providing you with
relevant and timely offers catered to your specific interests that you
want to
receive, in addition to allowing us to continue to provide you with the
latest
in screensaver, wallpaper and desktop enhancement technology.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freeze is dedicated to following only responsible
and
ethical e-mail practices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Freeze takes
an aggressive stance against unsolicited commercial e-mail and is
continually
updating its policies and procedures to comply with the Can-Spam Act of
2003.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that regard, we know that
just because you opted-in to receive Freeze messages or downloaded a
screensaver, you may want to discontinue future e-mail offers and
promotions
from Freeze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can remove yourself
from any or all of our lists and offers at any time by following the
simple
instructions at support.freeze.com.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Additionally, every e-mail that Freeze sends to its members and
subscribers contains a working unsubscribe link prominently displayed
at the
bottom of each e-mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By clicking on
such link, you will be automatically removed from future Freeze offers
and
promotions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, if a Freeze
advertiser provides Freeze a link to the advertiser’s internal e-mail
suppression list, Freeze will provide this link to you with our offer
delivery
so that you may choose to remove yourself from a specific offer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For more information on our commitment
against unsolicited commercial e-mail, please see our E Mail Best
Practices
Policy at <a href="http://www.freeze.com/snow/info/bestpractices.shtml">http://www.freeze.com/snow/info/bestpractices.shtml</a>.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freeze is committed to making your use of <a href="http://www.freeze.com/">www.freeze.com</a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>and
<a href="http://www.screensaver.com/">www.screensaver.com</a>
(collectively the “Site”) as easy and enjoyable as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please take a moment to read the following
Privacy Policy to determine how you personal information will be
treated as you
make full use of our many offerings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
using the Site and/or the Service, or providing the information
requested by
the Site and/or Service, or by continuing to use the Site and/or
Service after
having an opportunity to review this Privacy Policy, you agree to
accept the
terms of our Privacy Policy and Freeze’s use of the information it
collects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you do not agree to the
terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or participate
in the
Service.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freeze reserves the right to modify this Privacy
Policy at
any time without giving you prior notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your use of the Site or the Service following any such
modification
constitutes your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy as
modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last date this Privacy
Policy was
revised or modified is set forth below (“Effective Date”).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
personally identifiable information does Freeze collect from me?<o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freeze collects information in several ways from
affiliates
and different parts of our network of web sites. Some personal
information is
gathered when you register. During registration, Freeze will require
your
e-mail address in order to use the Service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Freeze will also require your name, date of birth, zip code,
country and
gender in order to provide the Service, although this information may
not
necessarily be collected by Freeze upon completion of the registration
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, Freeze may
request, but does not require, your credit card number and/or social
security
number, as well as personal interests in order to provide the Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more information you volunteer (and the
more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your
experience and
the Service that you receive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
always, you can simply view the Site without registering for a
membership or
subscribing to portions of the Service without being required to
provide any
personal information, except that which is necessary to accommodate
your
request.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to registration we may ask you for
personal
information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you
request
access to our entertainment or computer utilities offerings, etc., or
agree to
download our content for your use. If you contact Freeze, we may keep a
record
of that correspondence. Freeze also occasionally asks users to complete
surveys
that we use for research purposes. Wherever Freeze collects personal
information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy
on that
specified page.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What are
cookies
and how does Freeze use them?<o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As part of offering and providing customizable and
personalized services, Freeze uses cookies to store and sometimes track
information about you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cookie is a
small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and
stored
on your computer's hard drive. Any Site which asks you to log-in or
that are
customizable require that you accept cookies. (See "<i>What are my
choices
regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?</i>" for
more information on cookies.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Generally, Freeze uses cookies to:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your
account
information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a
better and
more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or
"Login" and is modified when you “Customize” or "Logout” of our
services. Freeze also uses cookies to store your zip code and other
information
you have submitted for other services, such as displaying your local
weather.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser
accessing
Freeze is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the
extent of
repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered
user, and to
help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(3) Assist affiliates and merchants associated
with Freeze
to track visits to and business at their sites and stores, and to
process the
items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is
sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may
also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(4) Measure certain traffic patterns, for example
areas of
Freeze's network of Sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns
in the
aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are
similar
or different from one another so that we can make each new experience
on a
Freeze Site a better one. We may use this information to better
personalize the
content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on
our
sites.</p>
Advertisers that serve ads onto Freeze may also use their
own cookies.
<p class="MsoNormal">Freeze also collects IP addresses for system
administration
and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In addition,
Freeze
Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How does
Freeze use my information?<o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freeze's primary goal in collecting personal
information is
to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network
of Sites
and through our partners. This includes personalization services,
interactive
communications, online shopping and many other types of services, most
of which
are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of
charge, we
display advertisements and encourage your participation in opt-in
mailings. By
knowing a little about you, Freeze is able to deliver more relevant
advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In our role of delivering targeted advertisements,
Freeze
plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us
the type
of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old).
Freeze
takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria.
In this
process, the advertiser never has access to individual user
information. Only
Freeze has access to individuals' user information. This kind of
advertisement
targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through
Freeze
and its affiliates. You will only receive special offers via email from
Freeze
if you have indicated in your account preferences, or at some other
time, that
you would like to receive them. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freeze does research on our users' demographics,
interests,
and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration,
during
a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to
better
understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed
on an
aggregated basis. Freeze may share this aggregated data with
advertisers or
business partners.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As Freeze develops, we may buy other businesses or
their
assets or sell our business assets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Customer information is generally one of the business assets
involved in
such transactions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the event
that Freeze or all of its assets are acquired, customer information,
including
any visitor information collected through the Site or the Service,
would be one
of the transferred assets.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Freeze reserves the right to disclose collected
information
in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
information is necessary to identify, contract or bring legal action
against
someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either
intentionally
or unintentionally) Freeze’s rights or property, other visitors,
subscribers,
members or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Freeze also reserves the right to disclose
visitor, member or subscriber information when we believe in good faith
that
the law requires it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>IV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who is
collecting information?<o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you are on a Site and are asked for personal
information, you are sharing that information with Freeze alone, unless
it is
specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy or in an offer
form or
registration form that you may be asked to complete as part of
utilizing the
Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, some Services, like
Freeze Wireless, are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In
order to
provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share
your
personal information with our partner company. If data is being
collected
and/or maintained by any company other than Freeze, you will be
notified prior
to the time of the data collection or transfer either in this Privacy
Policy or
in an offer form or registration form that you will be asked to
complete as
part of utilizing the Service. If you do not want your data to be
shared, you
can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular
service. <b><o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Promotions that run on Freeze may be sponsored by
companies
other than Freeze or may be co-sponsored by Freeze and another company.
Some or
all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor of
that
promotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can decide not to
participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.
Currently, most Freeze promotions are limited to U.S. or North American
residents.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Please be aware that Freeze partners, sponsors
advertisers,
and web sites that have links on our site may collect personally
identifiable
information about you. The information practices of those Internet
access
partners, advertisers, and web sites linked from Freeze are not covered
by this
Privacy Policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Freeze has no liability
or responsibility for these independent policies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>V.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With whom does
Freeze share my information?<o:p></o:p></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Except as otherwise set forth in the Privacy
Policy, Freeze
will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information
except when
you have decided to opt-in to receive information, we have your
permission or
under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that
the law
requires it or under the circumstances described below. The following
describes
some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><u>Business
Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Freeze may
disclose your personal information to trusted business partners or
sponsors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some or all data collected
during
a Freeze promotion may be shared with a sponsor or business partner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If personally identifying information about
you such as your name, mailing address, phone number or any financial
information such as a credit card number about you will be shared
(assuming we
have it), we will tell you before we collect or transfer that data
during the
registration, offer and/or installation portion of providing the
Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This may occur, for example, by
engaging in
the Service, or if you download Freeze screensavers or other content,
Freeze
Software, or third party software.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
downloading software from a Freeze business partner or sponsor, you
specifically consent to the transfer of the personally identifiable
information
to and/or by such entity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Our trusted business
partners and
sponsors will change from time to time, and therefore it is not
possible to
provide an exhaustive list of our sponsors and business partners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, some of the trusted business
