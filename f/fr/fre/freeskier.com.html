<p>Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. Because 
we gather certain types of information about the users of Freeskier.com, we 
feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the 
capture and use of that information. This privacy statement (this 
"Statement") discloses the privacy practices for Freeskier.com (the 
"Website") - what information we gather, how we use it and how to correct 
or change it. This Statement only addresses our activities from our 
servers. Other sites may have their own 
privacy policies and practices, which we do not control. Questions 
regarding this Statement should be emailed to privacy@Freeskier.com </p>

<p><b><font size="3">General Privacy Information</font></b><br>
Freeskier.com's network of sites contain links to partners, advertisers and 
third party Internet sites and services who may collect data in connection 
with sweepstakes, promotions, e-commerce, etc. They each have separate 
privacy and data collection practices, independent of Freeskier.com and 
Freeskier.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent 
policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the 
content of such Web sites. Please keep in mind that whenever you 
voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information on any online 
service or Web site - for example on message boards, through email, or in 
chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In 
short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the 
public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 
Further, while we strive to protect your personal information, 
Freeskier.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you 
transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. You are solely responsible 
for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account 
information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.</p> 

<p><b><font size="3">Use of Information</font></b><br>
All of the information Freeskier.com collects, both what you tell us and 
what we collect through the use of cookies, is "aggregated" -- meaning that 
the information from many users is grouped together in a way that does not 
disclose the personal information of any particular user. We may use this 
aggregated information to evaluate which products and services are 
successful and which ones are not, and in order to evaluate which new 
services we should make available on our Web site. We may use only the 
anonymous click stream data to help our advertisers deliver better-targeted 
advertisements. Freeskier.com will not disclose any information about any 
individual without the individual's consent, except to comply with 
applicable law or valid legal process. There may be cases in which some of 
your personal information may be used by Freeskier.com to target e-commerce 
promotions and telemarketing activities. In addition, it may be shared with 
Third Parties who assist Freeskier.com in producing its Web sites or 
provide a service to Freeskier.com's users.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Contacting the Web Site</font></b><br>
If you have any questions about this Statement, the practices of 
Freeskier.com with respect to personal information or your dealings with 
this Web site, you can contact the Site Administrator or write to:<br>
Customer Service<br>
Freeskier.com, Inc.<br>
Attn.: Privacy Statement<br>
1630-A 30th St. #272<br>
Boulder, CO 80301<br>
Fax 303.449.2427</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Registration</font></b><br>
Anyone who participates in interactive activities (contests, store and 
online subscriptions) on Freeskier.com may be asked to register for a free 
guest ID and password or to complete subscription registration for a member 
ID and password. We use customer contact information from this registration 
form to send the user information about our company and promotional 
material from some of our partners. Financial information that is collected 
is used to bill the user for products and services. The customer's contact 
information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary for customer 
service reasons. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings by 
contacting the Site Administrator. Unique identifiers, such as ID and 
passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as 
account numbers in our record system.</p>


<p><b><font size="3">Cookies</font></b><br>
A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard 
drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a 
user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only 
personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply 
yourself. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user 
that has no meaning outside the assigning site. A cookie can't read data 
off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This random 
number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific 
things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who 
those customers are. We also use cookies to keep track of your shopping 
cart and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We use cookies 
to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your member ID. 
Additionally, after you've entered your member ID and password during a 
session on our service, we save that information so you don't have to 
reenter it repeatedly during that session.</p>

<p>Users should be aware that Freeskier.com cannot control the use of 
cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties 
hosting data for Freeskier.com. If a user does not want information 
collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most 
browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; 
however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the 
user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) 
available on Freeskier.com.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Order Forms</font></b><br>
Freeskier.com uses an order form for customers to purchase products and 
services. If you place an order on Freeskier.com we will collect 
information from you, including your credit card and contact information. 
This information will be used by Freeskier.com to bill the user for 
products and services. Contact information from the order form will also be 
used to ship orders, to contact a user for customer service related issues, 
and to send the user information about our company, and on occasion, 
promotional material from some of our partners. Users may opt out of 
receiving future mailings by contacting the Site Administrator.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Surveys</font></b><br>
Our online surveys ask visitors for their email address and demographic 
information. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We 
use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them 
content and promotional offers that we think they might be interested in, 
and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information 
is shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis. We may use contact 
data from our surveys to send the user information about our company and 
promotional material from Freeskier.com or some of our partners. Users may 
opt out of receiving future mailings by contacting the Site 
Administrator.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Contests</font></b><br>
We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for Freeskier.com ID 
and password. We use contact data from our contests to send users 
information about upcoming contests and promotional offers. On occasion we 
will email customers promotional material from some of our partners. The 
customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when 
necessary for winner notification and prize delivery confirmation. The 
majority of the contests that we offer are hosted on the Freeskier site; 
however, there may be cases in which a third party sponsor will host the 
contest and collect user information. In those cases, we urge users to 
review the privacy statement of the third party site. Users may opt out of 
receiving future mailings by contacting the Site Administrator.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Newsletter</font></b><br>
We offer a number of free newsletters to share content information about 
our site with interested users. Users may cancel their free email 
subscriptions by following the simple instructions at the bottom of each 
newsletter or email.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Security</font></b><br>
Freeskier.com utilizes a variety of security measures to maintain the 
safety of your personal information. All user contact information is 
accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights 
to production systems. Passwords and credit card numbers are encrypted in 
Freeskier.com's secure database, which is also located behind a firewall. 
All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via 
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted in Freeskier.com's 
databases as stated above.</p>

<p>If you choose to modify your personal information, you may do so by 
visiting the Customer Service page. Users will be required to submit a 
valid user ID and password for authentication before you will be able to 
modify your file. If you have forgotten your password or prefer to speak 
with a customer service representative to modify your personal information, 
you may contact customer service at (303) 449-2165. You will be asked to 
provide your name or user ID and then to verify certain non-sensitive 
information (i.e. mother's maiden name) in order to proceed. Because 
password and credit card information has been encrypted, it is completely 
invisible to any employee who accesses it, including our customer service 
team. If you desire to change your password, the customer service 
representative will reset to a new one after you have properly identified 
yourself.</p>

<p>Freeskier.com's technology department conducts frequent site 
security.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Personal Options</font></b><br>
You have the following options to deactivate your information from 
Freeskier.com's database. This will cease deployment of future 
communications and/or Freeskier.com's services. <br>
1. You can send an email to the Site Administrator.<br>
2. You can contact customer service at 303.449.2165.<br>
3. You can change your personal options.</p>

<p>WARNING: Deactivating your account will result in the loss of access to 
Members-Only areas.</p>

<p><b><font size="3">Change/Modify</font></b><br>
You also have the option of changing and modifying information previously 
provided. You can edit your Freeskier.com registered user information at 
anytime by visiting the Customer Service page.</p>  </td>
