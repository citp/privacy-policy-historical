<span class="InfoSubTitle">Information that we collect</span><br><br>

FreeSharewareDepot may collect information from its users in three different ways: 
<ul>
<li>Directly from the user.</li>
<li>Information from traffic references of hosting servers.</li>
<li>Information from cookies.</li>
</ul>


<strong>Information provided directly by the user:</strong> when you subscribe to a service provided by FreeSharewareDepot, we may ask you about your name and e-mail address. For example, when you fill the contact form, you need to enter your name and valid e-mail address.<br><br> 

<strong>Information from traffic references:</strong> when you visit a website, you unveil certain information about you, such as your IP address, time of visit, place from which you accessed our website. FreeSharewareDepot, like other operators, stores this information.<br><br> 

<strong>Information from cookies: </strong>FreeSharewareDepot allows other companies, called third-party ad networks or payment registration services such as  Google Adsense <a title="Google Adsense Privacy Policy" href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/" rel="nofollow">Google Adsense Privacy Policy</a> and RegNow Software Registration Services <a title="RegNow Privacy Policy" href="http://corporate.digitalriver.com/store/digriv/Corp/sectionName.company/subSectionName.corpPolicies/page.corpPolicies#privacy" rel="nofollow">RegNow Privacy Policy</a>, to serve advertisements or software purchase within the FreeSharewareDepot site. These third-party companies use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the FreeSharewareDepot site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.<br><br> 

FreeSharewareDepot does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks FreeSharewareDepot to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the FreeSharewareDepot Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.<br><br> 


You need to acknowledge that, whenever you disclose information in public areas on the website, such as message boards comments, that information becomes public and can easily be tracked and used by unauthorized persons. Although FreeSharewareDepot does its best in order to protect your personal data, we cannot entirely grant you its safety. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. You should also know that you are the only one responsible for keeping the secret of your passwords, usernames etc.<br><br><br>

<span class="InfoSubTitle">Notification of Changes</span><br><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.
