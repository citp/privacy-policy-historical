# Freddie Mac Terms and Conditions: Privacy Policy

Freddie Mac recognizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of your nonpublic personally identifiable information. We are committed to privacy practices that protect the confidentiality and security of this information. Our practices for dealing with this information that you enter or that we collect exclusively through your use of this website are set forth below. This privacy policy does not apply to information we may receive from or about you in other ways. It also does not apply to information collected by third parties through websites that link to or from this website.

## **Information We Collect**

If you visit this website to read or download information, we collect and store: the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (such as aol.com); the Internet protocol address of the host server you are using (such as ww3.aol.com); the name and version of your Web browser (such as Netscape 4.0); the date and time you access this website; and, if you came to us through a link from some other website, the Internet address of the website from which you linked to us. We do not collect your name or email address. No information we collect in this way is traceable back to a specific person. 

We use this information for general statistical modeling, in order to measure the number of visitors to different pages on the website and to modify the website in order to make it more helpful. We also use this information to monitor network traffic and to identify unauthorized access or unusual activity on the website. We do not sell this information to third party companies. 

Some parts of this website may use a "cookie," which is a small text file that is placed on your computer's hard drive. The cookie captures no personally identifiable information. This website may use a cookie in order to log which pages you visit on the website or to provide certain features during your visit to the website. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies; however, some features of the website may not function properly if you do this.

## **Information You Provide**

If you send us an email or message and provide your name or other personal information, we may keep this information. We may use this information to send an answer to your question or to deliver the requested information or service to you. We may use this information to provide you with information in which we believe you will be interested; however, at any time, you may request that we stop doing this by contacting us in the manner described in the “How to Reach Us” section of this policy. We also may use information that you provide to measure general statistics about visits to this website and interest in particular areas, or otherwise to enhance the website. We do not sell this information to third parties. We may disclose information from or about website visitors to third parties, such as contractors, consultants and other service providers, so that the third party can perform a business, professional or technical support function for you, the website or Freddie Mac. We also may disclose this information as required by applicable law or regulation, such as to respond to a subpoena or other judicial process or to comply with requests from our regulators.

By sending an email or making a request or inquiry, you agree to permit Freddie Mac to keep and use the information you have given us consistent with this policy. 

If you enter information into a financing or affordability calculator offered on this website – such as income, the down payment you want to make, the length of a loan you want, the price of a home you have in mind – that information is not seen or received by Freddie Mac. The calculator's functions are performed by your computer and the results are displayed in your browser and viewable only by you.

## **Business Users**

This policy (other than this section entitled “Business Users”) does not apply to information provided to us by business entities, even if the information is transmitted to us through this website. If you are a business user and you use this website or any of our business applications in the course of business with Freddie Mac, then information that you submit may be used and disclosed in the same ways as information that we receive outside of this website. We will use this information only in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and any applicable agreements between our companies. 

## **Security**

Freddie Mac has adopted policies and practices designed to protect the security and confidentiality of any nonpublic personally identifiable information received through this website, to protect against anticipated threats and hazards to security and integrity of the information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of the information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience. Freddie Mac uses a variety of security measures to protect the transmission of information submitted to us through this website. Although Freddie Mac strives to maintain a high standard of security and privacy, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and Freddie Mac makes no such warranty or guarantee. 

## **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to revise or change this policy in the future. Any changes to the policy will be posted on this section of the website. Please check this policy periodically for any changes. When the policy is updated, the date of the update will appear at the bottom of this page. 

## **How to Reach Us**
