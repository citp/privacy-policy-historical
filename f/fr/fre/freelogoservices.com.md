### V. Sharing of Personal Data & Accountability for Onward Transfer

  1. Personal Data Disclosures

There are a variety of circumstances where we may need to disclose Personal Data to:

    * A person who, in the reasonable judgment of Deluxe is seeking the information as your agent. For example, we may provide information about your account to your legal representative if we are satisfied that that individual is requesting the information on your behalf;

    * Our parent company or affiliates to help us serve you better and provide you with requested services;

    * A company or individual employed by us to perform functions on our behalf, such as support services, order processing/fulfillment, information technology development and support, customer service or data processing, and are authorized to use your Personal Data only as necessary to provide these services to us; and,

We will share randomized, aggregated demographic information about our users with third parties. This information cannot identify any individual person. Deluxe may also disclose your Personal Data to any other third party with your prior consent.

Additionally, Deluxe may share your Personal Data, without your prior consent, for the limited purposes noted below:

  2. Subprocessors/Third Party Service Providers

To provide and market our services, Deluxe uses subprocessors to perform functions such as:

    * Technical Infrastructure
    * Marketing & Analytics
    * Order processing/Fulfillment & Support
    * Credit and payment Card Transactions 

We only share Personal Data with third party service providers to the extent necessary to provide the requested services. These companies are prohibited from retaining, sharing, storing or using the Personal Data for any secondary purposes. By contract, we hold our third-party service providers accountable for the privacy and security of Personal Data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and applicable laws and regulations. In such cases of onward transfer, we maintain liability for your Personal Data under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks.

You have the choice to limit the use and disclosure of your Personal Data. If you choose to limit the data to be used, simply do not disclose that information to Deluxe or use the Site. In certain cases, limiting the use and disclosure of your Personal Data may impact functionality or prevent the use of Deluxe’s products or services. When Deluxe does share your Personal Data with third party service providers and/or subprocessors, Deluxe will:

      1. transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes;

      2. ascertain that the subprocessor is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by these Principles;

      3. take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the subprocessor effectively processes the Personal Data transferred in a manner consistent with the organization’s obligations under these Principles;

      4. require the subprocessor to notify Deluxe if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by these Principles;

      5. upon notice, including under (iv), take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and

      6. provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that subprocessor to the Department of Commerce upon request.

Deluxe shall remain liable under the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer if its subprocessors process your Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Deluxe proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

  3. Legal Obligations

We cooperate with government or law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with laws applicable to our services.
