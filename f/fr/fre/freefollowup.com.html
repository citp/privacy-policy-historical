<p>The privacy of our visitors to is FreeFollowup.com important to us.</p>
<p>At FreeFollowup.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information
is important. Here is information on what types of personal information
we receive and collect when you use and visit FreeFollowup.com, and how we
safeguard your information.&nbsp; We never sell your personal information to
third parties.</p>
<p>Log Files<br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in
log files.&nbsp; The information in the log files include&nbsp; your IP (internet
protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or
Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet
Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you
visited throughout our site.</p>
<p>Cookies and Web Beacons<br>
We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal
preferences when you visit our site.&nbsp; This could include only showing
you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our
features, such as forums.</p>
<p>We also use third party advertisements on FreeFollowup.com to support our
site.&nbsp; Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and
web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these
advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program)
information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used
to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash
installed.&nbsp; This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing
New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or
showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing
cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>
<p>DoubleClick DART cookies<br>
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s
DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are
browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising
(including some Google AdSense advertisements).&nbsp; This cookie is used to
serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based
targeting”).&nbsp; The ads served will be targeted based on your previous
browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about
visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when
viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).&nbsp; DART uses
“non personally identifiable information”.&nbsp; It does NOT track personal
information about you, such as your name, email address, physical
address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account
numbers or credit card numbers.&nbsp; You can opt-out of this ad serving on
all sites using this advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or
third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing
preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; However,
this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as
other websites.&nbsp; This could include the inability to login to services
or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>
<p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any
advertising program.&nbsp; Unless you have settings that disallow cookies,
the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie
will be added.</p>
