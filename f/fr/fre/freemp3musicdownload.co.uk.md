# Privacy Policy - Free MP3 Music Download

At http://www.freemp3musicdownload.co.uk, we pride ourselves on not taking your personal information and using it for other than its intended uses. With that being said, there are certain pieces of information that we do collect. Any person that becomes a member is acknowledging that they have read the privacy page and understand what may be collected, thus taking blame away from the website and its owner for any type of data that is collected.

Mobile Numbers  
During the verification process the mobile number of the interested party is taken and this is filled within the system. This is to allow for easier access to the site once they are verified and have become a member. During no time do we release these mobile numbers to collection agencies, sales personnel, etc. If someone is found to be violating the terms and conditions that are set forth for using the website, their mobile number may be released to the proper authorities should the situation come to this.

The mobile number is also collected as a reference to find out who is using the sites and from where the person is located. There is no time that anyone claiming to be from the website will use this number to get in contact with you. We do respect your privacy and make sure that these mobile phone numbers do not fall into the hands of anyone that would abuse this information.

Cookies  
Our site does use cookies for each computer browser that enters into our site in order to offer members convenience of signing in. With the use of the cookies, the person does not have to enter their information each and every time the site is accessed from that particular computer and particular browser. Not using cookies could damage the running of the site for the user, thus the person should allow these to be used when they are visiting the site.

Username  
Those that enter into the site are going to use their mobile phone number as their username. We will then send a password to their mobile phone device for full access. If the person forgets their log in information, such as the password, this is delivered to them via email and sent to the address that they specify when signing up.

IP Address  
We do collect IP addresses that enter into our site. The IP address helps us to confirm that the person is in the right location to allow them access to the site. There are no other times in which the IP address is used besides the initial log in page to verify your location each and every time that the person does log onto the site.

Manual Verification  
For those that use manual verification in order to accuse the site, they should be aware that their mobile number, email address, password and country are stored into the website. Those that do not use the manual verification process, but use the form provided on the website, are not going to have this information stored about them. Those that are not wanting this personal information stored should use the form online to become verified.

Under no circumstances will we release any of the information that is stored about the user as our main priorities are to provide free MP3 music to listeners, without worrying about their personal information being leaked and abused for financial gain.

At any time we can change the privacy, and terms and conditions without informing the member.
