Free CSS.com can be used without the provision of personal information. If and when personal data is required when using the Free CSS website (e.g name, address, email or phone number etc.) the provision of personal data is carried out on a voluntary basis and is the sole decision of the user to submit their persoanl data.

Any personal data that is sent to us via the Free CSS website (via forms or direct email), is in no means disclosed to third parties without explicit consent from the person who sent us the information. If legally bound to, we may disclose information you have provided to law enforcement officials or government agencies.

Your data privacy is taken seriously by us, all information that you may provide is treated confidentially and in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation.

**Handling of Personal Data**

**Server Logs**

Our hosting provider collects website access data and saves the data in "server log files", the following (known) data is written to the log files:

  * IP address
  * Browser type
  * Operating system
  * Server access on/when
  * Amount of data sent
  * Referrer URL
  * Computer host name



The data is used for statistical purposes only, but, Free CSS reserves the right in retrospective effect to check server log files should evidence be available that indicates illegal / unlawful use of the Free CSS website.

Our provider stores Log Files for a maximum of 9 weeks, after this time the files are permanently deleted from the server.

IP addresses that are in the log files are anonymised by our provider after a period of 7 days, this is to our knowledge, automated. The anonymisation ensures the process of identifying a natural person via the IP address is not possible.

**Social Media Links**

We have multiple links in our website to a variety of social media platforms. These links are ther for the end-user to use to add pages they like to their social media platform of choice.

All of the links are controlled by us and none of them send personal data when clicked. The social media platforms that we link to probably use user tracking, which will let them know where you have come from after landing on their website, the data that is collected by the social media platform has nothing to do with us and we can not prevent it.
