_Effective: 07/16/2013_

FreeTaxUSA treats your financial and personally identifiable information as confidential and will not sell or rent any information. FreeTaxUSA has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with [TRUSTe's program requirements](http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html) including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personally identifiable information. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this website, [www.FreeTaxUSA.com](https://web.archive.org/index.jsp). TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy Trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy statement or practices, please contact us at [webmaster@FreeTaxUSA.com](mailto:webmaster@freetaxusa.com).

Information Collection and Use

FreeTaxUSA is the sole owner of the information collected on [www.FreeTaxUSA.com](https://web.archive.org/index.jsp). Information is collected in order for taxpayers to prepare and electronically file their tax returns. Tax return information is only disclosed to appropriate government and financial institutions in order to file tax returns and comply with Internal Revenue Service requirements. The data collected includes everything that is needed to prepare a tax return, such as names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, mailing address, email address, and any tax-related information (e.g. W-2s and 1099 forms). If a purchase is made, credit card information for a credit card payment or bank account information for an e-check payment will be gathered.

All personally identifiable information gathered during account creation and during the use of the application to prepare taxes is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

At times, we may offer a referral service so that you can tell a friend about our products. We will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. FreeTaxUSA stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at [webmaster@FreeTaxUSA.com](mailto:webmaster@freetaxusa.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

Tracking Technologies / Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the FreeTaxUSA website. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on our site. A session ID cookie is used as an additional layer of security to maintain your session while you are signed in to your account. Once a user closes the browser or clicks the Sign Out link, the cookie simply terminates. We set a persistent cookie to store information about how you got to our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Cookies are also used to track affiliate referrals and when collecting analytical data about usage on our site or the effectiveness of our emails. Third party cookies, or web beacons, are used to anonymously track the effectiveness of advertising and to display our ads through ad networks. This information is used in aggregate and does not contain personally identifiable information. The use of cookies by our tracking utility and ad service providers are not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

We may use clear-gifs/web beacons in our HTML-based emails to monitor the effectiveness of our communication efforts. Links within email may contain campaign tracking codes to measure traffic. When you click on a link in an email or open an HTML email that includes a web beacon, we record these individual responses to allow us to customize our offerings to you.

Our third party tracking utility provider employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

We partner with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this site and to provide you targeted advertising based upon your use of this site. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

Third-Party Advertising

No third-party advertising appears on the FreeTaxUSA website.

Usage Information

Like most websites, FreeTaxUSA uses log files and analytical software to track website usage. The information collected may include IP addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform types, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for use in improving the site.

Contests and Giveaways

Contests and giveaways have their own terms and conditions and should be referenced before entering.

Communications from FreeTaxUSA

Your contact information (email address) may be used to keep you updated on the status of your return, remind you of important dates on the tax calendar, resolve any problems with transmission of your tax return, and provide a confirmation of credit card or direct-debit payments. If you e-file your tax return, an email will be sent to you stating whether the IRS has accepted or rejected your e-filed tax return. If problems occur with the transmission of your tax return, a customer support email may be sent out to explain the problem. FreeTaxUSA also sends a confirmation email to serve as a receipt when a taxpayer uses a credit card or checking/savings account to pay for the FreeTaxUSA fee.

FreeTaxUSA will not use your information to market any third party product or service. Occasionally, FreeTaxUSA will send out tax information or promotional material dealing with our products. These are considered optional communications and you as the recipient can specify whether or not you wish to receive this type of communication. This can be done while creating your account, by using the Edit User Profile portion of the application after signing in, by clicking on the "Update Email Preferences" link in the footer of every optional email or by following the instructions found at the following link: [http://www.FreeTaxUSA.com/subscriptions.jsp](https://web.archive.org/subscriptions.jsp).

Service Announcements

On rare occasions, it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, FreeTaxUSA might send users a notification via email.

Customer Service

Customer support for FreeTaxUSA is provided through our tax application or email. When a customer support request is received, we will reply via the customer support portion of the application or email. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire to use our service, you may correct, update or delete it by signing in to your account and making any changes. However, once the IRS accepts your e-filed tax return, no changes can be made to your account that would change any of the information on the tax return.

We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Legal Disclosures

Though every effort is made to preserve user privacy, FreeTaxUSA may need to disclose personally identifiable information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.

Credit Card Processing

If during the use of our application you order a product that requires payment, your credit card or direct-debit payment will be processed by a payment processing company. The payment processing companies that we use do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. No credit card information will be collected unless there is a payment due. Your credit card data is only used to process your payment.

Business Transitions

In the event FreeTaxUSA goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, the personally identifiable information of users will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified, via email and/or through a prominent notice on the FreeTaxUSA website, 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personally identifiable information. If as a result of the business transition, the personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given a choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

Security

FreeTaxUSA maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable law and federal standards. When users submit sensitive information via the website, it is protected both online and offline. FreeTaxUSA uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to protect all sensitive information. SSL technology is the most commonly-used method on the Internet to safely transmit data. Access to your personally identifiable information is protected by a password, of your choosing, in order to maintain security for your account. Only you, or someone with whom you share your password, can access your account to make changes to your return or account information.

Along with using SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take great care to protect user information offline. The FreeTaxUSA servers are located in a secure data storage facility with strict security measures and procedures in place. All user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to only key employees who need the information to perform a specific job function (Example: the customer service manager). Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on the security and privacy practices of FreeTaxUSA. Before every tax season, as well as any time new policies are added, employees of FreeTaxUSA are notified and/or reminded about the importance placed on privacy, and what they can do to ensure the security of user information.

If you have any further questions about the security at FreeTaxUSA, you can send an email to [webmaster@FreeTaxUSA.com](mailto:webmaster@freetaxusa.com). No support questions will be answered from this email address.

If you submit personally identifiable information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.

Social Media Widgets

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it.

Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and there may be other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
