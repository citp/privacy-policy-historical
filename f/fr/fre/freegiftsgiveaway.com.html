<p>Last Updated: 15 April 2008</p>
<p>AECNU Internet &amp; Computers strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of  Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.  We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address,  street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.  We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third  party. Period."</p>
<p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p></p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,  the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For  example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to  certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or  when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in  sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive  areas of our site. Like most Web sites, AECNU Internet &amp; Computers also collects  information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be  transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet  Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information  from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and  password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you  visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular  advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may  also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose  not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to  refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain  portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password,  and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your  preferences.</p>
<p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p></p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and  deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and  do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you)  may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your  usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help  enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or  what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be  shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does  not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to  identify you individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on AECNU Internet &amp; Computers to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by AECNU Internet &amp; Computers and other topics we think you might find of interest.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by AECNU Internet &amp; Computers may  also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site  administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions,  administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.  Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our  site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will  use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as  we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with  other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be  among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response  to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to  do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us,  and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or  necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in  such cases.</p>
<p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p></p>
<p>AECNU Internet &amp; Computers expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to  respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties,  including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers  accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection  policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link  to, or view as part of a frame on a AECNU Internet &amp; Computers page, certain content  that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through  AECNU Internet &amp; Computers you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web  sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.  AECNU Internet &amp; Computers is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third  parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties  when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third  parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your  preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our  advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the  advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before.  Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third  parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.  AECNU Internet &amp; Computers does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the  resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of  such third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information  can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without  our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or  third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of AECNU Internet &amp; Computers  and this policy.</p>
<p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Children</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p></p>
<p>AECNU Internet &amp; Computers does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally  Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by  law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in  violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you  believe AECNU Internet &amp; Computers has any information from or about anyone under 13,  please contact us at the address listed below.</p>

<p>Changes to this Policy</p>
<p>AECNU Internet &amp; Computers reserves the right to change this policy at any time.  Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site  following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those  changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be  used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information  was collected.</p>
<p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Governing law</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p></p>
<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Pennsylvania  law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it  with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location:  Sofia Bulgaria. Any costs and fees other than attorney  fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through  mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the  following location: Sofia Bulgaria, under the rules  of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the  arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p>This statement and the policies outlined herein  are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in  or on behalf of any party.</p></td></tr>
