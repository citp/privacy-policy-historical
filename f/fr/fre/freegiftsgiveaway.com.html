            strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet

            <p>How we gather information from users</p>
            </b>
            <p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are 
            visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the 
            services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide 
            information when you register for access to certain portions of our 
            site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you 
            make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
            sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
            interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, 
            FreeGiftsGiveaway.com also collects information automatically and 
            through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our 
            visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service 
            Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold 
            information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may 
            store your user name and password, sparing you from having to 
            re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the 
            number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while 
            visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also 
            gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can 
            choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting 
            your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be 
            unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to 
            re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to 
            customize the site’s features according to your preferences.</p>
            <b>
            <p>What we do with the information we collect</p>
            </b>
            <p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your 
            visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We 
            respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
            <p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
            identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine 
            information about your usage patterns with similar information 
            obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services 
            (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are 
            most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared 
            with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information 
            does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you 
            or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>
            <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
            FreeGiftsGiveaway.com to communicate with you about your 
            registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and 
            privacy policy; services and products offered by 
            FreeGiftsGiveaway.com and other topics we think you might find of 
            interest. </p>
            <p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by 
            FreeGiftsGiveaway.com may also be used for other purposes, including 
            but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing 
            of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and 
            contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties 
            who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web 
            hosting service for example) may access such information. We will 
            use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from 
            time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, 
            buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such 
            transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. 
            We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, 
            at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so 
            by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to 
            us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it 
            appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with 
            notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>

            <p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other 
            third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to 
            identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. 
            For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and 
            may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether 
            you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features 
            available on our site may offer services operated by third parties 
            and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.

            third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible 
            for any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
            <p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose 
            Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat 
            areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected 
            and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in 
            unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such 
            activities are beyond the control of FreeGiftsGiveaway.com and this

            </b>
            <p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Pennsylvania 
            law. If a dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to

            attorney fees associated with the mediation will be shared equally 
            by each of us.</p>
            <p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory 
            solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to 
            binding arbitration at the following location: Sofia Bulgaria, under 
            the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the 
            award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with 
            jurisdiction to do so.</p>
