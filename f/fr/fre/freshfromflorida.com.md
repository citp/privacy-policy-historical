This is done so that the content of the site can be improved. Again, only aggregate information is collected, and your personal information is not identified.

If you choose to share personal information, such as by subscribing to an e-newsletter, sending a message, or filling out an electronic form with personal information, the information will be used by the department for only the reasons you authorize. Some of this information may be saved for a designated period of time in order to comply with the state of Florida's archiving policies.
