# Privacy Policy | Freizeit Job

Freizeit Job (" **Freizeit Job** ") operates http://freizeitjob.info and may operate other websites. It is Freizeit Job’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Freizeit Job collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Freizeit Job’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Freizeit Job’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Freizeit Job may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Freizeit Job also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://freizeitjob.info blogs/sites. Freizeit Job only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Freizeit Job’s websites choose to interact with Freizeit Job in ways that require Freizeit Job to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Freizeit Job gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.

Those who engage in transactions with Freizeit Job are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Freizeit Job collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Freizeit Job. Freizeit Job does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
