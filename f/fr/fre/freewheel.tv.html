We encourage you to check this Statement from time to time.&nbsp;

<h3>Privacy policy for the FreeWheel Web Sites</h3>

<p>You can visit and navigate through our main, corporate Web Site 
(<a href="http://www.freewheel.tv">www.freewheel.tv</a>) to gather information 
about our company and Services without telling us who you are and without revealing 
any personal information.&nbsp; In fact, we do not collect any information about 
your visit to this Web Site unless you provide us with information voluntarily 
(as described below).</p>
 
<p>You may wish to request information about our Services or our company.&nbsp; 
In order to facilitate the distribution of this content, you will be asked to provide 
information that could identify you personally, such as your name, company, title, 
phone number, e-mail address, site name, URL and address.&nbsp; Based on the nature 
of your request, FreeWheel may also ask for additional information, such as number 
of page views your site receives, how you anticipate you will make use of our products 
and services, and how you heard about us.&nbsp; Again, all of this information is 
provided by you on a voluntary basis only and is not required in order for you to 
use and enjoy our corporate Web Site.</p>
 
<p>If you are a customer, you will be required to enter certain information that 
can identify you personally (such as username and password) in order to access 
our user interface (<a href="http://mrm.freewheel.tv">mrm.freewheel.tv</a>).</p>   
 
<p>FreeWheel may use the information that you provide to us to contact you to 
further discuss your interest in our company and our Services, and to send information 
regarding our company or partners (such as marketing promotions and events).&nbsp; 
This information may also be used to improve the Services we provide you.&nbsp; 
The information is collected and stored in a manner that is appropriate for the 
nature of the data that we collect and the need to fulfill your request.&nbsp; 
This information is not shared with third parties for their own use, unless you 
specifically authorize such sharing.</p>
 
<p>When we are contacted via email, we answer by sending an email response to 
the sender.&nbsp; We also store the email we receive for archival purposes and 
for our own marketing purposes if we feel that it is consistent with the nature 
of the inquiry.&nbsp; We will not use return email addresses for any other 
purpose unless you give us permission to do so.</p>
 
<p>We may in connection with our Web Sites use the services of third parties 
(i.e., technology consultants, CRM vendors, etc.), who may, in the course of 
providing services to us, be given access to the information you have provided 
to us.&nbsp; Each of these service providers is contractually obligated to 
provide services to us in a manner consistent with this Statement.</p> 

<p>Our Web Sites may contain links to other Web Sites, such as those of our 
customers and partners.&nbsp; FreeWheel is not responsible for the privacy 
practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>

<h3>FreeWheel’s Provision of Services to Customers</h3>

<p>FreeWheel is an application services provider, meaning that we host a software 
application that our customers access via the worldwide web.&nbsp; Each customer 
understands that in the course of providing Services to it, we collect or receive 
information from the Web browsers of individuals that are either visiting such 
customer’s Web site(s) or viewing such customer’s content.&nbsp; This information 
includes frequency of ads delivered, time, browser type and version, and visitor’s 
operating system.</p>
 
<p>None of this information that we collect and store on our customers’ behalf 
can identify an individual person.&nbsp; As between FreeWheel and its customer, 
all of such information belongs to the customer, not FreeWheel.&nbsp; FreeWheel 
does not allow individual information collected and stored for one customer to be 
accessed by any other FreeWheel customer.&nbsp; Further, FreeWheel may use such 
information only as provided in its agreement with its customer.&nbsp; We do, 
however, reserve a limited right to disclose any data we collect if required 
by law or valid order of a court or other governmental authority.</p>
 
<p>We require each of our customers to abide by all applicable laws, rules 
and regulations that are applicable to their use of our Services, and we 
promise each customer that we will do the same with respect to our provision 
of Services.&nbsp; We ask each customer to post a privacy policy that covers 
our Services and to maintain all necessary rights to allow us to provide the 
Services, including without limitation to receive the information that we 
collect and store on such customer’s behalf.&nbsp; We also require each customer 
to permit no personally identifiable information to be sent to us.</p>

<h3>Cookies and End User Opt-Out</h3>

<p>Cookies are files that Web servers place on an Internet user’s computer 
that are designed to store basic information.&nbsp; FreeWheel uses a cookie 
in connection with its provision of Services.&nbsp; This cookie does not store 
any personally-identifiable information and is not otherwise used to provide 
your identity; it merely is used to recognize your browser.&nbsp; FreeWheel’s 
cookie is not specific to any of FreeWheel’s individual customers.&nbsp; 
Accordingly, if you choose to opt-out of FreeWheel’s cookie for any FreeWheel 
customer, you will be opted out for all of the Web sites and content providers 
that use FreeWheel’s Services.&nbsp; If you do not want a unique cookie from 
FreeWheel, there is a simple procedure to follow.</p>
 
<p>By electing to receive a special <a href="http://cue.v.fwmrm.net/ad/optout" target="_blank">
opt-out cookie</a>, ads delivered to your browser on behalf of customers using 
FreeWheel’s ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the 
non-personally-identifiable information that is automatically transmitted 
in the Internet environment when an ad&nbsp;request is received by FreeWheel’s 
ad&nbsp;servers.&nbsp; In such case, your FreeWheel cookie will not be uniquely 
identified.&nbsp; The non-personally identifiable information that is automatically 
transmitted includes your browser type, Internet service provider, information 
about the general content of the site or page displayed on your browser, and other 
non-personally-identifiable information provided by the Web Site or content 
provider.&nbsp; When you receive this cookie, FreeWheel’s systems will know 
that you have opted-out and will not attempt to assign other FreeWheel cookies 
in the future.&nbsp; Since the FreeWheel opt-out cookie does not contain a 
unique user number, it does not allow your browser to be identified uniquely.</p>
 
<p><em>PLEASE NOTE that if you erase or otherwise alter your browser's cookie file 
(including upgrading certain browsers) or use a new or different computer, 
you may need to opt-out again.</em></p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>We maintain security measures in place with the view to protecting against the 
loss, misuse and alteration of any information that is under our control.&nbsp; 
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, 
is 100% secure.&nbsp; While we are committed to use commercially acceptable means 
to protect your information, please be advised that FreeWheel assumes no responsibility 
or liability for disclosure of your information (personal or otherwise) due to 
errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond 
FreeWheel’s control.</p>

<h3>Changes in our business or privacy policies</h3>

<p>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell certain of our assets.&nbsp; 
In such transactions, visitor information may be one of the transferred assets.&nbsp; 
Also, in the event that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired in a 
transaction, our visitor information may be an asset that is reviewed and transferred.&nbsp; 
Such a transaction will be disclosed per the guidelines below.&nbsp; Also, we reserve 
the right to disclose any data we collect at our sites if required by law or valid order 
of a court or other governmental authority or to protect the health and safety of our 
employees or the general public.</p>
 
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policies, we will post those changes to this 
Privacy Statement, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always 
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, 
if any, we disclose it.&nbsp; If, however, we are going to use visitors' personally 
identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of 
collection we will notify visitors by posting a notice on our web site for thirty 
(30) days in advance of such use.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>This Web site is not intended to nor does it seek to receive information from 
children under the age of 13.</p>

<p>We provide all visitors to our web site with the opportunity to review, 
modify and delete any personally identifiable information that has previously 
been provided.&nbsp; You can send us an email or write to us as set forth below.</p>
