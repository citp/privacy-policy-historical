Your privacy is important to us and maintaining your trust and confidence is one of our highest priorities.

A recent changes in law require us (along with banks, brokerage houses, and other financial institutions) disclose our Privacy Policy to you – what we will do with pleasure.

## Information disclosure

As a rule we do not disclose personal information about our clients or former clients to anyone.

However, to the extent allowed by law and any applicable standards and regulations of professional conduct, certain nonpublic information about you may be disclosed in the following situations:

• To comply with a validly issued and enforceable subpoena or summons.

• In the course of a review of our company's practice under the authorization of state or national licensing board, or as necessary to properly respond to an inquiry or complaint from a licensing board of organization.

• In conjunction with a prospective purchase, sale, or merger provided that we take appropriate precautions (e. g. , through a written confidentiality agreement) so the prospective purchaser or merger partner does not disclose information obtained in the review course.

• As a part of any actual or threatened legal proceedings or alternative dispute resolution proceedings either initiated by or against us, provided that we disclose only the information necessary to the file, pursue or defend against the lawsuit and take reasonable precautions to ensure that the information disclosed does not become a matter of public record.

• To provide information to affiliates of the firm and nonaffiliated third parties who perform services or functions for us in conjunction with our services to you.
