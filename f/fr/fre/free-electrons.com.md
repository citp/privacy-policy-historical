# Bootlin's privacy policy

## Who we are

We are Bootlin, an engineering company sharing information about our services and technical experience on [this website](https://bootlin.com/).

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Comments

When you visit our website and leave comments we collect a nickname (you are not requested to give your real name). We have disabled the WordPress feature that requires an e-mail address, allows to give a public URL and stores your IP address.

In a nutshell, we just collect data that you chose to make public: the comment text and your nickname or name.

By posting a comment, you give us the right to remove it if we consider it is not suitable, or if we receive a request to remove it. As we are not collecting personal information about our visitors, we cannot be certain that the person requesting the removal is indeed the author of the comment.

### Cookies

Except for authenticated users who are only Bootlin affiliates, we don’t use cookies on this website.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

We don’t use any analytics to track where our visitors are coming from or what pages they go through when they visit our website.

## How long we retain your data

If you left a comment, the public comment and associated nickname or name may be retained indefinitely, unless we receive a request to delete or modify it.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have left comments on this website, you can contact [privacy@bootlin.com](mailto:privacy@bootlin.com) to request the deletion or modification of the comment or the associated nickname or name.

## How we process data

The text of visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

### How we protect your data

Our website is protected by standard security mechanisms offered by the GNU/Linux operating system, which we use to the best of our knowledge.

### What data breach procedures we have in place

As we do not store any non-public information about website visitors, we do not need to implement formal data breach procedures.

## Your contact information

Contact [privacy@bootlin.com](mailto:privacy@bootlin.com) for any question about this privacy policy.
