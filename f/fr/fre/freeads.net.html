<div id="subHeadContent">
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Different websites can each send their own cookies to your browser if your preferences allow it.

All browsers are different, so go to the help section of your browser to find out how to do this. A beacon is used in connection with cookies to gain an understanding of how a websites' users navigate through and process the content contained in the site.</p>
<p>To better understand your use of the freeads.co.uk site we work with third-party cookie providers such as Google Analytics, who place cookies and beacons on your computer to collect information on our behalf. When you sign in to freeads.co.uk, a cookie containing a value that uniquely identifies you to freeads.co.uk is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive.
