													Version 2.0</b></div>
													<br><br>

													respects the privacy of its customers and the users of this website.  This Privacy
													Policy ("Privacy Policy") discloses how we collect and use information, and the

													<br><br>
													<b>I. <u>Overview</u>.</b>

													screensavers, wallpapers, ringtones and other free content ("Download Offers").
													Additionally, Freeze is an online leader in delivering relevant promotions, content,
													offers and contests both through the Internet  through surveys and registration

													or through one of Freeze's partners or affiliates ("Online Offers").   Freeze's
													provision of and your use of Online Offers and/or Download Offers are referred to
													as the "Service".
													<br><br>
													Our Download Offers are often offered to you free in exchange for your agreement
													to also install third party software from our trusted business partners to further
													enhance your computer desktop or online experience ("Third Party Software").
													<br><br>
													Freeze is committed to making your use of <a href="http://www.freeze.com">www.freeze.com</a>,  <a href="http://www.screensaver.com">www.screensaver.com</a>,
													<a href="http://www.ringtone.com">www.ringtone.com</a>, <a href="http://www.wallpapers.com">www.wallpapers.com</a>, <a href="http://www.risoftsystems.com">www.risoftsystems.com</a>, and other Freeze owned
													sites (collectively the "Site") as easy and enjoyable as possible.  Please take a
													moment to read the following Privacy Policy to determine how your personal information
													will be treated as you make full use of our many offerings.  By using the Site and/or
													the Service, or providing the information requested by the Site and/or Service, or by

													Privacy Policy, you agree to accept the terms of our Privacy Policy and Freeze's use
													of the information it collects.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy
													Policy, please do not use the Site or participate in the Service.
													<br><br>
													<b>Freeze reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without giving
													you prior notice. Your use of the Site or the Service following any such modification
													constitutes your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy as modified.  The last
													date this Privacy Policy was revised or modified is February 2, 2006 ("Effective Date").</b>
													<br><br>
													<b>II. What information does Freeze collect from me?</b>
													<br><br>
													In order to effectively provide the Service and to continue to provide you with
													relevant Online Offers and popular Download Offers, Freeze collects personal
													information at various times during your use of the Service.  Wherever Freeze
													collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy
													Policy on that specified page.
													<br><br>
													<u>Registration</u>. During registration for Download Offers and/or Online Offers,
													Freeze will require your e-mail address in order to use the Service.  Download Offers
													and some Online Offers will also require your name, date of birth, zip code, country
													and gender, as well as a username, password and password reminder question. Freeze
													may require, your credit card for our premium content (credit card information is
													collected through a SSL secure connection).   Additionally, you may at times be
													requested to provide your personal interests in order to better provide the Service.
													The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are
													able to customize your experience and the Service that you receive.
													<br><br>
													<u>Installation of Download Offers</u>. When you agree to download our Download Offers,
													you will be asked to provide your email address, name, date of birth, zip code and
													country. Freeze may require, your credit card for our premium content (credit card
													information is collected through a SSL secure connection).  During the installation
													process you will be requested to complete surveys and/or offer forms for valuable
													offers from our business partners.  If you request additional information or offers
													from our business partners, your personal information will be provided to these
													business partners upon completion of the business partners offer form and your
													acknowledgment to submit such information to the business partner. Additionally,
													during the installation process you will have the opportunity to download other
													valuable software from our business partners to support our free content and to enhance
													your computer desktop or online experience. Freeze will share your personal information
													with those business partners that you elect to download software or content from.
													<br><br>
													<u>Surveys, Contests and Online Offers</u>. From time-to-time, our Site or the Service
													may request you to participate in occasional surveys or enter contests or other Online
													Offers (either by e-mail or directly through the Site). Your participation in these
													surveys or contests is voluntary and accordingly you have the choice to disclose any
													information that may be requested in a survey or contest. Information collected in
													these surveys and contests (including personal information) will be shared with the
													business partner that sponsors the survey or contest, as well as our other trusted
													business partners.
													<br><br>
													<u>Contacts/IP Information</u>. If you voluntarily submit information or contact
													Freeze (e.g. password request, technical support), we may keep a record of that
													correspondence. This information is not merged with other personally identifiable
													information that may have been collected by Freeze. Freeze also collects IP addresses
													for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers.
													<br><br>
													<u>Cookies</u>. For more information on cookies, please see part III below.
													<br><br>
													<b>III. What are cookies and how does Freeze use them?</b>
													<br><br>
													As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Freeze uses
													cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small amount
													of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard
													drive. Typically, Internet sites which ask you to log-in or that are customizable require
													that you accept cookies. Freeze utilizes both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
													For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie will terminate.  A
													persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period
													of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file
													directions. For more information on your choices regarding Freeze's use of cookies,
													please <a href="#vi">click here</a>.
													<br><br>
													Generally, Freeze uses cookies to:
													<br><br>
													<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
													(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our
													computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie
													is set when you register or "Login" and is modified when you "Customize" or "Logout" of
													our services. Freeze also uses cookies to store your zip code and other information you
													have submitted for other services, such as displaying your local weather.
													<br><br>
													(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing Freeze is given a unique cookie
													which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user
													versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests
													and behavior.
													<br><br>
													(3) Assist affiliates and merchants associated with Freeze to track visits to and
													business at their sites and stores. This information collected by cookies is sometimes
													called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen in
													each merchant's store.
													<br><br>
													(4) Measure certain traffic patterns, for example areas of Freeze's network of sites you
													have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to
													understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can
													make each new experience on a Freeze Site a better one. We may use this information to
													better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will
													see on our sites.
													</div>
													<br><br>
													Some of our business partners and the advertisers that serve ads onto Freeze may also use
													their own cookies on the Site.  We have no access over these cookies once we have given
													permission for them to set cookies for advertising.  The information collected and the
													uses to which that information can be used in the respective partner's and/or advertiser's
													privacy policies.  This Privacy Policy only covers the use of cookies by Freeze and does
													not cover the use of cookies by our advertisers and business partners.
													<br><br>
													<b>IV.  How does Freeze use my information?</b>
													<br><br>
													<u>Customized Service</u>. Freeze's primary goal in collecting personal information is to
													provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our Sites.  In order to provide
													Services free of charge, we display advertisements and encourage your participation in
													Online Offers and Download Offers. By knowing a little about you, Freeze is able to
													deliver more relevant advertisements, content and Online Offers, and hence better service,
													to you.
													<br><br>
													<u>Third Party Advertising</u>. In our role of delivering targeted Online Offers, Freeze
													plays the middleman. Third-party advertisers give us an advertisement or offer and tell
													us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Freeze
													takes the advertisement or offer and displays it to users meeting that criteria based on
													your personal information.  In other cases, personal information may be shared with
													Freeze's affiliates and trusted business partners so that they may directly deliver
													advertisements and offers.  This kind of targeted advertising is done with banner ads,
													Online Offers from Freeze, as well as offers from Freeze's affiliates and trusted
													business partners.  You will only receive special offers via email from Freeze, its
													affiliates and trusted business partners if you have indicated in your account
													preferences, or at some other time, that you would like to receive them.  For more
													information on Freeze's e-mail policies, please <a href="http://www.freeze.com/Policies/EmailBestPractices.aspx">click here</a>.
													<br><br>
													<u>Research</u>. Freeze does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior
													based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, from our
													server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve our users.
													This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.  Freeze shares this
													aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.
													<br><br>
													<u>Third Party Newsletters</u>. By participating in the Service, you agree to receive
													third party newsletters from Freeze Finders. There is no cost to receive this newsletter.
													Should you have any questions or concerns or if you would like to discontinue receipt
													of the Freeze Finders newsletter, simply e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@teamfreeze.com">support@teamfreeze.com</a> and ask
													to be removed from the Freeze Finders newsletter.
													<br><br>
													<b>V. With Whom Does Freeze Share My Information?</b>
													<br><br>
													When you are on a Site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that
													information with Freeze and our trusted business partners. For example, certain
													information like name, e-mail address and address, as well as your responses to survey
													questions, may be shared with affiliates and trusted business partners to better
													provide the Services and to provide you with timely Online Offers (from Freeze or our
													business partners) or products that interest you.
													<br><br>
													Promotions that run on Freeze may be sponsored by companies other than Freeze or may
													be co-sponsored by Freeze and another company. Some or all data collected during a
													promotion may be shared with the sponsor of that promotion.
													<br><br>
													Please be aware that Freeze partners, sponsors, advertisers, and web sites that have
													links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you once you
													leave the Site and access such third party content.
													<br><br>
													The information practices of Freeze's Internet access partners, advertisers, trusted
													business partners and web sites linked from Freeze are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
													Once you have submitted personal information to a third party or Freeze has transferred
													your personal information to a third party, your personal information is subject to such
													third party's privacy policy.  Freeze has no liability or responsibility for these
													independent privacy policies or the use of any personally identifiable information
													transferred to trusted business partners.
													<br><br>
													The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.
													<br><br>
													<u>Search Partners</u>. We may transmit your search queries (made on the Site or
													within one of our Software Offers) to search partners, who use this information to
													provide us with search results and other information, which we then will display
													to you.
													<br><br>
													<u>Third-Party Advertisements and Software</u>.
													<br><br>
													By accessing this Site and providing Freeze with personally identifying information
													about you such as your name, mailing address, phone number or any financial information
													such as a credit card number (assuming we have it), you agree that Freeze may share
													this information with affiliates and trusted business partners.  By downloading
													software from a Freeze business partner or sponsor or submitting information on an
													Online Offer to a third party business partner or sponsor, you specifically consent to
													the transfer of your personally identifiable information to such business partner or
													sponsor. Our free desktop enhancement software (wallpaper, screensavers, games, etc.)
													and the free version of ScreenMate® are supported by third-party software products.
													During the installation process of ScreenMate® or our free desktop enhancement software,
													you will be prompted to install additional third-party software products from trusted
													business partners. We may share information collected during the registration and
													installation process with these third party software distributors, provided that you
													elect to install their software. By downloading third party software, you are
													specifically consenting to the transfer of your information to such third party
													business partner. Once your personal information is transferred to a third party
													business partner, such information becomes subject to that business partners privacy
													policy. Our trusted business partners and sponsors will change from time to time, and
													therefore it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of our sponsors and business
													partners; however, some of the trusted business partners or sponsors that Freeze may
													disclose your personal information to include, without limitation:
													<ul>
														<li>Relevant Knowledge, an Internet customer of Knowledge Company and a service of
														Comscore Networks, Inc. For more information regarding Relevant Knowledge, please visit
														its web site at <a href="http://www.relevantknowledge.com">http://www.relevantknowledge.com</a>. The Relevant Knowledge Privacy Policy
														and User License Agreement is available at  <a href="http://www.relevantknowledge.com/RKPrivacy.aspx">http://www.relevantknowledge.com/RKPrivacy.aspx</a>.
														</li><li>Your personal information will be shared with subsidiaries of Freeze, including
														without limitation, Freeze Media, LLC and Gamepoint, Inc. for purposes of sending you
														the Email Offers.
													</li></ul>
													Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By
													requesting more information, you give Freeze permission to transfer your personal
													information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only
													your email address will be shared, in other cases, additional personally identifiable
													information or demographic information may be shared.
													<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
														<li><u>Freeze Shopping</u>: If you make a purchase from a store hosted by Freeze, or a
														merchant associated with Freeze, the information obtained during your visit to those
														stores, and the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information,
														is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions to take place. Merchants
														associated with Freeze have separate privacy and data collection practices. Freeze has
														no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information
														regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy policies, return to that store's
														home page and click on their information or privacy policy links, if any.
														</li><li><u>Third Party Data</u>:  From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to
														receive materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive
														information from these third parties, you agree that Freeze may share your name, email
														address and other information you provide with these third parties.
														</li><li><u>Other Limited Circumstances</u>. From time to time, Freeze may validate the
														information in its database by employing a validation service. In those instances, Freeze
														will disclose your personally identifiable information to third party validation services
														pursuant to confidentiality agreements. Under confidentiality agreements, Freeze may match
														user information with third party data. Also, Freeze discloses aggregated user statistics
														(for example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to current
														and prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
														</li><li><u>Legal Disclosure</u>: Freeze may also disclose account information in special cases
														when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify,
														contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Freeze's policies or
														may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally)
														Freeze's rights or property, other Freeze users, or anyone else that could be harmed by
														such activities. Freeze may disclose or access account information when we believe in
														good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we
														deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
														</li><li><u>E-Mail Suppression Lists</u>. Lastly, Freeze may disclose a users e-mail address
														as part of a suppression file or do-not-e-mail list to its partners and affiliates to
														make sure that a users unsubscribe requests are forwarded to the appropriate parties to
														insure removal of the user from partner and affiliate databases in compliance with law,
														including without limitation, the Can-Spam Act of 2003. For more information about
														Freeze's E-Mail Policies, please <a href="http://www.freeze.com/Policies/EmailBestPractices.aspx">click here</a>.
														</li><li><u>Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer</u>. Freeze may buy other businesses or their assets
														or sell our business assets.  Customer information is generally one of the business assets
														involved in such transactions.  Thus, in the event that Freeze or all of its assets are
														acquired, customer information, including any visitor information collected through the
														Site or the Service, would be one of the transferred assets.
													</li></ol>
