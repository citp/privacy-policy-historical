This helps us with marketing campaigns in order to market products and services to you directly, unless you have asked us not to. We may also disclose your information to third parties if the law requires it or to protect the rights or property of Freshly.

If you do not want us to share your contact information with other companies or organizations, or do not want to receive additional promotions from us, please let us know by emailing us at support@freshly.com. If you opt-out of promotional or newsletter emails from Freshly, we may continue to send you certain transactional communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages relating to Freshly that are necessary for our relationship with you.

The health and age information we collect allows Freshly to evaluate your self-reported health status to determine basic program eligibility. You will be notified at registration if your profile excludes you from participation in the plan. Freshly will not disclose your health and age information (including self-reported height and weight) to third parties.

**CREDIT CARD AND PAYMENT INFORMATION**

Freshly does not share payment information with third parties.

**INFORMATION PROVIDED IN OPTIONAL SURVEYS**

Freshly periodically asks members to participate in online surveys o to fill out online questionnaires concerning topics such as the effectiveness of the weight loss program, advertising effectiveness and customer satisfaction. All surveys and questionnaires are optional and the information collected will not be associated with any user’s personal information. Information gathered may be shared with third parties in order to improve customer satisfaction and program effectiveness. No personal information of any user will be connected to survey or questionnaire results.

**OTHER INFORMATION YOU MAY VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE**

From time to time, Freshly collects third-party email addresses or other contact information from our users and customers so that Freshly may send information to their friends and family on an as-requested basis. For example, Freshly collects email addresses when a customer provides us with that information so that we may send out Referral Coupons. We also require the same information when customers utilize certain functions such as “email this to a friend” features.

We have taken certain physical, electronic, contractual and managerial steps designed to safeguard the information we collect from you. Unfortunately, no data transaction over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The Site operator is not subject to the privacy and data security requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”).

Please consult your mobile service provider’s pricing plan prior to purchasing or downloading any application or registration for any such service to determine the charges for sending and receiving text messages from/to your mobile device. You will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving text messages or emails to your mobile device at the time you register for the campaign and with each message or email you receive.

Mobile marketing campaigns may involve your sending an e-mail from your mobile device to us or a third-party campaign operator. An e-mail or other response will then be sent to your mobile device. Opting to participate in a campaign is 100% your choice. When you engage in these mobile marketing campaigns, we and the third-party campaign operator may collect your cell phone number, the name of your wireless service provider, images that you send using your cell phone as part of the campaign, and other relevant information.

OUR BULLETIN BOARDS, SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES, CHAT ROOMS & USER BLOGS

Our program provides support through bulletin boards, chat rooms (support groups), social media pages and blogs. This format gives our members the opportunity to interact with each other. These areas are moderated to help keep inappropriate messages from being posted. You are offered the opportunity to include your e-mail address with your message, but you are not obligated to do so. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (whether it is on message boards, through e-mail, in meeting rooms, on social media pages or in blogs) your information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
