              <p align="center"><b><i><i>Privacy Matters 1-2-3</i>™ </i>and <i>Your Savings Club<span class="SuperScriptlarger">SM</span></i> Privacy and Security Policy</b></p>
              <p><i>Privacy Matters 1-2-3 </i> and <i>Your Savings Club</i> understand how important privacy is to our members. We have created  this online Privacy and Security Policy to demonstrate our commitment to  protecting your privacy and providing you with a secure and enjoyable member  experience.</p>
              <p>Our mission is to adhere to  policies that prevent unauthorized use of your personal information; to  maintain the accuracy of the information provided; and to protect the privacy  of your information through the use of secure servers and encryption devices.  The intent of this statement is to answer your questions about our online  Privacy and Security Policy.</p>
              <p><b>What information is collected? </b></p>
              <p>Generally, we gather two  types of information. The first type of information is the personally  identifiable information ("Personal Information") that you expressly  provide when you enroll in <i>Privacy Matters 1-2-3 or</i> <i>Your Savings Club</i>. This  information includes your name, mailing address or e-mail address or some other  unique personal identifier (e.g. city of birth or mother's maiden name) that we  can use to confirm sales and billing information (e.g. credit card number).  Occasionally, we may request other information from you that may be used by our  Membership Services department to confirm enrollment, update your account or  confirm your order. From time to time, we may offer you optional surveys that  may ask you for your opinions or demographic data (e.g. age and gender) so that  we can improve our program and offerings.</p>
              <p>The second type of  information is technical and statistical information that is collected  automatically whenever you visit our Web site. This type of information may  include things such as your IP address, operating system, type of browser and  Web site activity. We collect this data to help us improve the quality of our  Web site and make your visits to the site easy, convenient and meaningful. </p>
              <p>We do not link aggregate  user data with personally identifiable information.</p>
              <p><b>Who is collecting the information?</b></p>
              <p><i>Privacy Matters 1-2-3 </i> and <i>Your Savings Club </i>are marketed and distributed by Adaptive Marketing LLC, a leading  marketing solutions company. The information collected on the site is owned by  Adaptive Marketing LLC and/or its marketing partners depending on who offered you  membership in the program. </p>
              <p><b>How do we use the information collected?</b></p>
              <p>We use the Personal  Information you provide to service your membership. For example, we request  your mailing address so we know where to send the merchandise certificates,  gift cards and other benefits that you may purchase, and any other information  you may request. We also may send you additional membership information such as  updates about our program and special offers. We use your credit card  information to bill you for the membership fee and any benefits you may  purchase. We use your e-mail address to notify you of program updates, special  offers and promotions. If you prefer not to receive e-mail notifications from  us, simply visit our <a href="contact_xia_sta.html">Contact  Us</a> page, select "Unsubscribe to future marketing" from the drop-down menu, and  e-mail us your request. Be sure to include your name and membership ID number  as well as the e-mail address to remove from our list.</p>
              <p>The Personal Information that  is collected may also be shared with other groups within the Adaptive Marketing  organization, and with Adaptive Marketing's affiliates and /or marketing  partners, to bring you additional information and special savings offers.</p>
              <p>The technical and statistical  information that is automatically collected from your computer whenever you  visit<i> Privacy Matters 1-2-3 or</i> <i>Your Savings Club </i>is used to help us improve  the site and the member experience. From time to time we may disclose general  statistical information about our Web site and its visitors such as the number  of visitors, the number and type of products purchased, etc.</p>
              <p><b>Do you share personal information with third parties? </b></p>
              <p><i>Privacy Matters 1-2-3 </i> and <i>Your Savings Club </i>may share Personal Information with third parties whom we employ to  perform functions on our behalf and with whom we have contractual  relationships. For example, <i>Privacy Matters 1-2-3 or</i> <i>Your Savings Club </i>use a  third party to verify and process your credit card information in order to  charge you for requested benefits or services. All such third parties are  contractually obligated to use your Personal Information only for the purpose  for which it is given.<i> Privacy Matters 1-2-3 </i> and <i>Your Savings Club </i>are not responsible for the information  practices of third parties outside of such contractual relationships. The  collection, use and disclosure of information by third parties are subject to  their respective privacy policies, which may differ from our policy.</p>
              <p>From time to time, we may  also share Personal Information with our affiliates and/or marketing partners  who offer products and services that we think will be of interest to you. If  you prefer not to have your Personal Information shared with our affiliates  and/or marketing partners, please indicate what offers you are not interested  in receiving on the E-mail Preferences page, if available, or by sending us an  e-mail using the <a href="contact_xia_sta.html">Contact Us</a> page. If you  are enrolling online, you may also opt-out of receiving e-mails from third  parties outside of <i>Privacy Matters 1-2-3 or</i> <i>Your Savings Club</i> by de-selecting  the check box on the enrollment page.&nbsp;  If you accept a third-party offer provided via or linked to from our Web  site, you consent to our providing your Personal Information and/or billing  information to the third-party marketer that offered the product or service so  they may process your acceptance of the offer.</p>
              <p>We may also disclose your  Personal Information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such  action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with  legal process.</p>
              <p>As we continue  to develop our business, we may buy or sell assets. In such transactions, customer  information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the  unlikely event that our company or substantially all of its assets are  acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.  In the event that customer information is transferred as described in this  paragraph, members will be notified via e-mail and given the opportunity to  opt-out of having their Personal Information transferred to any new entity.</p>
              <p><b>How do I change/modify my information?</b></p>
              <p>You can change, modify or  update your member information by sending us an e-mail from the <a href="contact_xia_sta.html">Contact Us</a> page. You can choose  at any time to inform us of your e-mail preferences by sending us an e-mail  from the Contact Us page or, if available, by going to the E-mail Preferences  page where you can indicate what offers you are not interested in receiving.</p>
              <p><b>What are Cookies and how do you use them? </b></p>
              <p>A cookie is a small text  file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use  cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any  personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.&nbsp;Some of  our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.&nbsp; We have  no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy and Security Policy  covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of  cookies by any advertisers. </p>
              <p>We use persistent cookies.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  We use persistent cookies on the login page to store your Membership ID and for  re-direction of members to membership enabled Web sites. You can remove  persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. </p>
              <p>Most Internet browsers will  allow you to erase or block cookies. Instructions for disabling cookies may  differ from one browser version to another. Please refer to the Help section of  your browser for instructions to assist you in these processes: preventing your  browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you  receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies  allow you to take full advantage of some of our sites features, so we recommend  that you leave them turned on.</p>
              <p> If you reject cookies, you  may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, will be  limited. We do not use cookies for the shopping cart.</p>
              <p><b>What are pixels and how do you use them?</b></p>
              <p>"Pixels" or "pixel tags" are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages of our Web  site but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate  a generic notice of that visit; at no time is your Personal Information  collected by the pixel tag. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor  traffic and behavior on our Web site.&nbsp;  We may also utilize pixel tags provided by our affiliates and/or  marketing partners for the same purposes. </p>
              <p><b>How can I disable my pixel tags?</b></p>
              <p>You can disable pixel tags  by changing your browser settings to omit images.&nbsp; Alternatively, there are some commercial software packages  available that can omit pixel tags.</p>
              <p><b>How do you secure member information?</b></p>
              <p>We work to protect the  security of your information during transmission by using Secure Socket Layer  (SSL). When you place an order online, the SSL scrambles or encrypts your  information before it is sent to us over the Internet. This protects your  credit card information from being read while it is transferred through  cyberspace. When we receive your order, the information is kept encrypted until  we are ready to process your request. SSL is supported by Netscape 2.0+,  Microsoft IE 3.0+ and most frame-enabled browsers. You will see a small key or  padlock in the bottom right corner of your browser if you are using Netscape or  Microsoft browsers, indicating that your transaction is secure. In addition, we  meet all of the stringent requirements of the Verisign™ security  seal for all online transactions.</p>
              <p>Internal access to member  information is protected and can only be accessed by password. We also contract  with industry experts to institute and review Web security on a periodic basis.</p>
              <p><b>Do these same policies apply to third-party web sites that I access through <i>Privacy Matters 1-2-3</i> and <i>Your Savings Club</i>?</b></p>
              <p>No. The Privacy and  Security Policy appearing on this Web site relates to <i>Privacy Matters 1-2-3</i> and <i>Your Savings Club</i><i>.</i> You will notice that our  Web site may contain links to other sites such as our benefit providers. We  cannot be responsible for the privacy and security practices of other Web sites  that you may access through our site, even if displayed within a frame on our  site. As an online consumer, you should always review a particular Web site's  privacy and security policies when linking to that site before revealing any  Personal Information to that site.</p>
              <p><b>How do you update your Privacy and Security Policy?</b></p>
              <p>We will notify you if there  is a material change in our privacy practices. We will take commercially  reasonable measures to obtain written or active e-mail consent from the member  if<i> Privacy Matters 1-2-3 or</i> <i>Your Savings Club </i>is going to be using the  information collected from the member in a manner different from that stated at  the time of collection. We will also post the changes in our Privacy and  Security Policy prior to a change.</p>
