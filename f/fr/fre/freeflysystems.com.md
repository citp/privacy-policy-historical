**Cookies**

A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer hard drive.  Freefly uses cookies to store website visitors’ preferences and to record visit information, such as pages visited, time spent on the website, interactions with website features, shopping cart items, and purchase behavior for various purposes  such as ensuring that visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements, to tailor website content and newsletter communications according to visitor preferences, to serve online advertisements based on past visits to the website, and to inform and optimize website performance and online advertising campaigns.  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal Information you submit to us.

Freefly allows third parties to collect non-personal information by way of cookies, web beacons, and as described below from the Freefly website.  Freefly does not enable third parties to collect any personal information directly from the Services for their own promotional purposes.  You may be able to configure your browser to accept or reject all or some cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set through your browser settings.  However, by deleting or disabling cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of the website.

**Web Beacons**

Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web users.  While cookies are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded on web pages and are typically the size of a pixel.  One or more of our marketing partners uses web beacons to help us better manage content on our site by informing us as to what content is effective.

**Ad Servers, Third Party Advertising, and Website Analytics**

Freefly works with website analytics and advertising partners, including Google, Quantcast and Facebook, to deliver Freefly advertisements on third party publisher websites, and these partners may set cookies on your computer’s web browser. These cookies allow our partners to recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you Freefly advertisements elsewhere on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement and interactions while using freeflysystems.com.  As a result, ad servers may compile anonymous, non-personal information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw our advertisements, whether or not you interacted with our advertisements and actions performed on subsequent visits to freeflysystems.com. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you, and it allows Freefly to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the usability of our website.

**Information from Other Sources**

Freefly may receive information about you from third parties, such as commerce partners, marketers, social network services, and other parties that we may use to supplement the information that we collect directly from you.  If you connect to a third party network, platform, or service through the Services, you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the social network or other third party platform could provide to Freefly based on your settings on the third party social network or platform.  Your agreement takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform, or service via our Services, and/or when you connect with one of our applications through one of these services.
