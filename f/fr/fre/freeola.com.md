# Freeola Privacy Policy

## Introduction

We have chosen to minimise the information that we hold about you, and to make that information available to you within your MyFreeola account, and to store it securely and to delete it readily, and to gain your consent for non-essential marketing emails. However, basic transaction information must be retained under tax legislation, and it is also essential that we retain sufficient information to contact you if necessary, and to properly identify you before discussing your account with you.

Freeola Limited sells a mix of services and products, which are often fully provided by us, but sometimes involve others. We therefore work to ensure that our suppliers are privacy compliant and we monitor their privacy policies and keep records of such monitoring.

Unlike many other companies, we are not involved with buying, selling, mining, harvesting, gathering or collating any information about you.

It is our policy to be Ultra Private and to keep you informed along the way, gaining your explicit consent where necessary, and protecting your personal information. Our full Privacy Policy is presented below.

Product-specific privacy information and your email alerts and notification preferences can be found at the point of purchase or in your MyFreeola account.

## Our Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how Freeola Limited will use any personal information we collect about you when you use our sites or services. "Get Dotted" is a division of Freeola Limited. 

### 1\. What information do we collect?

We have chosen to minimise the information that we hold on you. However, when you use Freeola's services, we will ask you for some personal information, including:

  * #### Contact information:

When you purchase services, register a domain, create a forum profile, enter a competition or set-up any of our free services, we will ask you to create a MyFreeola Account; where we will request information such as your name, address, email address and telephone number. You can access and modify all of this information from your MyFreeola Account. Contact information may also be collected to provide customer support (via email, phone, post or live chat).

  * #### Payment/Transactional Information:

When you purchase any services or products from Freeola or Get Dotted; during the payment process we will securely pass you to a payment processing provider (such as SagePay or PayPal) before you submit credit or debit card information. We do not see or record this information, and therefore your payment information is more private and better protected.

If you choose to pay via Direct Debit, your details are securely passed to First Capital Cashflow (FCC), a Direct Debit collection and management company. We do not keep or retain this information (and will take sufficient steps to destroy any physical form submissions). Basic transaction information must be retained under tax legislation; such as your IP address and billing address. Some details will also be shared with a third-party fraud screening service, for further details please see Section 3.

  * #### Website Usage:

We use analytics tools to gather statistics from your browser (such as your IP address). We also use cookies to make our sites work for your sessions. Please see our [Cookies Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/cookies.php) for further information.

You can sign into your MyFreeola account, with alternative Quick Login through social media (Facebook or Google+) or with PayPal or Amazon. The only information that Freeola takes from these third-party accounts is your username (which is often your email address).

We do not request or obtain any further information from these services and nor do we share any of your personal information with them. We will not contact you via social media, retrieve information from your account or profile, or store or access your password. You can add or disconnect the Quick Login at any time via your MyFreeola account.

  * #### Domain Registration:

When you register a domain, it is a requirement of ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names & Numbers) that you provide registrant details to the domain registry. These details include registrant name, registrant type (company or individual), registrant address and email address. These details can be updated via your MyFreeola account. This information will not be publicly available, but may be made available to law enforcement and other selected agencies upon a suitable request or the production of a court order.

There are a number of ways that we may use your personal data; primarily it is to ensure that we are providing you with an effective service. Ways in which we may use your information include:

### 3\. Who do we share your information with?

Freeola sells a mix of services and products, which are often fully provided by us, but will sometimes involve others. We therefore work to ensure that our suppliers are privacy compliant and we monitor their privacy policies and keep records of such monitoring. Product-specific privacy information can be found at the point of purchase and in your MyFreeola account.

  * #### Line Rental:

  * #### Broadband and Dial-Up internet access:

We may share the relevant personal information with our supplier for Broadband internet services, including your name, address and telephone number. This information is necessary for them to supply the service to you on our behalf. To access our dial-up internet service, your telephone number and a record of the call duration will be logged by our supplier and by the phone network carrier.

  * #### Domain name registration:

As part of the Domain Registration Agreement, registrants must provide accurate registrant information including the name (or company name), email address and postal address. We will then pass these details on to the relevant domain registry or registrar (who will pass this on to the registry). Not providing accurate details is a breach of the Domain Registration Agreement and can lead to termination of the Agreement (and subsequent loss of the domain). All information can be updated via your MyFreeola Account or by contacting Freeola (see Section 10).

  * #### Payments:

When you make a payment you are securely passed to a secure payment processing provider (such as PayPal or SagePay), who will take your information and authorise the payment. Direct Debit information is securely passed to First Capital Cashflow and we will not retain these details. Direct Debit details will also be passed electronically to your bank or building society.

  * #### Fraud-prevention checks:

All payments go through a fraud check. Information such as your IP address, billing address and email address are passed on to MaxMind's minFraud service, which will check things such as the distance between the IP address and billing address as well as checking that the email address provided is not considered high-risk. The transaction will then receive a score, which will deem whether it is likely to be fraudulent.

  * #### Security products:

Upon purchasing ESET security software, you will be sent an email to download the software; your name and some other basic contact details may be requested. GeoTrust, Comodo or RapidSSL supply our SSL Certificates. When you purchase an SSL secure certificate, your contact information will be passed to the certificate issuer via our supplier. The SSL certificate issuer may need to verify this contact information and request confirmation and verification of your details. The level of verification is dependent on the certificate type that you choose.

  * #### Website analytics:

We use Google Analytics and Hotjar to collect website usage statistics. They gather information such as what operating system you are using and your IP address. Your IP address will be anonymised before it reaches Google. Hotjar also anonymise your IP address, and do not store any personally identifiable information.
