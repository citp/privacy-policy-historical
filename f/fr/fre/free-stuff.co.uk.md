Free-Stuff.co.uk is entirely owned and run by Quassim Yafai, which acts as the data controller and it is free-stuff.co.uk that has the responsibility of securing your personal information, which will be referred to as ‘us’, ‘we’ or ‘our’ throughout the rest of this privacy policy.

We are dedicated to making sure your personal privacy remains secure and protected. If we ask you to supply us with particular information that can identify you whilst using our site, you can rest assured that every process involving your data is performed according the rules set down in this privacy policy.

This privacy declaration is effect as of 1st of April 2018

**The Reason We Gather Your Information**

The information we take is so that we have the necessary information we need to send your periodic newsletter to you. Also, we use your details to make you aware of all the latest offers and available discounts in the fastest possible way, a service we offer at no cost to you.

**The Data We Collect**

The term ‘Personal Data’ refers to any information that can be used to identify you directly as an individual and does not refer to what’s known as ‘anonymised data’, which can’t be used to identify you.

We might use particular varieties of personal data that may include:

❏ Your gender, title and full name  
❏ Your postal and email addresses  
❏ Online technical information such as browser type, browser version, plugins, IP address, time zone, locale and Operating System used to access our website  
❏ What is known as ‘usage data’ could include data regarding the method you used to view our website and use our services and products  
❏ Marketing & Communications data which could include your own particular preferences in reference to what communications you receive from us and our 3rd party partners  
❏ We might also aggregate some aspects of your personal data, but none of it will be able to be used to identify you as a person. For example, we often try and evaluate the percentage of our site visitors that use a particular feature or service. Should we link your personal data to aggregated data, it is then also deemed as personal data.

We never gather any sensitive information about you as an individual. The term ‘Sensitive Data’ describes data that contains specifics of your gender, sexual orientation, philosophical or religious beliefs, ethnicity or race, memberships to trade bodies, political affiliations, biometric, genetics and health status. We also never gather data relating to any criminal offences or convictions. 

If you decide not to supply us with your data when requested to do so, under the terms of the agreement between yourself and our website, we then might not be able to supply the goods or services found there. If we are unable to supply you with the service ordered or otherwise, we will notify you in due course.

**The Reasons We Process Your Personal Data**

Listed below is a detailed account of the ways we may use your personal data and the legal aspects of the way we process it. Also listed is an explanation of what our ‘legitimate interests’ represent.

We might process your personal information in more than one lawful way, which is determined by the purpose of the action. If you require more detailed information about the exact legal reasons we process your personal data, please email us.

**Marketing Materials**

You may receive marketing materials from Free-Stuff.co.uk if:

❏ You have asked for information or signed up to the Newsletter  
❏ You ticked the consent box on our website to receive information about offers and deals

**Times We May Disclose Your Personal Data**

There are times when we may provide access to your personal data to our 3rd party service providers used by Free-Stuff.co.uk and these companies include:

❏ HM Revenue & Customs, authorities or regulators in the UK who demand details of specific activities in certain circumstances  
❏ Consultancy service providers we use for system administration, data and IT support

All of the 3rd party companies involved in the provision of services listed above and who receive your data are required to respect the sensitivity and security of this personal information and process it in line with the letter of the law. We only permit this type of company to process your personal information for very specific reasons and in a manner compliant with our instructions.

**International Transfers**

Nations located outside of the EEA (European Economic Area) don’t always provide the same protection to personal data afforded inside it, so the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA is expressly forbidden, unless a very specific set of qualifying criteria is met.

A number of our 3rd party service providers are located outside the EEA, so when we work with them, your personal data may be transferred outside of the aforementioned EEA. Whenever this happens, we do everything we can to ensure that a comparable level of security is used when dealing with your personal information.

**The Security of Your Data**

At Free-Stuff.co.uk, we have implemented suitable measures of security to stop your personal information from being altered, disclosed, used, lost or accessed without permission.  
Amongst these measures are appropriate electronic, managerial and physical procedures to protect the data we gather online.

Also, we restrict access to your personal information to those staff, contractors, agents and other 3rd parties who have a clear need to use this data in line with the services they offer. The processing of this information will only occur as per our specific instructions and is bound by a duty of confidentiality. 

We have implemented a set of procedures to address any suspected data breach and part of the process involves notifying you and any relevant regulator where the law requires us to.

**The Retention of Data**

Your personal information is only retained for as long as it is needed for the reasons it was originally collected for, as well as any reasons relating to accounting, reporting and legal requirements.

In order to determine the right amount of time to retain personal information, we take into account the sensitivity, the nature, the quantity and the potential risk involved in its unauthorised disclosure or use. We also constantly evaluate the methods we use to process your data, to ensure that they are being performed legally and in the most appropriate way.

The law requires that we retain contact, transactional and financial data relating to our customers for six years after they stop being our customers.

There are also circumstances in which you can request that your data be deleted. We may also ‘anonymise’ your personal information, so that it can used for statistical and research purposes. In this instance, the law allows us to use it indefinitely without any further notification to you.

**Your Rights Under Law**

In some situations, you, the consumer, have rights governed by laws relating to data protection and they include:

❏ To request to gain access to your personal information  
❏ To request that your personal information be deleted  
❏ To object to your personal information being processed  
❏ To withdraw your consent to any use of your personal data  
❏ To request the transferral of your personal information  
❏ To request that your personal data be corrected

Should you wish that any of the above rights be exercised, please contact us.

There are no costs involved in invoking any of the rights displayed above, but we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee if we believe that your request is excessive, unfounded or repetitive. In severe cases, we reserve the right to not comply with your request.

In order to confirm your identity, you may be asked specific information to determine your right to access the personal data in question or to exercise any of your consumer rights in the list above. This is a necessary level of security to make sure that sensitive data is not disclosed to anyone who has no right to access it. In order to resolve the query quicker, we may contact you to request further details relating to your enquiry.

We aim to respond to legitimate requests inside of a month, but it can sometimes take longer than this if the request is especially complex or there are numerous simultaneous requests being made. In this scenario, we will proceed as quickly as we can and keep you notified throughout the process.
