  * If you are a print subscriber to The New York Times newspaper and subscribed either by mail, phone or online, we may exchange or rent your name and mailing address (but not your e-mail address) with other reputable companies that offer marketing information or products through direct mail. If you prefer that we do not share this information, you may [opt-out](http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/privacy.html#g). 
  * NYTimes.com may share personal information with The New York Times Company for analysis purposes. NYTimes.com will not share personal information about you as an individual to third parties without your consent.  

  * The New York Times may perform statistical analyses of subscribers and their subscribing and purchasing patterns for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base.  

  * We may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent. 
  * We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing and analytics or promotions management.  

  * Any information you disclose when posting to a message board, along with your message board screen name or ID, becomes public and may be used by The New York Times for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.
