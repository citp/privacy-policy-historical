	b. "<strong>Cookies</strong>" are text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit or certain emails that you open.  A Cookie acts as a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website.  The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. ProBoards uses Cookies.<br><br>

	ProBoards uses cookies on the Website for the following purposes:<br><br>
	<ul>
		<li>to customize your experience on the Website to your interests</li>
		<li>to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements or informational messages repeatedly, and</li>
		<li>to store your session identifier so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Website.</li>
	</ul>

	IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSERS TO REFUSE COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES AND CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.<br><br>

	<a name="enhanced"></a>
	c. <strong>Ad Serving.</strong> ProBoards uses third-parties including <a href="http://datonics.com/consumer-privacy-center" target="_blank">Datonics</a> for advertising and analytics for pages that we host. These third-parties may place cookies on Your machine, use web beacons, gather IP addresses and log data to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver relevant metrics, content, and advertising.  Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data provider we have engaged may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content.   These cookies contain no personally identifiable information.  The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.  Some ad networks that are a part of the Network Advertising Initiative provide an easy way to opt out of behavioral targeting by utilizing the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">NAI Opt Out page</a>.  You can also visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">AboutAds.info</a> for more information and to opt-out.<br><br>

ProBoards may supplement the Personal Information You provide with additional Personal Information gathered from public sources or from third-parties (e.g., consumer reporting agencies) who may lawfully provide such information to ProBoards.<br><br>

	You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information, with the caveat that Your refusal to do so may prevent You from using certain of the Services.<br><br>
