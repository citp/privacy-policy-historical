<p>
</p><h4>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>
<p></p>

<p>
We may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. Cookies are identifiers that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites pages, or register with any of our site's services, a cookie enables www.free-online-calculator-use.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

<p>
We may serve third party advertisements that use cookies and web beacons in the course of ads being served on our web site to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement.

</p><h4>What is the DoubleClick cookie?</h4>
<p></p>

<p>
The DoubleClick cookie is used by Google in the ads served on publisher websites displaying AdSense for content ads.

</p>

<p>
* Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.<br>
* Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.<br>
* Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_new" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">Google ad and content network privacy policy.</a>
</p>

<p>
Because publisher sites and laws across countries vary, we're unable to suggest specific privacy policy language. However, you may wish to review resources such as the Network Advertising Initiative, or NAI, which suggests the following language for data collection of non-personally identifying information: 
</p>

<p>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_new" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">click here</a>.
