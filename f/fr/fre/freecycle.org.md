The Freecycle Network respects everyone's right to privacy. This section summarizes what personally identifiable information we may collect, if any, and how we might use this information. This policy also describes other important topics relating to your privacy. The Freecycle Network reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time.

## Use of Cookies

The Freecycle Network websites may use cookies to verify its visitors' identity to provide services related to the use of Groups. However, it should be noted that some Freecycle groups currently operate in the Yahoo!Groups environment, which means that cookies may be used in accordance with Yahoo's aims. It should be noted that cookies can also be used to further the aims of individual groups, for example, to ensure that each visitor may vote in any online poll only once. Cookies set by and for Yahoo!Groups are outside the control of The Freecycle network and are subject to Yahoo!Group's privacy policy.

Children may participate only with the permission and supervision of their parents and/or guardians. Freecycle.org does not intend to collect any information from individuals under the age of 13.

## Information Collection

In general, when you visit the Freecycle Web site and access information, you remain anonymous. We do not require you to register or provide personal information to us in order to view our site.

In these cases, we will only collect personally identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) that you voluntarily provide through our Web site or via e-mail correspondence.

We will not sell or exchange your personal information at any time. We will collect general information (such as the type of browser you use, the files you request, and the domain name and country from which you request information) to improve our Web site and better meet your needs.

## Use of Information

Before we collect any personally identifiable information, we will provide an explanation for the possible use of your data.
