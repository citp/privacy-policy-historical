**Our commitment to you**

The Frederick News-Post recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy. This policy is intended to outline our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information, and your reasonable expectations of privacy. It applies to all News-Post websites, mobile platforms, apps, social media activities, contests, merchandise sales and related online components and technologies, such as advertising, marketing or registration platforms and the like, which are collectively referred to below as “Online Services.”

We use both session cookies (these last until you close your browser) and persistent cookies (these last until you or your browser deletes them). We use cookies to recognize you and to provide personalization as well as help us understand how people use our Online Services.
