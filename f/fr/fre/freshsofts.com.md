# Privacy Policy : Freshsofts.com

**Your Information**

Privacy policy of Freshsofts.com covers the collection and use of personal information that may be collected by Freshsofts.com anytime you interact with us such as when you make a purchase, contact a technical support or sales associate, sign up for an e-newsletter or request a download of demonstration software.

We collect your personal information because it assists us in delivering a high level of customer service. For example, your personal information helps us to keep you informed and up-to-date on the latest product updates and announcements as well as special offers that may be extended from time to time.

When you provide Freshsofts.com with your name, email address, mailing address or telephone number, and you do not “opt-out”, Freshsofts.com and our customer representatives and authorized affiliates may use the provided information to alert you to product updates, special offers, updated information, new products and other information. Other than our representatives and authorized affiliates (such as value-added resellers), Freshsofts.com does not offer, sell, or otherwise make available any user-provided information to third parties.

Freshsofts.com will send notifications regarding product updates and technical support notices. These messages are deemed essential to the functionality of your product and as such, there is no “opt-out” available for update notifications.

If you do not want us to contact you, you may “opt-out” at any time. You may “opt-out” by contacting Customer Service Department of Freshsofts.com or by following the instructions included in the email correspondence.
