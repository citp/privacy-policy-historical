**Last updated on (October 31, 2008.)**

General  
USSTB will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (e.g. your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address ("personal data") through our web site unless you have provided it to us voluntarily. If you do not want your personal data collected, please do not submit it to us.

Personal Data  
USSTB will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (e.g. your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address ("personal data")) through our web site unless you have provided it to us voluntarily. If you do not want your personal data collected, please do not submit it to us.

When you do provide us with personal data, we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may store and process that information to better understand your preferences and how we can improve our products and services; we (or a fulfillment house or other third party working on our behalf in connection with a promotion) may use that information to contact you; and/or we may provide other third parties working on our behalf with aggregate — but not individual — information about visitors to our sites. Neither we nor any third party working on our behalf will sell, rent or market personal data about you to another third party unless you have given us specific permission.

If you disclose personal information to us via registration in connection with a promotion that we run, we may use that personal information to contact you (e. g., if you win a contest) and disclose that information to third parties for purposes of administering the promotion (e. g., travel agencies) and required government reporting (e. g., income tax reporting).

USSTC may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or legal process, to law enforcement or other government authorities or if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, such as fraud.

Additional Information Collected Automatically  
In some cases, we may automatically (i.e., not via registration) collect technical information when you connect to our site that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the kind of computer operating system you are using and the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our site. If your IP (Internet Protocol) address is collected, we may use it, in the aggregate with other IP addresses, to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use IP addresses on an aggregated basis to examine our traffic on our websites -- not to collect or evaluate individual information.

When you view one of our web sites, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie" or similar file and can help us in many ways. For example, Cookies allow us to tailor a web site to better match your interests and preferences. With most Internet Browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block all Cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.
