    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as processing your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
    <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>

    	<li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
        <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</li>

        <li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. User Access and Choice</h3>
    <p>If your personally information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete, or ask to have it removed from our blog or testimonial page by making the change directly from your user account settings page, by emailing our Customer Support at 
    <script language="JavaScript">
			user = 'support';
			site = 'freewebsite.com';
			document.write('<a href=\"mailto:' + user + '@' + site + '\">');
			document.write(user + '@' + site + '</a>');
		</script><a href="mailto:support@freewebsite.com">support@freewebsite.com</a> or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.  We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.</p>

    <h3>4. Tracking Technologies / Cookies</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies on this site.  We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
    <p>We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.  Session ID cookies are used for auto login to remember your user name and password.  A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  Persistent cookies are used for ads that are tailored to your individual preferences.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. For more information on cookies and their use, please email 
    <script language="JavaScript">
			user = 'support';
			site = 'freewebsite.com';
			document.write('<a href=\"mailto:' + user + '@' + site + '\">');
			document.write(user + '@' + site + '</a>');
		</script><a href="mailto:support@freewebsite.com">support@freewebsite.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.</p>
    <h2>Web Beacons / Gifs</h2>
    <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
    <h2>Analytics / Log Files</h2>
    <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
    <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
    <h2>3rd Party Tracking</h2>
    <p>The use of cookies by our technology partners, affiliates, or service providers is not covered by our privacy policy.  We generally do not have access or control over these cookies.  These 3rd party trackers may use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and facilitate usage of certain features.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Security</h3>
    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
    <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at 
    <script language="JavaScript">
			user = 'support';
			site = 'freewebsite.com';
			document.write('<a href=\"mailto:' + user + '@' + site + '\">');
			document.write(user + '@' + site + '</a>');
		</script><a href="mailto:support@freewebsite.com">support@freewebsite.com</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>6. Additional Information</h3>
    <h2>Links to 3rd Party Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Freewebsite.com.  If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.</p>
    <h2>Blog / Forum</h2>
    <p>Our Web site offers a publicly accessible blog. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at 
    <script language="JavaScript">
			user = 'support';
			site = 'freewebsite.com';
			document.write('<a href=\"mailto:' + user + '@' + site + '\">');
			document.write(user + '@' + site + '</a>');
		</script><a href="mailto:support@freewebsite.com">support@freewebsite.com</a>.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <p>We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to other endorsements.  With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name.  If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at 
    <script language="JavaScript">
			user = 'support';
			site = 'freewebsite.com';
			document.write('<a href=\"mailto:' + user + '@' + site + '\">');
			document.write(user + '@' + site + '</a>');
		</script><a href="mailto:support@freewebsite.com">support@freewebsite.com</a></p>
    <h2>Referrals</h2>
    <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  Freewebsite.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.  Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
    <h2>Social Media Widgets</h2>
    <p>Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter live feeds. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
    <h2>Changes To This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
