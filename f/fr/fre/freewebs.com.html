<h1>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h1>
<p>This site is owned and operated by Freewebs Corporation, the parent company of Freewebs.com. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Freewebs.com, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. 

</p><p>Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

</p><h2>Information gathered by Freewebs.com</h2>
<p>Freewebs.com gathers two types of information about users:

</p><ol>
 <li>1.	Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions when creating a Freewebs account such as your name or email address. 
 </li><li>2.	Information Freewebs.com gathers through aggregated tracking, derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to users' needs and to help us better understand the demographics of our audience. Under no circumstances does Freewebs.com divulge any information about an individual user to a third party unless mandated by law. 
</li></ol>

<p>Freewebs.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:
</p><dl>
 <dt>Optional Voluntary Information
 </dt><dd>We offer the following free services, which require some type 
 of voluntary submission of personal information by users:
 
 <ol>
  <li>Free Web Hosting<br>
During the account creation process, the user is required to supply their full name, username, password, and email address. <b> Except as specified in this Privacy statement,</b> we will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. <br> <br>

"You can access and update your personal information by logging in and visiting your My Account and My Profile areas and following the instructions on those pages, or by contacting customer support.  You can delete certain personal information you supplied us by visiting your My Profile area.  If you delete such information, it cannot be used by us or disclosed to third parties in the future.  Even if you delete or change some personal information in our registration database, it may still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes)." <br> <br>

Any files uploaded or created on the Freewebs system are by nature of being hosted, for the public and are thus publicly accessible unless they are stored in the user's optional password-protected directory. Files in a password protected directory will only be accessible by means of a username and password which the user will provide. <br><br>

  </li><li>"E-mail this to a friend" Service<br>
  Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, 
  or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to 
  a friend". The user must provide their email address, as 
  well as that of the recipient. This information is used in 
  the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient 
  know who sent the email.
  </li><li>Polling<br>
  We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share 
  their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks 
  about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are 
  aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Freewebs.com 
  may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, 
  so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag 
  is not correlated with information about individual users.
  </li><li>Surveys<br>
  Freewebs.com may occasionally conduct optional user surveys to 
  better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share 
  the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our 
  sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this 
  information about specific individuals with any third party.
 </li></ol>

 </dd><dt>Children
 </dt><dd>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 since we do not allow anyone under the age of 13 to signup.   
 </dd><dt>Usage tracking
 </dt><dd><p>Freewebs.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our 
 sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data 
 about individual users. Freewebs.com does break down overall usage 
 statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and 
 <abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr>
 type by reading this information from the browser string 
 (information contained in every user's browser).
 </p><p>Freewebs.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that 
 users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never 
 associated with individual users. We use tracking information 
 to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like 
 based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual 
 users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This 
 helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>
 </dd><dt>Cookies
 </dt><dd><p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser 
 files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal 
 Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this 
 site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. 
 But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information 
 you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk 
 or read cookie files created by other sites. Freewebs.com uses 
 cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our 
 advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track 
 ad impressions and click rates.
 </p><p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If 
 you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, 
 you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do 
 not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, 
 you do need cookies to participate actively in message boards, 
 forums, polling and surveys.

<h2>Use of Information</h2>
<p>Freewebs.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users 
to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to 
provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to 
better prepare future content based on the needs and interests 
of our users.

</p><p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of 
our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those 
areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather 
how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to 
build a better service for you. We track search terms entered 
in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our 
user's interests.

</p><p>Freewebs.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and 
traffic patterns. This allows us to more effectively tailor 
advertising and promotions to our users

</p><h2>Third Party Advertising and Cookies</h2>
Ads appearing on this Web site and Freewebs sites are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visits to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about DoubleClick, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy">click here.</a>

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

              
<h2>Sharing of the Information</h2>
<p>Freewebs.com uses the above-described information to tailor our content to 
suit your needs and help us better understand our audience's demographics. This 
is essential to keeping our service free. We will not share information about 
individual users with any third party, except to comply with applicable law 
or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the 
public.

</p><h3>Security</h3>
<p>All payment procedures of Freewebs.com operate on secure data 
networks protected by industry standard firewall and password 
protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically 
reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals 
have access to the information provided by our customers.</p>

Although we have established and maintain commercially reasonable security procedures to protect your personally identifiable information, perfect security, does not exist on the Internet.  Furthermore, due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties.  For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.  Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.

<h2>No Spyware / Adware</h2>
<p>We have a <a href="page.jsp?page=spywarePolicy">strict policy against spyware 
and adware</a> and apply this to all Freewebs users as well.

</p><h3>Opt-Out Policy</h3>
<p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p>

<p>Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which 
completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable 
information from our users.

</p><p>Opting to delete and close their Freewebs account at any time for any reason.

</p><h2>Your Consent</h2>
By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information 
by Freewebs.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those 
changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, 
how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
