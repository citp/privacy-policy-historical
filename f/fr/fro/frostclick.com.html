This includes personalization services, interactive communications, and many other types of services, all of which are completely free to you.  In order to provide services free of charge, we may display advertisements.   By knowing a little about you, Frostwire is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.</p>

<strong>Who is collecting information?</strong>

<p>When you are using Frostwire and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Frostwire alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise.   If data is being collected and/or maintained by any company other than Frostwire, you will be notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer.  If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.</p>

<p>Please be aware that Frostwire advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you.  The information practices of those Web sites linked to Frostwire are not covered by this privacy statement.</p>

<strong>Special Adsense Notification for FrostClick.com</strong>

<p>In this usage policy, the Adsense usage disclaimer has been added by the recommendation of Google, which serves ads on frostclick.com through its Adsense program.</p>

<p>When you visit www.frostclick.com and click an advertisement syndicated by Google, a cookie (<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx" rel="nofollow">DoubleClick DART Cookie</a>) is automatically added to your browser to help Google deliver you more targeted and useful ads.</p>

<p>If you do not wish to get the cookie on your browser, you can visit Google ad and content network privacy policy.</p>
<p>This is done in accordance with the <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/topic.py?topic=8423" rel="nofollow">Google Adsense policies</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms" rel="nofollow">Google Adsense terms and conditions</a>, and the latest notification of changes in Google's <a href="http://adsense.blogspot.com/2008/02/updated-terms-and-conditions.html" rel="nofollow">official Inside Adsense blog here</a>.</p>

<strong>With whom does Frostwire share my information?</strong>

<p>As a general rule, Frostwire will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under court order or subpoena.</p>

<p>Frostwire may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Frostwire's Terms and Conditions of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Frostwire's rights or property, other Frostwire users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  Frostwire may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.</p>

<strong>What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?</strong>

<p>You have choices with respect to cookies.  By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.  If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those Frostwire services that require registration in order to participate.</p>
<p>Frostwire does not sell or rent user information to anyone.  We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer.  If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests.</p>

<strong>What is Frostwire's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?</strong>

<p>You may edit your Frostwire Account Information at any time by using your Frostwire ID and password.</p>

<strong>What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</strong>

<p>Your Frostwire Forum Account Information is password protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information.  You may edit your Frostwire Forum Account Information by using your User ID and password.</p>

<p>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  Frostwire will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.  Also remember to sign out of your Frostwire account and close your browser window when you have finished your work.  This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Frostwire cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p>

<strong>What about children's privacy?</strong>

<p>Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us Frostwire is a general audience Web site.  Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone online.  Frostwire does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of age.  In addition, Frostwire will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13.</p>

<strong>What else should I know about my privacy?</strong>

<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas that information can be collected and used by others.  In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.  Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.</p>
