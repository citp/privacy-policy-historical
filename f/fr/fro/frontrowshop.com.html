<p>How does FrontRowShop.com use cookies and other technology to collect information?</p>
<p>Cookies are small pieces of information that your Internet browser stores as text files on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers accept cookies by default, but setting your browser to refuse cookies or removing them from your hard drive will prevent you from using parts of this Website. FrontRowShop.com uses cookies to:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* Speed up navigation&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* Track Website usage</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* Recognize users and user access privileges</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* Enable selection and purchase products on this Website to record your browsing activity and purchases</p>
<p>We may use content or ads from third-party advertising companies that may use cookies and web beacons to measure web page visits or amount of products purchased. Any information these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information we collect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internal Use: We use personal information to process your order and provide you with customer service. We may use your personal information internally to collect general information about visitors to this Website, improve Website content and layout, improve our outreach, and market our services and products.</p>
<p>Communication with You: We will use your personal information to communicate with you about our Website and your orders. All customers must provide an email address to allow communication with FrontRowShop.com regarding orders placed. We may send you a confirmation email after you register with us as well as service-related announcements when necessary (for example, temporary suspension of service for maintenance).

You can unsubscribe or opt out of future emails at any time.</p>
<p>Does FrontRowShop.com ever give out personal information?</p>
<p>We sell merchandise, not information — we do not sell, rent, trade, license, or otherwise disclose your personal or financial information to anyone, except in the following specific situations:</p>
<p>Third-party service providers: Like most online retailers, we sometimes use third-party service providers to perform specific functions on our behalf. Any information disclosed to them is solely to help with their provision of service. For example, we provide your name, shipping address, email and phone number to partners such as DHL and UPS in order to guarantee delivery of your orders, and we may use relevant customer information in order to monitor the quality of the third party’s service.</p>
<p>Similarly, we must provide your credit card number to financial services organizations such as credit card processors and issuers in order to process payments. We protect all submissions of your credit card number for authorization with state-of-the-art data encryption.</p>
<p>Legal requirement to disclose information: We may be required to disclose information if subpoenaed, served with a court order or requested by law-enforcement officials conducting investigations, or if we are otherwise required by law to disclose such information. We will also release personal information when necessary to protect our legal rights or enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements. For example, we may share information to reduce the risk of fraud, or to prevent fraud by users who attempt fraud or other illegal activity on our Website.</p>
<p>Merger and/or sale of assets: We do not normally sell, trade or rent personal information to other companies in the course of our business. However, it is possible that we might acquire, merge with or be acquired by another company, or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets, in which case your personal information could be disclosed to another company, subject to the Privacy Notice in effect.</p>
<p>Non-personally identifiable information: We may share information that does not identify you or any user, such as the number of daily visitors to a particular page, or the size of an order placed on a certain date, with third parties such as advertising partners.</p>
<p>How does FrontRowShop.com secure information collected?</p>
<p>The Website incorporates physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp; * Safeguarding all financial transactions done through this Website with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; * Granting only employees who are providing a specific service access to your personal information&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; * Working only with third-party service providers who we believe adequately secure all computer hardware.</p>
<p>While our business is designed with safeguarding your personal information in mind, please remember that 100% security does not presently exist anywhere, online or offline.</p>
<p>What choices do I have regarding FrontRowShop.com’s collection of personal information?</p>
<p>You can choose to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* Correct or update your personal information&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* Stop receiving email to your email address&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* Disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account</p>
<p>To correct or update your personal information, log in to My Accounts and then change your Account Information. To unsubscribe from emails you receive from FrontRowShop.com, log in to My Account and then untick Newletter Subscriptions.</p>

Elsewhere on this Website, you have represented and warranted that you are either 18 years of age or are using the Website with the supervision of a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information to us, and rely on a parent or guardian to assist you when using the Website.</p>
<p>How does FrontRowShop.com use and disclose information collected offline?</p>
<p>As FrontRowShop.com collects most information through the Website, this Privacy Policy applies only to online collection of personal information.</p>
<p>We also protect all personal information that is collected from you offline, such as through phone calls. If we contact you by telephone regarding an order or payment, we will ask only for the personal information needed to place your order or resolve your issue. When we need to store information related to an order, we enter it into our database through SSL encryption.</p>
<p>This Policy does not attempt to cover all possible offline methods of collecting or using personal information, however, we will treat any offline collection, use, or disclosure of personal information in a manner consistent with our online practices.</p>
<p>Where can I find updates to this policy?</p>
<p>To keep you informed of what information we collect, use, and disclose, we will post any changes or updates to this Privacy Notice on this Website or send you an email regarding updates to the Privacy Notice and encourage you to review this Privacy Notice from time to time. Please contact us with any questions about the Privacy Notice.</p>            </div>
