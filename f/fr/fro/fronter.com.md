While you’re on our site, we’ll collect and store information about you in accordance with this policy. If you don’t agree with this, please visit our [Cookie Policy](https://itslearning.com/global/cookie-policy) for information about how to turn tracking off, or, exit the site entirely – we won’t take it personally.

We are a global company, so when you provide us personal data, that data may be used, processed, or stored anywhere in the world, including in countries that have data protection laws that are different to the country in which you reside. However, itslearning has policies and procedures in place that are constructed to safeguard and ensure an equal level of protection is applied across the entire organization and in accordance with this Policy.

This Privacy Policy (which we’ll refer to as “Policy” going forward), describes practices with regards to our marketing websites (“website” going forward), e-mails, affiliates, virtual and in-person events, offline sales, and additional marketing and sales activities.

## WHO COLLECTS THE DATA

All data is collected on behalf of itslearning AS, Solheimsgaten 7D, 5058 Bergen, Norway and its subsidiaries. We can be contacted by email: [post@itslearning.com](mailto:post@itslearning.com) or via phone at +47 55 23 60 70.

## WHAT DATA WE COLLECT

We will never collect data about you without clearly stating what information we are requesting and what we will use it for. This is the data we collect:

  * Your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number
  * Company information including name, physical address, size
  * Geographical location, IP address, including country, state or province
  * Behavioral or demographical information
  * Data from marketing opt-in lists, campaigns, surveys, or publicly available information
  * Collaboration information



## HOW WE COLLECT DATA

Through your interaction with us or use of this website, we may collect the following personal information that identifies you as an individual:

  * Information you provide through form submissions on our websites. This includes when you contact us, subscribe to our marketing communications, download collateral, register or attend an itslearning event or partner event, and purchase products or services.
  * Information you provide when applying for a job.
  * Information that you submit to us or itslearning employees when you want to engage in business or potential business with us.
  * Information you provide us through our website, in-personal conversations or events.
  * Information from surveys, reviews, or inquiries that you voluntarily take part in.
  * Information you submit to us via social media channels.



We don’t intentionally solicit, collect or process data for anybody under the age of 18. If it happens by accident, we delete it immediately.

We collect data via third-party advertisers, such as Google Adwords remarketing service. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network.

## WHY WE COLLECT DATA

We collect your data to better provide you information and determine whether our LMS would be a good fit for you. In those cases where we use legitimate interest as lawful basis for our data processing, we will always balance our interest with your right to data privacy.

The legitimate interest basis makes processing lawful only if it is necessary of the controller. It requires transparency and the successful outcome of a balancing test between your right to privacy and our interests. Transparency means it shall be clear to you which data is used and how it’s used. A balancing test requires us to take into consideration factors such as:

  * That our interest as controller is significant compared to the impact on your data privacy
  * That we only process what can reasonably be expected by you
  * That we cannot achieve the same by not processing the data



As such, our purposes are always legitimate, and the disadvantages to you are few.

These are our specific purposes for processing your data:

  * Identifying and targeting educational institutions that have an interest and need for a learning management system
  * Promoting our learning management system to interested potential customers
  * Nurturing relationships with interested potential customers, whether we initially encountered them via telephone, web or in-person.
  * Managing customer relationships, to better communicate any updates or changes they might be interested in



## HOW WE USE THE DATA

We only collect or process your data we are performing a contract, when we have consent, or when we have a legitimate interest.

Your **consent** must be clear, unambiguous and freely given. When we request information, we have to tell you what we’d like to know and why. **Legitimate interests** are uses that are necessary to provide a product or service, or those that could be reasonably expected by the person whose information is being collected.

If no activity, interest, intent or need can be identified within a 2-year period, we delete your data. Please note that third-party sites may retain it. The only time we will retain your personal information for longer than is outlined in this Policy is when it is required by law.

The chart below explains how we use the data collected through each of our channels, the purpose and the legal basis we have for doing so.
