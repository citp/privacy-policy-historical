IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT WITH YOUR PARENTS OR GUARDIAN AND ASK THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

This website, fronter.com, com.fronter.info or frontersupport.com (the "Site"), is owned and operated by Fronter AS ("Fronter"). Fronter is a Pearson company and has aligned its privacy statement with that of Pearson. Fronter recognises the importance of explaining our privacy policies to users of our Site and protecting the privacy of Personally Identifiable Information we obtain through the site. Please note that this Privacy Statement may be revised from time to time, particularly to address changes in our business, the law or technology. If that happens, we will post the revised policy here. Revisions are effective upon posting and your continued use of this Site after the posting will be subject to the changed terms of the revisions.

LINKS TO OTHER SITES

Links from this site can take you to the sites of several divisions of Pearson as well as to third party websites or resources. The information practices of third party websites are not covered by this Privacy Statement or any other policies or terms of this Site. The sites of each of our divisions may also have a different privacy policy and terms of use. Be sure that you know the terms of use and privacy policy of any linked website before using it.

WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND USE

We consider the following to be examples of Personally Identifiable Information but there may be others: your first and last name, email address, phone number, and certain other information if it is linked with your Personally Identifiable Information.

Fronter does not collect Personally Identifiable Information about a user, unless it is voluntarily provided to our Company and so that we can serve the user's needs and our legitimate business purposes as stated here. For example, when the user sends us a message, submits a Tips&Tricks article or an Admin forum contribution, we need to retain certain Personally Identifiable Information on this Site in order to respond. A user's Personally Identifiable Information may also be used by our company to help us improve this Site, and for our company's marketing and promotional purposes. The information will be treated confidentially within our company, as we protect other confidential information. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of some of our features.

PUBLIC POSTINGS

Due to the nature of the Internet, users should be reminded that any Personally Identifiable Information that is posted by a user to a public area of the Site (for example in a Tips &Tricks posting or a comment) might be collected and used by others. We cannot prevent such uses.

INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE

Except as specifically stated in this statement, our policy is not to share the Personally Identifiable Information collected through this Site with third parties, but we may share this Personally Identifiable Information with affiliates of Pearson, and other companies and organizations who perform work for us under contract or sell products or services that complement our products and services. We also may disclose Personally Identifiable Information (a) in response to a subpoena, court order or legal process, to the extent permitted and required by law; (b) to protect user security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws; (c) in connection with a sale, joint venture or other transfer to some or all of Pearson or the assets of Pearson; or (d) in order to enforce the Site's Terms of Use, to the extent permitted by law. We exercise commercially reasonable care otherwise not to share, disclose or sell the Personally Identifiable Information of users to third-parties, except with the prior approval of the user.

Fronter may use a third party service to collect visitor information like IP addresses, browser types (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), referring pages, pages visited and time spent on a particular site. Fronter collects this information (1) for statistical analysis of web page traffic patterns; (2) to administer our Site and servers; and (3) for internal purposes to make marketing decisions.

SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS, TEACHERS AND CHILDREN

PARENTS AND TEACHERS: We encourage parents, guardians and teachers to spend time with their Children (Children 12 and under) when their Children engage in the on-line activities on this Site. We will never request Personally Identifiable Information from a Child in any of our public postings areas. We do not require a Child to disclose more Personally Identifiable Information, than is reasonably necessary to participate in the on-line activity. No Personally Identifiable Information of children should be submitted to or posted on this Site by Children without the consent of their parent or guardian. We encourage parents to help us protect their Children's privacy by instructing them never to provide Personally Identifiable Information on this Site or any other website without parental permission.

CHILDREN: Please do not give your full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other Personally Identifiable Information that would enable someone to contact you either on-line or off-line, without first asking your parent or guardian and teacher for permission.

We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from Children on this Site either directly or passively except when a Child may voluntarily submit such information through a "Wall of Fame" post or a public posting area on the Site, if such feature is available. If we have actual knowledge that a Child is sending or posting Personally Identifiable Information on any area of this Site, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such Personally Identifiable Information before it is made public. Please note that any online store that may be accessed from the Site is intended for parents, teachers and other adult purchasers over the age of 18 and requires the submission of Personally Identifiable Information to fulfil and service any transactions.

We may disclose a Child's Personally Identifiable Information if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose a Child's Personally Identifiable Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
