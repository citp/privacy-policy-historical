We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which the user has expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

## Order

We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

Front Gate Tickets will use information in aggregate to provide analysis of purchasing trends for the refinement of our software and customer service support, and for the benefit of our clients. Specific information will not be sold or distributed to any third parties without the consent from our customers at the point of data collection.

## Customer Profile

We store all information that we collect through the ordering process excluding the actual credit card number. We do NOT store credit card numbers in our database, nor is the credit card number stored at any point on our server, it is transmitted directly to Authorize.net. We do not use clear gifs, or third parties to create a profile or record of our customers.

## Log Files

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## Communications from the Site Special Offers and Updates

Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

## Newsletter

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

## Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

## Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.

## Sharing - Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law when we believe that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.

## Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

We share aggregated demographic information with our customers, partners, and advertisers in order to improve our software and customer service. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. As a matter of policy, we do not share users' personal information with any third party.

## Third Party Intermediaries

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. Front Gate Tickets is not responsible for their privacy policies.

## Service Providers

We partner with certain third parties to provide specific services. For example, internet connectivity, computer crime investigation, incident response, web hosting, etc. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except in conjunction with providing these services.

## Business Transitions

In the event Front Gate Tickets goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

## Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email or email us at [hello@frontgatetickets.com](mailto:hello@frontgatetickets.com).

## Surveys & Contests

The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be shared with the contest or survey sponsors and used to notify the winners and award prizes. The terms of a contest may provide, among other things, that the identities of the contest winners may be made public. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

## Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online庸or example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas葉hat information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return, and we take no responsibility for those situations.

## Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.
