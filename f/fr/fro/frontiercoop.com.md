**Privacy Statement**

> At Frontier, our customers are #1, and since we value our own privacy, we extend that to you as well. Because of this, we WILL NOT sell or share our customer information with anyone. We collect email information from those who wish to receive email from us (we do not send unsolicited email). We only save shipping and billing information if you have saved this information as part of your Customer Profile. Any information that is collected via "trails" (the trail you leave as you travel through our site) is only reviewed internally and then discarded. Your trust is important to us, and we will not do anything to violate that trust. 

**Return Policy**   
     This policy is effective beginning August 1, 2002.

>   1. Within 60 days of invoice date, Frontier will accept the return of any product on the basis of quality issues or shipping mistakes. 
>   2. Requests for product returns must be authorized in writing and receive approval from Frontier before replacement merchandise or credit memo will be issued. 
>   3. In order to receive full credit, all returns must be in saleable condition and accompanied with a copy of the invoice.

**Out of Stock Policy**

**Security**

> Here At Frontier, we use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to encrypt the information you send us when you place an order. Not only is it encrypted before it travels across the internet, it's also encrypted on our server, which is located behind a secure firewall. Also, once your order has been processed, we delete your credit card information as an added safety measure. 

**Information**

> We will not send unsolicited email. If you do get an unsolicited email from us, please contact us immediately at [customercare@frontiercoop.com](mailto:customercare@frontiercoop.com) and we will look into it.
