We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely, including taking the following safeguards:

  * Transferring data to the US. We only transfer data to storage providers in the US which are able to provide appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. 



Some of the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the United Kingdom. It may also be processed by personnel operating outside the United Kingdom who work for us, our group companies or for one of our suppliers. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your orders, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
