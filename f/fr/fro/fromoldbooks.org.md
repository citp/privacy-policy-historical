## From Old Books (this site)

I'm in the process of removing Google Analytics and Google Ads. The Google privacy policy below applies to pages where i have not yet done that.

If you choose to leave cmments, these are moderated by hand; you can contact me to have any comment you made removed at any time. Your real name is not published; if ou give a sock colour, that may be published along with the comment.

If you place an order, I store your name, email address, the items you ordered, and the amount; I don't store any payment details. I also store the colour of your socks, used as part of the key for the download area.

I do not share any personal information you give me except for what you write in public comments. I do not sell any data to third parties.

## Google Privacy Policy

This Web site has ads provided by Google, Inc. and its partners. They use cookies to serve these ads; your Web browser sends the cookie to Google each time you visit a page with ads, so Google learns about which Web sites you visit.

You can opt out of Google cookies by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

Google shares statistics about my visitors and their interests. Sadly, it doesn't tell me the colour of people's socks. But it tells me the numbers of people in each age group with given interests. You can [opt out of sharing demographic information](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) if you like, and then Google will no longer include your interests in the report they send me.
