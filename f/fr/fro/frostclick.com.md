In addition, FrostClick will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 13.

**What else should I know about my privacy?**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas that information can be collected and used by others.
