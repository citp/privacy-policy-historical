##### **1.9 The FrostWire Software and Anonymous Usage Statistics**

The FrostWire software does not collect any data about its users that can personally identify them. Nonetheless, FrostWire collects Anonymous Usage Statistics.

To prevent FrostWire from collecting the Anonymous Usage Statistics in your desktop client, go to Preferences > Advanced > Usage Statistics and unblock the checkbox nest to ‘Send anonymous usage statistics’. If you are using FrostWire’s Android client, go to the apps Settings > Notification and Other and tap on the Anonymous Usage Statistics box to deselect the option.

##### **3.0 How the FrostWire Client Works**

The FrostWire Client is a software application that runs directly on your machine (a desktop computer or a mobile device) that manages downloads. The FrostWire Client downloads files by trading pieces with other users on the BitTorrent network that are downloading or have downloaded the same files before. When you download or select to seed your downloaded files, other users will upload file pieces from you. Even though your IP address is associated with your file chunks and that information will be available to other users on the network, other users will not have any other information about you.

FrostWire does not track the files you transfer over the BitTorrent network.

  


##### **4.0 Data sharing with third parties**

As a general rule, FrostWire will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under court order or subpoena.

FrostWire may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating FrostWire's Terms and Conditions of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) FrostWire's rights or property, other FrostWire users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. FrostWire may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
