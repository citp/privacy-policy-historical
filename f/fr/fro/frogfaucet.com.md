First of all we need to understand what these terms mean. The term "cryptocurrency" is a direct translation of the English term «cryptocurrency, which means that electronic money protected by encoding. What functions designed to perform cryptocurrency? In today's world, a huge segment of business would be impossible without the so-called digital or electronic money. Because they allow you to pay for goods bought on the Internet, and not only.  Cryptocurrency  system one of the fastest and most reliable payment systems and remittances. Add to this that cryptocurrency not tied to banking institutions and are not controlled by government organizations around the world.  
About value and essence of the term "cryptocurrency" more clear. Now pay attention to the most famous representative cryptocurrency - Bitcoin. He takes his foundation as well as the term "cryptocurrency» from English. «Bit» is the smallest unit of information, and the «coin» - coin. Bitcoin is also recorded in the transcription - BTC. This reduction is popular among the authors who write on economic issues and on the stock exchange. The term "Bitcoin" is inseparable from the concept of cryptocurrency because he was the first, and became the most famous in the world.  
Now look at Bitcoin as currency. First of all it is a digital product with limited supply, and the low offer due to the fact that his algorithm is structured so that the network can function only Bitcoin 21 million coins. Currently, the BTC produced 14815675. And after the "Miner" obtain the last bitcoin, their numbers remain unchanged. Schedule of emissions registered in the program and is known in advance. The economic basis bitcoin based on deflationary model, and it causes some concern to economists. They doubt whether this will be enough of a relatively small number of coins for everyday calculations. Although 1 Bitcoin is divided into 100,000,000 particles, which in honor of the founder of Bitcoin, called "Satoshi", and this makes it possible to operate with almost unlimited volumes of cryptocurrency. Also referred to as "millibitcoin" and microbitcoin "- is one thousandth and one millionth of Bitcoins, respectively.  
31 October 2008, with the publication of a fundamental document, began to develop the concept of Bitcoin. Published this person working under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Interestingly, in spite of numerous journalistic investigations, until today failed to find the real creator of Bitcoin.  
And on January 3, 2009, at 18:45 GMT, the network was generated by the first unit, it was the so-called "Genesis" - the block. And on this day all over the world celebrate the birthday of Bitcoin.

If you make this during your free from main work time, you won’t earn big funds, however, you can enable a quite pleasant addition to your primary income. Someone twines wreathes of vine and sells them, someone collects ancient coins or rare notes, which is a long-term investment, someone paints, sings, or makes cool sailing ship models – this all can bring a good income. Someone would regret having a hobby and say that his or her free time is passed by surfing the world network.

Quite many Internet-markets exist that sell their goods or services for Bitcoins. This crypto-currency slowly gains the status of the network gold, because it demonstrates great stability so far. Another crypto-currencies exist as well, but Bitcoin was the first one, the most people heard about it, it has the highest rate, which is 420$/BTC, and the biggest capitalization.

So how can you receive Bitcoin for free? There are specific websites that are called Bitcoin faucets, and they offer such a possibility. Such strange name was gained because these websites give crypto-currency by very small portions, but regularly like water drops from the faucet. The fact that you have to visit Bitcoin faucets regularly, makes the sense of their functioning, since their income is received from the ads placed on these websites. That is why you should deactivate the ad block programs when you visit Bitcoin faucets (well, most websites just won’t let you in, if the ad blocker is on).

In addition, you have to create a Bitcoin wallet. This is easy to do, network has a plenty of guides how to do this. When you visit a website with the faucet, you have to enter the Bitcoin wallet address in the corresponding field, enter a captcha, and wait until you get free Bitcoin.
