Cookies</b><br>
This website and Leadfruition.com generally only uses Cookies to allow visitors to access secure areas of a website or to monitor the flow of traffic on a website to ensure reliable, consistent service, and to deliver the best user experience. Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website.

<br><br>
The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by user intervention, or to delete cookies.

<br><br><b>
Children <br></b>
No applications on Leadfruition.com specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being from minors, users of Leadfruition.com should be aware that personally identifiable information submitted to Leadfruition.com by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as information given by an adult.
<br><br>
Fruition strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor in Internet use by minors.
