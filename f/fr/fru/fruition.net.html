<h2>Fruition Privacy Policy</h2>

    Collection of Information by fruition.net
In order to improve the content and usability of this website, the Fruition, LLC. automatically collects several categories of information from users. This information includes the following:
<br><br>
1. The apparent Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your Internet Service Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has an IP address assigned directly to it.
 <br>
2. The apparent Fully Qualified Domain Name ("Domain Name") of your Internet Service Provider ("ISP") and/or your computer, if your computer has a domain name assigned directly to it.
 <br>
3. The type of browser (such as, for example Netscape, Internet Explorer, Opera, Konqueror, etc.) used and the operating system resident on a user's computer.
 <br>
4. The date and time a user visited the site.
 <br>
5. The web pages accessed at the site, as well as any applications used and forms data.
 <br>
6. The Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the site which a user visited prior to fruition.net (if detectable), if such user did not connect directly to fruition.net, or use it as a homepage or "Portal.
 <br>
Fruition uses this information to identify site performance needs; to ensure compatibility with the technology used by fruition.net's visitors, and to generally add and improve services offered on fruition.net. In order to accomplish those goals, from time to time, Fruition may conduct statistical analysis of the data it collects.
<br><br>
Fruition does not collect data for commercial or marketing purposes, and <b>Fruition does not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute the data collected by fruition.net for commercial or marketing purposes</b>.
<br><br>
Information Submitted to fruition.net <br>

During a session on fruition.net, a user may affirmatively submit information to Fruition by, among other means, electronic mail ("e-mail"), by filling in and submitting an on-line form, or by electing to personalize fruition.net and use it as a customized portal. Such affirmatively submitted information is stored in a secure environment.
<br><br>
The purposes to which affirmatively submitted information may be put include, but are not limited to, the following:
<br><br>
1. Helping Fruition respond to a request for information not readily available from fruition.net
 <br>
2. Investigating a problem reported to Fruition via fruition.net.
 <br>
3. Assisting a client in resolving a hosting or connectivity issue.
 <br> <br>
Fruition does not rent or sell personally identifiable information (i.e., information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail, etc., that identifies a user as a particular person), nor would Fruition exchange or trade such information with third-parties without a user's explicit permission. Fruition does not disclose credit card or other personally identifiable financial information other than as necessary to complete a credit card or other financial transaction, or upon explicit permission from the applicable user. All such use by Fruition of financial information shall be subject to the section of this policy on financial issues, set forth below.
<br><br>
If a fruition.net user has elected not to receive further information from Fruition, fruition.net will not send such information. If an fruition.net user has elected to receive further communication from Fruition, fruition.net will only send information in categories that have been authorized. If fruition.net sends electronic mail ("e-mail") to a user, such e-mail is NOT confidential, and is identical in nature to that information generally available to the public and news media. 
<br><br><b>
Security <br></b>
In certain instances, a user may have the opportunity to receive or create a password to access or submit personally identifiable information. One should not divulge a password to anyone, and Fruition will never ask a user for a password in a telephone call, fax, e-mail or other form of unsolicited communication. When a user is finished with an application or applications that are password protected, such user should exit the relevant page(s). If the browser used to access said password protected pages is a publicly-accessible browser, users should close down the entire session and, if applicable or possible, flush any temporary caches or other areas where such a password might be stored subsequent to use.
<br><br>
Fruition has integrated industry standard or better security measures and systems into the design, implementation and day to day operation of fruition.net and its underlying servers and networks. Furthermore, Fruition maintains ongoing efforts to identify and/or block unauthorized intrusions into or onto fruition.net, and to upload to or change information on or otherwise cause damage to fruition.net or the information resident hereon or submitted hereto.
<br><br><b>
Cookies</b><br>
This website and fruition.net generally only uses Cookies to allow visitors to access secure areas of a website or to monitor the flow of traffic on a website to ensure reliable, consistent service, and to deliver the best user experience. Cookies are text files, or entries in larger files, utilized to distinguish between visitors to a website, and to track information during multiple visits to a website. Fruition uses "temporary cookies" on some parts of fruition.net, and such temporary cookies expire upon the end of the browsing session. If a user registers to use fruition.net as a customized portal, Fruition uses a persistent cookie to facilitate such customization.
<br><br>
The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet websites. Most Internet web browsers may be customized to reject cookies, to only accept or reject cookies by user intervention, or to delete cookies. Rejecting and/or removing cookies, however, may lead to loss of functionality on those fruition.net pages requiring cookies to function fully. Additionally, if a user has created a customized version of fruition.net, Fruition will create a cookie that contains the user's unique identifier and indicator for any custom content modules requested.
<br><br><b>
Web Bugs (a/k/a Web Beacons) <br></b>
fruition.net does not use web bugs on its web pages or in any html e-mail generated by use of the portal, or otherwise sent from fruition.net, for any purpose other than to identify site performance needs; to ensure compatibility with the technology used by fruition.net's visitors, and to generally add and improve services offered on fruition.net.
<br><br><b>
Children <br></b>
No applications on fruition.net specifically solicit information from minors or seek to determine whether the visitor is a minor. Consequently, because such information will not be specifically identified as being from minors, users of fruition.net should be aware that personally identifiable information submitted to fruition.net by minors will be subject to being treated in the same manner as information given by an adult.
<br><br>
Fruition strongly believes that parental supervision is an important factor in Internet use by minors. Therefore, fruition.net asks parents to guide their minor children when children are asked to provide any personal information online. fruition.net further asks that children ask for and receive their parent's permission before providing any information online. 
<br><br><b>
Health Care Information <br></b>
Any agency providing personally identifiable health care information via fruition.net will be required to certify that its health care data handling and security procedures are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"). If such data and security services are provided to such agency(ies) by a third-party provider, the agency(ies) shall be responsible for such third party's compliance with HIPAA.
<br><br><b>
Third Party Links <br>
</b>fruition.net provides links to, and may be linked from or to other websites. The existence and/or provision of those links neither constitutes nor implies endorsement of the destination or departure website(s) or of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policy(ies), product(s), accessibility or privacy policy of said destination or departure website(s). Nor does any link between fruition.net and a third-party website imply sponsorship of such website, or the creator of such website.
<br><br>
Some content on portions of fruition.net resides on servers run by third parties. Each agency providing content for fruition.net is bound by fruition.net's privacy policy. Any agency using a third-party host, ISP, ASP or other combination of third-party transport, storage, content or application provision services shall be responsible for such third party's compliance with fruition.net's privacy policy.
<br><br>
<b>Intellectual Property <br>
</b>The content of fruition.net's webpages is copyrighted, and contain some third party images/graphics that are used with permission. Users are notified, therefore, that one should presume the need to obtain permission from the copyright holder before reproducing or otherwise using images/graphics from this website.
<br><br>
fruition.net may change this policy from time to time, and reserves the right to do so without notice.
