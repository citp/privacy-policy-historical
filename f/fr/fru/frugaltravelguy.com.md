    * to satisfy any applicable laws or regulations,
    * to defend ourselves in litigation or a regulatory action,
    * in order to protect the rights or property of Internet Brands and our subsidiaries, including to enforce our sites' terms of use,
    * when we have a good faith belief that we are required to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a subpoena, court order, or search warrant),
    * where we believe our sites and services are being used in the commission of a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and risk management, and

If that is the case, both Internet Brands and the partner will receive personal information you provide.
  * We may share personal information about you for any other purpose(s) disclosed to you at the time we collect your information or with your consent.


* ### Other Information We Automatically Collect

We may also collect certain technical information when you use our sites and services. For example, our servers receive and automatically collect information about your computer and browser, including for instance your IP address, browser type, domain name from which you accessed the site or service, and other software or hardware information. If you access our sites and services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device (UDID), type of device, general GPS location, or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it.

In addition, we may collect information about how you use our sites such as the date and time you visit the sites, the areas or pages of the sites that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing the sites, the number of times you return to the sites, and other click-stream data. Some of this data may be shared with partners who referred you to our site(s) and who will use the data to optimize who else they refer to our site(s). Also, sometimes this data can be shared with partners who help us deliver ads to you on websites not controlled by us, for instance, when we put a pixel on a conversion page on our site and a marketing partner uses that to optimize what traffic they send to us, or using another example, when we create a re-targeting list through DFP Small Business by Google or placing a partners’ pixel on our sites, and then delivering targeted ads across the Internet.

We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology).

You can set your browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Adobe Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of our sites and services. Please note that companies delivering advertisements on our sites may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.

You can opt out of being targeted by certain third party advertising companies online by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp), [Omniture](http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&popup=1&locale=en_US&second=1&second_has_cookie=0), [Aperture](http://rt.displaymarketplace.com/optout.html), [PrivacyChoice](http://www.privacychoice.org/privacymark) and/or [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/).

In general, we use these technologies to remember you when you return to our sites, to understand and analyze trends, to monitor usage and administer the sites, to learn about user behavior on the sites and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, to customize content or offers on our sites and through our services, and to conduct research to improve our sites, content and services.

* ### User Generated Content, Online Communities and Forums, Profiles and Reviews

You may choose to publicly disclose personal information about yourself and others in the course of (i) contributing user generated content (for instance articles, blogs, reviews or podcasts), (ii) communicating with others in our online forums, communities or chat rooms, (iii) creating user profiles for public view, or (iv) posting images, photos or videos. Be aware, information that you voluntarily disclose in any of these areas of our sites is unencrypted, public information and therefore, there can be no expectation of privacy or confidentiality. Any personal information you submit in the course of interacting in these public activities can be read, collected, or used by other users. Prior to posting in these areas, we encourage you to read the specific site's terms of use, as we are not responsible for the personal information you choose to make public in any of these areas.

* ### Accessing and Updating Personal Information

We encourage you to keep your personal information updated and accurate. We provide you reasonable access to your personal information and the ability to review, correct or delete it. For instance, some of our sites and services give you the ability to view and/or edit your personal information online. The methods for accessing your personal information will depend on which sites or services you use and their features. You have several choices, for instance:

  * To view and change the personal information that you directly provided to us, you can return to the web page on our site where you originally submitted the data and follow the instructions on that web page.
  * You may correct or update your account information at any time by logging on the site on which you are registered and navigating to your account.
  * You may deactivate your profile at any time by visiting the preferences page for your profile.
  * You may close your account at any time by logging on the site on which you are registered and navigating to your account.
  * You can manage certain aspects of information collection and use by going to the settings of your mobile device and reviewing the permissions of each application. You may stop further use of your geo-location by visiting your device's settings for the relevant application.
  * You may change your email preferences at any time by visiting your email preferences page for the relevant site.
  * If you have additional questions about your options, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20131026081921id_/http%3A//www.internetbrands.com/privacy/privacy-contact-form.php).



Protecting your privacy and security is important and we also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to your data.

Please be aware that certain records and information will be retained for specific purposes such as legal, payment, accounting, technical, dispute resolution, enforcement of our sites and services' terms of use, or customer service. If you have posted comments or user generated content on our site, we may not be able to delete it. Further, we take no responsibility for removing or editing any of your public activities or any submissions or content that is a result of your public activities, except as provided in this privacy policy or the sites or services' terms of use.

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law.

Requested communications include, for instance, email newsletters or software updates that may be expressly requested by you or which you consented to receive. After you request such communications, you may "opt out" of receiving them by using one of the following methods:

* ### Protecting Personal Information

We have implemented reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, technical and data security procedures and controls to safeguard your personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, misuse and alteration. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. We cannot assume responsibility or liability for unauthorized access to our servers and systems. We use third-party service providers to manage credit card and payment processing. These service providers are not permitted to store, retain, or use billing Information except for the sole purpose of credit card and payment processing on our behalf. When you enter payment information we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology and do not store it on our systems.

* ### Linked Websites and Services

Our sites and services may link to other sites or services operated by Internet Brands' affiliates or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by third parties. We do not exercise control over third party sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties. Once you leave our sites or services via a link, enable a third-party service, or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third-party's site. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.

We may also provide social media features on our sites and services that enable you to share personal information with your social network(s) and to interact with our sites and services. Depending on the features, your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of personal information about you. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media site(s) with which you interact.

* ### Children's Privacy

Our sites and services are intended for general audiences and are not targeted to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not disclose or provide any information. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to promptly delete the information.

* ### International Users

We are headquartered in the United States. Our sites and services are hosted in the United States or hosted with cloud service providers who are headquartered in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of our sites and services, may be processed in and transferred to and stored in the United States and will be subject to U.S. law. U.S. privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to the laws of your country of residence. By using our sites and services or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the United States.

* ### California Privacy Rights

We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information from a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites, for example. If you ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, since we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on an ongoing basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not "opt in" to such use when you provide personal information on one of our sites.

Users residing in certain jurisdictions, like California, have a right to access personal information held by us about them and their right of access can be exercised in accordance with applicable law. California law requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California residents asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the resident has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.

California residents may request further information about our approach to this law by writing to us. When writing to us, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the body or subject line of your request, and include (i) the name of the site about which you are contacting us, (ii) any unique site identifier associated with you (like member number or forum handle), (iii) your name, and (iv) your contact information. Please submit requests using our [Privacy Contact form](https://web.archive.org/web/20131026081921id_/http%3A//www.internetbrands.com/privacy/privacy-contact-form.php) and allow 30 days for a response. We will not accept requests via the telephone, mail, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.

* ### Contacting Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or our practices you can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20131026081921id_/http%3A//www.internetbrands.com/privacy/privacy-contact-form.php) or write to us at Internet Brands, Inc., Privacy Office, 909 N. Sepulveda Blvd., 11th Floor, El Segundo, California 90245 U.S.A.
