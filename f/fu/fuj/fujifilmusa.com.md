## Privacy Policy

Date last updated: November 1, 2010

**Our Commitment to Privacy.** FUJIFILM Holdings America Corporation (FUJIFILM) cares about your privacy. This Privacy Policy will help you better understand the online information practices that apply when visiting FUJIFILM’s site and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used.

Through FUJIFILM’s site, you will be able to link to sites maintained by FUJIFILM’s subsidiaries and affiliated companies, as well as unaffiliated third party sites. As more fully described below, each of these sites may be governed by a different privacy policy or statement. We suggest you check the privacy button typically located on each web page to access and review the applicable privacy policy or statement. For your convenience, we have posted links to privacy policies maintained by our subsidiaries on this page. Since privacy policies or statements may be changed periodically, we also suggest that you occasionally re-visit them.

**The Information We Collect.** The information we learn from visitors to FUJIFILM’s site helps us improve our site and provide better service to you. The information we collect falls into two broad categories: (1) information you voluntarily provide to us and (2) information that is automatically collected.

_Information you voluntarily provide to us._ Generally, you can visit FUJIFILM’s site without providing any personal information such as your name, mailing or email addresses, phone or fax numbers or credit card information. However, on some pages, we may request personal information in order to provide a service or carry out a transaction requested by you. We may also ask for feedback relating to our goods or services. Participation is voluntary and you are not required to provide this information. However, if you choose not to participate, we may not be able to perform a requested service or complete a transaction.

For example, you may be asked to provide your name, email address, mailing address and phone number when you create an account with us, enter a sweepstakes or contest, sign up for a newsletter, request product information or a product brochure, or correspond with us via email. To order products or services, you may be asked to provide additional information, including credit card information. You may also need to provide information for product warranty purposes.

While we sometimes store information you voluntarily provide to us, we generally will not provide that information to any third party or use the information for an undisclosed purpose except as otherwise noted at the point where the information is collected. To fulfill your orders for products and/or services, information you provide may need to be transmitted to and/or collected by a third party that provides services on our behalf, and, in such instances, we will make appropriate efforts to ensure that such providers do not further distribute your information such as requiring the third party provider to enter into a nondisclosure agreement. In addition, we may disclose information about you when we are required to do so (i) under applicable law or by legal process such as a court order, (ii) to prevent physical harm or property damage or (iii) as part of an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful conduct.

_Information Collected Automatically._ We also collect and store certain non-personal information that is generated automatically as you navigate through our site. Like many other companies, we use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" that enables us to place bits of text on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also relieve you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the site where you have previously entered preference information. We also use web beacons (also known as "single-pixel GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit our site or open email messages. We collect information about your computer’s connection to the Internet to allow us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on our site. We sometimes use the non-identifying and aggregate information that is collected as described above to enhance the design of our site and help us understand the needs of our visitors. 

**Links to Third Party Sites.** This site may contain links to third party sites that are not under the control of or maintained by FUJIFILM or our subsidiaries or affiliates. While we try to only link to sites that share our standards and privacy concerns, FUJIFILM does not control and we are not responsible for the content, security, privacy policies or the operation of third party sites. Further, if you opt to engage in transactions on third party sites linked to this site, such as purchases or promotions, we are not responsible and you must deal with the third party operators of such sites if any issues arise. As mentioned above, when visiting any site we suggest that you routinely review the applicable privacy policy or statement and other posted terms and conditions to understand your rights and options.

**Opting Out, Corrections and Contacting Us.** Occasionally, we will offer you the opportunity to “opt-out” or elect not to receive further emails from us. Generally, we will provide you an opportunity to opt-out at the point when you are asked to complete a user registration. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have implemented appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, we recognize that there may be times when you want to correct your personal information or have other concerns. Accordingly, we invite you to contact us should you have any such concerns regarding your information or our Privacy Policy and we will try and help you. Contact should be made via email at webquestions@fujifilm.com. 

**Our Special Commitment to Children’s Privacy.** Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our site from users who we actually know to be under the age of 13.

**Consent.** By accessing, browsing or otherwise using this site or any other site covered by this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to the collection, storage and disclosure of information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms Of Use.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy.** FUJIFILM reserves the right to change, amend, or update this Privacy Policy. If we do decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy. On return visits to our site, please remember to review the Privacy Policy for any changes, since continued use of our site after any posted revision indicates your consent to our use your information in accordance with the changed, amended, or updated Privacy Policy.

Thank you for visiting FUJIFILM’s site.
