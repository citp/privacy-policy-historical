## 3\. Use of Cookies, Webtools and Social Media Plug-ins

  1. 1. Use of Cookies and Webtools  
Various web tools (analysis programs and social media services) have been integrated into the Website(s) or App(s) that use “Cookies” or similar technologies. Cookies are text files that are sent by a web server to the user's browser or the App(s) in order to store information on the user's devices via the browser or Apps that is being used, for example the user's current IP address and information about the user. The next time the web server is accessed, the applicable information regarding the user is transmitted from the Cookie file.  
On this Website(s) or App(s), we have engaged some service providers to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from you. Such service providers may set cookies on behalf of us. We also use other third-party cookies to track the effectiveness of the Websites/App(s) and to advertise our products and services. Some of the web tools that track you include Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Marketo, and Facebook. 

You may deactivate the use of cookies via your browser settings at any time. Please note, however, that in this case you may not be able to make full use of the complete range of functions offered by the Websites.  
Some e-mails that we send you, such as personal correspondence, do not track you. However, other e-mails we send might include tracking mechanisms so that we can identify how much traffic those e-mails send to the Website(s) as well as whether an individual user has opened and clicked on the e-mail. If you want to be sure that none of your e-mail activity is tracked, please unsubscribe from our newsletters and marketing correspondence.

  2. 2. Social Network Plug-in  
On the Website(s), plug-ins for the social networks (“network”) have been or may be integrated. When you access the Website(s), these plug-ins can potentially create a direct connection between your browser and the server of the respective network. The content of the plug-in will be directly transmitted from the network to your browser, which will integrate it into the Website(s). We have no control regarding the scope of the data which is collected with the aid of the plug-in. The integrated plug-in informs the network that the user has accessed our website and informs the network of the user's IP address. If the user is logged in to the network of this plug-in at that point in time, the network will be able to link the visit with the user's account. 

If the user interacts with the plug-ins, for example in the case of Twitter by clicking on “Tweet This” or with Facebook by clicking the ‘I like' button or making a comment, the corresponding information will be transmitted directly from the user's browser to the network where it will then be stored. Furthermore, additional personal data may also be transmitted and stored there, for example the user's IP address, personal browser settings and other parameters.

If you are a member of the respective network and do not want it to collect information about you via the Website(s) and to link this information with the data that the network has already stored about you, then please close the Website(s), log out from your user account for the respective network and afterwards visit the Website(s) once again.

If you are not a member of the network or you have logged from the network before visiting the Website(s), the possibility still exists that the network will ascertain (at least) your IP address and store it. Please note that this information is already exchanged when you visit the Website(s), regardless whether you interact with the plug-ins or not.




## 4\. Children's Personal Information

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children defined by local laws. We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests.
