This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Fujifilm USA website [(http://www.fujifilm.com)](http://www.fujifilm.com/) and on the "Picture Your Life" website [(http://pictures.Fujifilm.com)](http://pictures.fujifilm.com/). The Fujifilm Worldwide website [(http://home.fujifilm.com)](http://home.fujifilm.com/) is not covered by this privacy notice nor are other countries' websites offered by Fujifilm Worldwide (such as Fujifilm's Brazilian website [(http://www.fujifilm.com.br)](http://www.fujifilm.com.br/) or Fujifilm's Swiss website [(http://www.fujifilm.ch)](http://www.fujifilm.ch/). This notice does not apply to other USA websites hosted by various Fujifilm divisions, such as [www.fujifilm.net](http://www.fujifilm.net/) or [www.fujifilmmediasource.com](http://www.fujifilmmediasource.com/). 

When you sign up for membership in Picture Your Life with Fujifilm at [www.pictures.fujifilm.com](http://www.pictures.fujifilm.com/), we ask for your name, e-mail address, and to select a user name and password. This information is stored and used to create an account for viewing and sharing photos online. Your user name and password are required to login and gain access to your membership account. You have the option to indicate on the registration form if you would like to receive promotional information as well as updates on new products and services from Fujifilm via email. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you specify that you would like to receive such materials. 

We offer online greetings by which you can personalize a greeting you create for another person. The information you provide to us to create an online greeting (such as recipient's name and email address) is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the greeting. 

When you enter a sweepstakes or contest, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can administer the contest and notify the winners. This information is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with outside parties. 

When you use the "Email this page to a friend" function, we ask for your name, email address and a friend's name and email address. You also have the option to include a personal message to send to a friend. This information is only used to send your message and is not stored by Fujifilm for any other purpose and is not shared with outside parties. 

When you submit a question or request information to Contact Us, we ask for your name, postal address, and e-mail address. If you do not have an email address, we offer the option to include a phone number so your question can be answered via phone if necessary. We collect this information to most effectively route your message to the appropriate support staff member in order to provide you a reply or send you the information you request. This information is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with outside parties. 

When you fill out an application for a grant or donation, you will leave the fujifilm.com website and enter the cybergrants.com website.

Fujifilm will not sell, trade, distribute or rent your personal information collected online to others (third parties) except for limited purposes as described above. 

**The Way We Use Information:**  
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to understand the needs of our site visitors. For example, we may track that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but this process does not involve disclosing anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Our Commitment to Data Security**  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

**Our Commitment to Children's Privacy**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**  
If you are registered for Picture Your Life with Fujifilm and any of your personal information changes or if you simply want to see what information we have stored, you can review and update your member profile using your user name and password by clicking "My Membership" on [www.pictures.fujifilm.com](http://www.pictures.fujifilm.com/). We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by changing it directly in "My Membership" on [www.pictures.fujifilm.com](http://www.pictures.fujifilm.com/) or by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
