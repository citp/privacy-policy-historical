All of these network plug-ins essentially work according to the same basic principle as described in the following:

When you access [www.fujifilm.eu](http://www.fujifilm.eu/), these plug-ins can potentially create a direct connection between the user’s browser and the server of the respective network. The content of the plug-in will be directly transmitted from the network to your browser, which will integrate it into the website. We have no influence regarding the scope of the data which is collected with the aid of the plug-in. Therefore, we can only inform you about the information which is publically accessible according to our current state of knowledge (see above). The integrated plug-in informs the network that the user has accessed the website [www.fujifilm.eu](http://www.fujifilm.eu/) and informs the network of the user’s IP address. If the user is logged in to the network of this plug-in at that point in time, the network will be able to link the visit with the user’s account. 

If the user interacts with the plug-ins, for example in the case of Twitter by clicking on “Tweet This” or with Facebook by clicking the ‘I like’ button or making a comment, the corresponding information will be transmitted directly from the user’s browser to the network where it will then be stored. Furthermore, additional personal data may also be transmitted and stored there, for example the user’s IP address, personal browser settings and other parameters.

If you are a member of the respective network and do not want it to collect information about you via [www.fujifilm.eu](http://www.fujifilm.eu/) and to link this information with the data that the network has already stored about you, then please close this website, log out from your user account for the respective network and afterwards visit our website once again.

If you are not a member of the network or you have logged from the network before visiting our Internet site, the possibility still exists that the network will ascertain (at least) your IP address and store it. Please note that this information is already exchanged when you visit our Internet site under the [www.fujifilm.eu](http://www.fujifilm.eu/), regardless whether you interact with the plug-ins or not.
