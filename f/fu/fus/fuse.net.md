# Cincinnati Bell - Customer Service - Resource Center - Privacy Policy

Cincinnati Bell knows how important personal privacy is to our customers. Cincinnati Bell maintains strict privacy policies and uses industry-accepted technologies to safeguard such information. 

As part of our commitment to our customers, Cincinnati Bell has adopted the following comprehensive privacy policy. 

Information Collection 

The information we collect depends on what you do when you visit our web site. There are two types of information that we are likely to record: 

  * **Non-personal information collected in the aggregate:** We do collect various "anonymous" facts each time you visit our site. This information includes the date and time you access our site, the internet address you use, what page(s) on the site you visited, the type of browser you use, etc. We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.
  * **Personal Information you give us:** We collect the personal information you provide directly to us in the course of conducting business on our web site. This information can include name, e-mail address, credit card numbers, etc. This personally identifiable information is only used to conduct business with you, provide you with specific services and communicate with you. We may also use this information to send you e-mails about new products and services. If you create a personal account with us and provide us with the above information for the purpose of conducting business, you authorize us to store your name, shipping address, credit card and billing information.



We Protect and Preserve Customer Privacy

We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to outside companies or marketing firms. We may share this information with other Cincinnati Bell entities (including without limitation our parent company, Cincinnati Bell Inc., its subsidiaries and its affiliates). We share personal customer information with our agents and trusted business partners only when required for the specific and limited purpose of providing products or services to you, such as to our shipper in order to fulfill an on-line order. 

Use of Cookies

A cookie is a small text file created by our web site and stored on your computer that assists us in providing customized services. The use of cookies is a standard in the industry and you'll find they're used at most web sites. We use cookies for login verification, session management, load balancing and personalization to enable your user experience. We never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not already voluntarily provided to us by you. Most cookies are "session cookies", meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case, you may not be able to use certain features on our site, including the "My Account" self service functionality. 

Security

Cincinnati Bell uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, including firewalls and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. Cincinnati Bell treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.

To help ensure the confidentiality of your personal information, it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

Linked Web Sites

Cincinnatibell.com is a web site that contains links to various other web sites. Please be aware that these other sites may have privacy policies that differ from Cincinnati Bell's policies. Cincinnati Bell assumes no responsibility for either the content that appears on linked sites or your privacy once you have linked to other sites.

As the industry and technology advance, the information contained in this privacy policy may be periodically updated. We will update this policy as required. This policy was last revised on 1/31/2002.

Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)
