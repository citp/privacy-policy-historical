**3\. How does Fusion Beads Use Customer Information?**  
Fusion Beads does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. This information is for our private records only. We use the information we collect to tell you about products and services offered by Fusion Beads, to respond to your requests, and to manage our website and offers and promotions. If you have signed up to receive electronic communications from us, we also use your information to provide you with promotional emails for our products, and for other marketing and advertising purposes. For example, based on the information you provide us, we may develop new products and services, determine the effectiveness of our advertising, or provide you with customized offers and information about our products. If you provide feedback on any of our products and services, we may use your feedback for any purpose. We will collect any information contained in your communication and will treat the information in the communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with laws or to respond to subpoenas or other judicial orders or to protect and defend the rights or property of Fusion Beads or third parties. We may also use and disclose your information in connection with a contemplated reorganization or reorganization of our business, in connection with financing or a sale or other transaction involving the disposal of all or part of our business or assets, including for the purpose of permitting the due diligence required to assess whether to proceed with a transaction. 

**4\. Children**  
We do not intentionally gather personal information about visitors to our web site who are under the age of 18. We only offer the web site to persons 18 years of age and older. If you are a parent or legal guardian and learn that your child has provided us with his or her personal information, we ask that you contact us and we will delete that information. 

**5\. Security of Customer Information**  
When you place orders, we provide the use of a secure server. The secure socket layer (SSL) protocol encrypts the information you input before it is sent to the web server. We then retrieve all orders using an encrypted connection, ensuring the safety of your personal and credit card information. All customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. We use a 256-bit encryption SSL certificate through Verisign to ensure the highest level of security when you place orders with us. SSL provides secure communication by combining the following two elements:   
**Authentication** \- A digital certificate is tied to a specific domain, and a certification authority (an independent and trusted third-party company - ours is Verisign) performs a number of checks to confirm the identity of the organization requesting the certificate prior to issuing it. In this way, the certificate may only be installed on the domain against which it has been authenticated, providing users with the assurance they need.   
**Encryption** \- Encryption is the process of transforming information to make it unintelligible to all but the intended recipient. This forms the basis of data integrity and privacy necessary for e-commerce. 

**6\. Third Party Websites**  
Our website may provide links to or advertisements from other websites that are operated by third parties. We provide these links for your convenience and we do not endorse such websites or their contents. We have no control over, and do not review, these websites or their content. Under no circumstances will Fusion Beads be responsible or liable, whether directly or indirectly, for any loss caused or allegedly caused by these other websites, including, without limitation, their content, the goods and services offered by them, or your reliance on them. We have not investigated, monitored or checked these other websites for accuracy, completeness, or conformance with applicable laws and regulations. If you leave this website and access these other websites, you do so at your own risk, and the rules and policies of the other websites will apply to you while you are on their websites. 

**7\. California Residents' Privacy Rights**  
Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business with whom the California resident has established a business relationship the following information: (1) the categories of information that Fusion Beads disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; (2) the names and addresses of third parties that received such information; and (3) if the nature of a third party's business cannot be reasonably determined from the third party's name, examples of the products or services marketed, subject to certain exceptions. You are entitled to receive a copy of this information in a standardized format and the information will not be specific to you individually. To exercise your rights, you may make one request each year by emailing us at [support@fusionbeads.com](mailto:support@fusionbeads.com) with "California Resident Privacy Information Request" on the subject line of your message. Be sure that your request provides enough information to properly identify you and/or the members of your family who are the subject of your request.
