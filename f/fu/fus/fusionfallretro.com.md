# FusionFall Universe - Privacy Policy

### [FusionFall Universe Privacy Policy](https://www.fusionfalluniverse.com/privacy-policy)

This policy explains in detail how "FusionFall Universe" along with its affiliated sites (hereinafter "we", "us", "our", "FusionFallUniverse.com", "FusionFall Legacy", "FusionFall Retro", "The FusionFall Universe Team", "FusionFallLegacy.com", "FusionFallRetro.com") use any information collected during any session of usage by you (hereinafter "your information").

Your information is collected in a couple ways:  


  * Browsing any of our sites listed above will cause the software to create a series of cookies, which are small text files that are downloaded onto your device's web browser's temporary files. These cookies are solely used for improving your user experience by keeping you logged in for the time allotted per a setting you choose when logging into any affiliated FusionFall Universe service. Do note that these cookies are used throughout our entire network of sites listed above so that logins remain consistent throughout such sites.
  * Using or playing any software/game provided by FusionFall Universe will report various information about your computer hardware for security and analytical purposes. This information is stored securely and does not reveal any personal or identifiable information relating to the user.



Your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable name (hereinafter "your username"), a personal password used for logging into your account (hereinafter "your password") and a personal, valid e-mail address (hereinafter "your e-mail"). Your information for your account on any of the FusionFall Universe affiliated sites is protected by data-protection laws applicable in the United States of America. Any information beyond your username, your password, and your e-mail address required by the FusionFall Universe website during the registration process is either mandatory or optional at our discretion. In all cases, you have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated e-mails. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure the information they deem 'private' is hidden from others using our services. Assistance is available on request by writing to help@fusionfalluniverse.com, and it is advised that you write us an e-mail and obtain a reply prior to registration so both parties (you and we at FusionFall Universe and all affiliated sites) ensure your information is kept secret.

Your password is ciphered so that it is secure. Keep in mind that using a similar password from sites outside of FusionFall Universe sites is not recommended. Your password is the means of accessing your FusionFall Universe account, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated with FusionFall Universe legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget your username or password to your account, you can use the "I forgot my username/password" link displayed on all FusionFall Universe login screens. This process will ask you to submit your username and/or your e-mail. The software will then generate a unique link which will therefore be sent to you that you can click on to reclaim your account.

FusionFall Universe and all affiliated sites reserve the right to change this policy as we expand and add to our growing community.
