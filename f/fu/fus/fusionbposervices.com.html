					<p><strong>Collection of your Personal Information :</strong> </p>
					<p>Fusion BPO Services collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. Fusion BPO Services also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.</p>
					<p>There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Fusion BPO Services. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by Fusion BPO Services for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Fusion BPO Services website.</p>
					<p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Fusion BPO Services public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Fusion BPO Services does not read any of your private online communications.</p>
					<p>Fusion BPO Services encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Fusion BPO Services so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Fusion BPO Services is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Fusion BPO Services and Fusion BPO Services family of websites.</p>
<p><strong>Use of your Personal Information : </strong></p>
<p>Fusion BPO Services collects and uses your personal information to operate the Fusion BPO Services website and deliver the services you have requested. Fusion BPO Services also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Fusion BPO Services and its affiliates. Fusion BPO Services may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>
<p>Fusion BPO Services does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Fusion BPO Services may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.

<p><strong>Use of Cookies : </strong></p>
<p>The Fusion BPO Services website use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenient feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Fusion BPO Services pages, or register with Fusion BPO Services site or services, a cookie helps Fusion BPO Services to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Fusion BPO Services website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Fusion BPO Services features that you customized. </p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Fusion BPO Services services or websites you visit.</p>
<p><strong>Security of your Personal Information : </strong></p>
<p>Fusion BPO Services secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Fusion BPO Services secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Statement :</strong></p>
<p>Fusion BPO Services will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Fusion BPO Services encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Fusion BPO Services is protecting your information.</p>
