This site uses cookies. ([What's a cookie?](http://www.netlingo.com/word/cookies.php))  
In order to fully utilize this website, users are required to complete our registration form. 

During registration a user must give certain contact information, but we never sell or give away this information, except in the case that you select "Yes" to opt-in to an offer displayed on our site. It is gathered only to contact the user about services on our site for which he or she has expressed interest and shared only with your consent. 

Registration is not required to access this site; however, most features require registration. 

We require additional information from the user in order to disburse payment. A user must provide information such as name, email, and/or mailing address in order to receive payment. 

When completing some offers, some or all of your contact information may be "pre-populated" on the advertiser's site. This industry-standard practice is intended to make the offer completion process easier. **Your contact information is not collected by the advertiser unless you "submit" the form.**

If you "opt-in" to an advertiser offer that has a "Yes/No" radio button next to it, FusionCash automatically transmits one or more of: email address, name, street address, and/or demographic information to the advertiser(s) you selected. 

Certain features of FusionCash, provided by third parties, require that we transmit one or more of: email address, name, street address, and/or demographic information. These parties are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only in conjunction with providing services on FusionCash. Further details can be found in Section VIII. of the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/web/20181010184918id_/http%3A//www.fusioncash.net/tos.php).
