We respect each site visitor's right to personal privacy. To that end, we collect and use information throughout our website only as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. This statement applies solely to information collected on this website.   
For each visitor to our website, our web server automatically logs information regarding the domain and/or IP address, time of access, referring site, and content accessed. The information we collect is: 

  * used to improve the content of our site,
  * used internally for marketing purposes,
  * used to prevent and respond to hacking and other illicit activities, and
  * never shared with other organizations for commercial or any other purposes. 
  * However, your registered email address and other information may be provided to certain affiliates when you click on an offer. This is merely to aid in fraud prevention and completion tracking. Said affiliates have strict privacy policies and will not send unsolicited commercial email.



This site uses cookies. ([What's a cookie?](http://www.netlingo.com/right.cfm?term=cookies))  
In order to fully utilize this website, users are required to complete our registration form. 

During registration a user must give certain contact information, but we never sell or give away this information. It is gathered only to contact the user about services on our site for which he or she has expressed interest. 

Registration is not required to access this site; however, most features require registration. 

We require additional information from the user in order to disburse payment. A user must provide information such as name, email, and/or mailing address in order to receive payment. 

When completing some offers, some or all of your contact information may be "pre-populated" on the advertiser's site. This industry-standard practice is intended to make the offer completion process easier. **Your contact information is not collected by the advertiser unless you "submit" the form.**

FusionCash sends three types of emails: 

  * email confirmation requests (when you sign up initially or change your email address or password)
  * offer completion notifications (when you are credited for completing an offer)
  * occasional newsletters (no more often than twice per calendar month)



You may [unsubscribe from newsletters](https://web.archive.org/web/20080624054702id_/http%3A//www.fusioncash.net/newsletter.php?unsub) at any time. Once unsubscribed, you will no longer receive the newsletter. 

For security reasons, we do not allow users to unsubscribe from account confirmation or completion notification emails. If you do not wish to receive those emails, simply cease logging in, as they are sent only when triggered by user actions.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement.
