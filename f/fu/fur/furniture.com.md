Cancellations and Returns  
---  
Should you wish to cancel or return your order, please refer to the following policies.  
What if I want to cancel my order?  
Change your mind after placing an order? That's not a problem. Orders can be cancelled as long as they have not been prepared for delivery by our delivery partners. To cancel your order, simply call us at (866) 965-3876 or email us at **[customerservice@furniture.com](mailto:customerservice@furniture.com)**. We will promptly refund your credit card. In some cases, a restocking fee and delivery fees may apply if you cancel your order after it has been picked up for delivery.  
What if I want to return my delivered item?  
  
We guarantee your complete satisfaction and want to make sure you are happy with the purchasing experience. If you have changed your mind on an item, no problem - we make returns easy. You can return your product within 7 days of delivery by simply calling us at (866) 965-3876 or emailing us at **[customerservice@furniture.com](mailto:customerservice@furniture.com)**. Your refund will exclude delivery fees and/or a restocking fee and can only be made if the merchandise is in "as-new" condition. To be eligible for return, mattresses and box springs must have law tags attached, be in their original, sealed factory wrapping, and be in sanitary condition, clean and free of tears, burns and stains of any kind. Please note, due to state regulations, mattresses and box springs cannot be returned in West Virginia.

We do our best to make your delivery successful. However, sometimes issues may arise that are beyond our control. If you need additional assistance, please reach out to our Customer Care team within 48 hours of delivery.

Secure Shopping  
We make certain that we never share the information you've shared with us. We also make sure that your information is protected as you send it to us.  
  
Our secure server software (SSL) is among the best technology available today. It encrypts (scrambles in code) all personal data you share with us, including your credit card and telephone numbers, name and address. Furniture.com is so confident in our systems that we ensure 100% safety in the transactions you make with us.* 

*In the rare event that unauthorized charges are made to your credit card during a transaction with us, you will not be held responsible in any way. Under federal law, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50, Furniture.com will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. Furniture.com will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own, on purchases made at Furniture.com while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, in order to qualify for the Furniture.com security guarantee, you must undertake any steps required by federal law and your credit card agreement, including any provision requiring you to notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. If you have any questions regarding federal laws, contact your state's attorney general or the United States Department of the Treasury.
