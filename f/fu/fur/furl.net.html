              <h3>What information does LookSmart collect?</h3>
              <p>
                At different times, LookSmart may collect several types of information about you.  Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, we do not provide this information to third parties, except in aggregate form.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, LookSmart collects personal information when you register for the Furl.net service.  During registration, LookSmart requires a unique public member identity, private password, valid email address, first name and last name.  No other personal information is required for users to register for the Furl service.  Once you register, you are no longer anonymous to LookSmart.  Your member name and first and last name (which are of your choosing) are made public to the Furl community and general public.  Other registration information is not displayed publicly unless you opt to display it publicly.  You may provide additional personal information at other times, including but not limited to, when you provide opinions or ratings, enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion, or when you report a problem with one of our features or services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, we or our partners or advertisers may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer but not you to our servers every time you visit our site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser's preference options, but if you do so you may not be able to utilize some services properly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third, we keep track of your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our site. Your IP address is a number that identifies a computer which accesses the Internet.  This address is used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your Internet service provider and the geographic location of your IP address. LookSmart may also collect aggregate information on how our users are utilizing the site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site and search queries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fourth, we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to our site and URLs viewed by visitors while on our site.  Again, LookSmart uses this information on an aggregate basis, in this case making sure we can support overall visitor traffic and service performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fifth, we contract with service partners 24/7 Real Media and WebSideStory, to provide us with data collection and reporting services to better understand overall use of our site. These service partners may store certain legacy data that we received from visitors to our site prior to our relationship with them, so that we may access this information via their reporting service.  These service partners may collect information on our behalf about our users' visiting behaviors in several ways, including through the use of cookies or pixel tags.  We use these service partners to understand what's popular and useful for visitors.  Our service partners are contractually prohibited from disclosing this information to any third party.

              <h3>What organization is collecting the information?</h3>
              <p>
                LookSmart usually collects the requested information. However, LookSmart has chosen select partners to provide certain services. To use certain services on the site, it may be necessary to enter information that then goes to our partner and is not kept by LookSmart. The areas of our site in which partners are collecting information may be cobranded with our partners' logos.  If you have questions regarding the privacy policy or data collection practices of one of our content partners, please contact that partner directly.

              </h3>
              <p>
                We use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to collect information and serve ads to you when you visit our site.  These companies may use cookies, pixel tags, or otherwise independently collect information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) from you and use this information about your visits to this and other sites to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  We do not control their collection and use of information.  Please note that if an advertiser or advertising network asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or advertising network may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
              </p>
              <p>

              <h3>What does LookSmart do with the data it collects?</h3>
              <p>
                Whenever LookSmart collects data, the data is intended to tailor or improve the experience of visitors to our site. From the data collected we can customize content and advertising based on the user's preferences. We may use information from cookies to differentiate between unique users, personalize the site for each unique user, to control the frequency of individual advertisements directed to individual computers, and other purposes. In all cases, personally identifiable information is not shared with our advertisers, except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site.  It's the way we can make sure our service is consistently available to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you register for a service or to enter a sweepstakes, we may use the information we collect to provide the service to you or send communications regarding the sweepstakes.  We may also send a newsletter by email to our users who opt to receive such emails.  It is our policy to send these emails only to users who give us permission to do so. In every such email, we will also have instructions on how to unsubscribe to avoid receiving any future emails from us.  LookSmart also may contact you by email to respond to feedback you have submitted.

              <h3>With whom does LookSmart share data?</h3>
              <p>
                LookSmart shares your member name with other Furl users.  Your member name is the one part of your member profile that always remains public.  Because many Furl services are interactive and community driven, it is important for other users to know who has submitted content, ratings, and comments. LookSmart may also disclose your personal information to it other owned and operated businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also may disclose your personal information (including without limitation IP addresses) to a third party if the law or legal process requires it, to protect the rights or property of LookSmart or others, or as otherwise described in this privacy policy.
              </p>

                Your Furl account can be deactivated and personally identifiable information deleted, but doing so will result in not being able to access Furl services outside of using a non-registered account.  Please contact <a href="mailto:furl@furl.net">Furl@furl.net</a> if you wish to deactivate your account, clearly indicating the nature of your request.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Your Furl account is password protected so that you and only you have access to entering and editing your personal information and personal preferences.  We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  LookSmart will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited call or unsolicited email.  Please remember to log out of your Furl account and close your browser window when you have finished your work.  This helps ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café.  Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, LookSmart has taken measures to ensure that information that is not publicly available through its site is accessible only to the user who initially entered the information or to authorized personnel at LookSmart or its partners, and only after a password has been entered.  In the unlikely event of a security breach for which we provide notice under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.82, LookSmart will send a notification to the email address on file (if any) for each relevant user informing him or her of the security breach.

                What about privacy policies for sites to which Furl links?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Furl contains many links to Web sites not controlled by LookSmart. These sites have their own policies and practices with respect to online privacy, and LookSmart cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these Web sites.

              <p>
                It is possible that Furl and/or any of LookSmart's assets may be acquired. In such a transaction, user information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. While we will endeavor to require the successor company to maintain this privacy policy, we cannot guarantee that our policy will remain in effect.

                LookSmart does not intentionally collect personal information about children under the age of thirteen (13).  Children under the age of thirteen (13) may not register for Furl or use the site.
