Google Adwords| AdWords ads are served on Google's own websites, the Google Display Network (other sites), AdSense and AdMob programs on third-party partner sites and services (such as applications and other clients). Beyond Google Analytics and DoubleClick cookies, Google uses cookies to help businesses that buy ads from Google determine how many people who click their ads end up purchasing their products. The conversion tracking cookie is set when you click an ad. It does not collect direct details. Each advertiser gets a different cookie, so no cookie can be tracked across advertiser websites. If you want to disable conversion tracking cookies, you can set your browser to block cookies from the googleadservices.com domain. For the Google Display Network and AdMob network, we serve ads based on the content of sites you've viewed or the application you're using on your device and may also use other partner data to target ads.
