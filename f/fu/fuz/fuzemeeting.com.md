# Fuze Meeting Privacy Policy

Fuze Meeting respects your privacy. When using our sites, you may get information, access online products and services, communicate with us or link to other web sites with which we do business. While doing that, you may give us information so that we can provide enhanced products or services to you and to personalize your experience on our website. This online privacy policy describes how we use and protect Personally Identifiable Information that you share with us ("PII").

The following principles govern web-sites owned and operated by Fuze Meeting. These principles do not govern web-sites of other parties to which we may provide only links because Fuze Meeting is not responsible, and cannot control the privacy practices or content of those sites.

## Information Collection and Use

Fuze Meeting collects PII when you register for a Fuze Meeting account or use the Fuze Meeting products or services for the following purposes:

  * To deliver the products and services you or your company have ordered for your use from Fuze Meeting.
  * To maintain accounting and billing contact information and other financial records.
  * To customize the advertising and content you see.
  * To contact you regarding our services unless you elected not to receive these communications.



When you register with Fuze Meeting, we ask for your name, email address, physical address, telephone numbers and, in some cases credit card information when you order services on-line. Some of our customers use Fuze Meeting services to provide sessions, such as web seminars, which require the participants to register prior to attending the session. When you register for one of these sessions, you may be asked to provide additional information such as your birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. This information is provided to the customer hosting the session. Fuze Meeting may store this information on behalf of our customers as necessary to fulfill our obligations to our customers. Fuze Meeting requires that all such customers use, hold and process such PII in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Fuze Meeting also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Fuze Meeting cookie information and the page you requested. Fuze Meeting routinely collects information that cannot be identified to a particular individual such as time-stamps and logs events (like features used, number of participants, length of meetings.) This data is used for accounting/billing purposes as well as for performance and optimization of the Fuze Meeting services.

## How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

Like many websites, Fuze Meeting uses technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, which allow us to make your visit to our website easier, more efficient and more valuable by providing you with a customized experience and recognizing you when you return. A cookie is a small data file transferred by a website to your computer’s hard drive. The Fuze Meeting website sends cookies when you visit, make a purchase, request or personalize information, or register yourself for certain services. A cookie cannot read personal data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about your browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize your experience and track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.

Cookies are typically classified as either "session" cookies or "persistent" cookies.

  * Session cookies do not stay on your computer after you close your browser
  * Persistent cookies remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire



You may browse most of the Fuze Meeting website without accepting cookies; however, some website functionality may be lost by disabling cookies on your computer. Other Fuze Meeting web pages, particularly those which require a login and password, require cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled cookies in your browser.

Fuze Meeting may also use customized links or other similar technologies to track email links that you click. We may associate that information with your Personal Information in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase information. Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication.

If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website or via HTML-formatted emails, you can set your browser to warn you before it accepts cookies or refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser.

For additional information about cookies and other tracking technologies, including instructions for blocking their use, see <http://privacy.getnetwise.org/browsing/tools>

Third party cookies may be used to identify your interest in Fuze Meeting. This information is used to determine if Fuze Meeting ads should be occasionally displayed on some web sites you visit. The information collected is anonymous and is not linked to your personal information. You may choose to decline cookies from third-party ad servers, which Fuze Meeting does not control. Third-party advertisement servers are subject to their own privacy policies.

## Retention and Relevance

If we change any of our privacy policies or practices, we'll post those changes to this policy statement at least 30 days before they take effect. In limited cases, we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.
