We may use your personal data to personalise our offering and to provide you with more relevant ads and services, for example, recommend jobs or training content.

### Do we share personal data?

Users use our services for their own personal development or for interacting with other Users. Your personal data is shared in the following ways:

 **Users you share and communicate with:**

FUZU service includes various forms of communication and sharing with other users. Different scenarios include:

 **Applying for a job:**

When you apply for a job you consent to sharing of your personal data, including application data and test results, with the employer.

 **Headhunting:**

You may also decide to share your profile with the employers for headhunting purposes, who can then access your personal data limited to your user profile and test results, such as personality profile used for applying for jobs. In headhunting mode your contact information is not shared, but will require separate consent from you. Visibility to headhunters can be managed under user settings.

 **Direct communication with other users:**

Your private communication with other users, both individuals and employers, remains private to you and the other party.

 **Career Hub:**

All activities conducted in Career Hub, including taking courses and tests are by default private and cannot be seen by other users. You may choose to take a skill test to verify and accredit a skill, which can then be published on your profile or shared proactively with other users.

 **User updates**

Updates and postings on FUZU are by default visible to all FUZU Users, unless targeted for a specific group of users.

Please consider carefully before disclosing any personal data or other information that might be accessible to other users.

### Sharing within FUZU companies or third parties:

We may share your personal data with FUZU companies or third parties who process personal data for FUZU for the purposes described in this Policy. This may include for example billing through your network service provider or otherwise, delivery of your purchases, providing services including customer service, managing and analysing consumer data, credit checks, conducting research and managing marketing and other such campaigns. When you purchase a FUZU service from us with a network service provider plan, we may need to exchange information with your network service provider to provide you with such service.

Sharing of information with third parties includes entities providing advertising, measurement and analytics services.

We want our advertising to be as relevant and interesting as the other information you find on our Services. With this in mind, we use all of the information we have about you to show you relevant ads. We do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying demographic information (such as 18 year old female, in Nairobi, who likes software engineering) to these partners to help them understand their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by our advertiser guidelines.

These authorised third parties are not permitted to use your personal data for any other purposes. We require them to act consistently with this Policy and to use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data.

  *  **International transfers of personal data**

Our products and services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world. Therefore your personal data may be transferred across international borders outside the country where you use our services, including to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) that do not have laws providing specific protection for personal data or that have different legal rules on data protection, for example, the United States of America. In such cases we ensure that there is a legal basis for such a transfer and that adequate protection for your personal data is provided as required by applicable law, for example, by using standard agreements approved by relevant authorities (where necessary) and by requiring the use of other appropriate technical and organisational information security measures.

  *  **Mandatory disclosures**

We may be obligated by mandatory law to disclose your personal data to certain authorities or other third parties, for example, to law enforcement agencies in the countries where we or third parties acting on our behalf operate. We may also disclose and otherwise process your personal data in accordance with applicable law to defend FUZU’s legitimate interests, for example, in civil or criminal legal proceedings.




 **New owner: p If the ownership or control of all or part of our Services or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.**
