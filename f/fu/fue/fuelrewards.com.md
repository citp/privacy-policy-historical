The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain the types of information that Excentus collects from you, what we do with this information, and with whom we share this information. This Privacy Policy includes information that we may collect from you in connection with our Fuel Rewards® program, also known as the Fuel Rewards NetworkTM program (“Fuel Rewards® Program”). Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, and how we seek to safeguard your Personally Identifiable Information.

#### **Jurisdiction**

The Excentus Sites are controlled by us from the United States; accordingly this Privacy Policy, and our collection, use and disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information or other information, is governed by U.S. law, and not by the laws of any country, territory or jurisdiction other than the United States. We do not represent or warrant that the Excentus Sites, or any functionality or feature thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction other than that of the United States. Those who choose to download, access or use the Excentus Sites do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules, and regulations. By downloading, accessing, using or submitting any Personally Identifiable Information or other information to the Excentus Sites, users from outside the United States acknowledge that the Excentus Sites are subject to U.S. law, and consent to the transfer of their Personally Identifiable Information or other information to the United States and any other jurisdiction, which may provide a different level of data security than in their country of residence, and waive any claims that may arise under their own national laws.

#### **Types of Information**

The following are descriptions of the types of information we may acquire from or about you:

  * We may receive and store any Personally Identifiable Information and other information that you provide to us, directly or indirectly, such as by searching on the Excentus Sites, creating an account, enrolling in our programs, communicating with us by phone, email, text or otherwise, interacting with Excentus and our affiliates through social media accounts or pages, completing a registration form, Excentus questionnaire or contest entry form, providing reviews, using specific features of your mobile device or otherwise interacting with Excentus and/or the Excentus Sites, and/or by contacting Excentus.
  * We may receive and store Personally Identifiable Information and other information from other sources, such as participating retailers, online merchants, manufacturers, restaurants, bars, clubs and other participants who issue and/or fund rewards, and participating fuel stations who redeem rewards (“Participants”). Examples of information we receive include account information, enrollment information, transactional information, reward issuance or redemption information, geographic information, and other purchase-related information.  We treat the Personally Identifiable Information and other information we receive from other sources in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  We may add this information to any Personally Identifiable Information or other information that you provide to us.

The most common sources of this information include cookies (including flash cookies as described in more detail below), web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), pixel tags or clear Graphics Interchange Format files, known as GIFs. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.

You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the  _[Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html)_  and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Excentus Sites or our online content. 
  * We may collect information about you from other sources and combine that with information we collect about you. For example, we may collect information to verify and update mailing addresses.

The Personally Identifiable Information enables us to conduct research and perform analysis in order to measure, maintain, protect, develop and improve our products and services and provide anonymous or aggregated reporting. It also enables us to customize and enhance the Excentus Sites, customize the content you see, administer sweepstakes, contests, promotions or surveys and make communications necessary to notify you regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues.

For example, we may allow you to sign in to your Fuel Rewards® Program account using Facebook Connect, and if you choose to sign in using Facebook Connect, you are authorizing Facebook to provide certain information to Excentus, such as your friend lists, birthday, check-ins, basic profile information and profile picture. We may use, disclose and retain such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, including to create and facilitate interactive social experiences, and to bring you products, services and programs from Excentus.

For example, if you choose to make information, which was previously non-public, available by enabling certain user features, Excentus will collect that information from your interaction and the information will become publicly available.

#### **Disclosure of information**

Information about our Members is an important part of our business. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

In addition, if you register for an offer that allows you to earn Rewards using your Linked Card (“Card Linked Offer”), MasterCard, Visa or American Express, as applicable, may share with Excentus details (including certain transaction data such as: date, time, merchant name and location, and amount) for your purchases and returns at Participants, so that Excentus can administer your Rewards and administer the Card Linked offer.

Excentus may engage third party marketers (“Third Party Marketers”) to introduce the Fuel Rewards® Program to potential merchants who may want to provide card-link enabled offers to you as part of the Fuel Rewards® Program. Excentus and these merchants may provide such Third Party Marketers transaction data (e.g., merchant ID, merchant location ID, last 4 digits of your registered payment card, dollar amount cleared and settled, and date of the settled transaction). The Third Party Marketer may use this transaction data for the sole purpose of invoicing the merchants for card-link enabled offers you participate in, and may not use this information for any other purpose.

Providing payment card information to us is not required for participation in the Fuel Rewards® Program; however, linking a payment card and providing payment card information is a requirement to receive card-link enabled offers and to participate in the Fuel Rewards® Dining Program.

If you enroll and participate in the Dining program as part of the Fuel Rewards® Program, we will provide your Personally Identifiable Information (including your Linked Card number) to Rewards Network Inc. ("Rewards Network") to allow Rewards Network to obtain details about your qualifying transactions from transaction information providers (like Payment Card Networks or Transaction Information Providers), administer the Dining program, and target personalized offers in connection with the Dining program.

We provide Personally Identifiable Information to third party service providers, subcontractors, and agents that work on our behalf to provide certain services. Examples of such services include providing marketing assistance, analyzing data, and providing customer service. These third parties are bound by law or by contract to protect the Personally Identifiable Information and have access to Personally Identifiable Information needed to perform their functions and for no other purpose.

Such reporting may include displaying your first name, last initial, and city and state of residence.

Excentus may provide aggregated demographic and statistical information to others for purposes of profiling activity, targeting personalized offers, marketing, promotion or similar activities. None of these statistics will identify users by name.

Excentus may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms and Conditions; (c) respond to claims that any content of an Excentus Site violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Excentus, its users, Members and the public.

We also collect information about you as a result of your participation in FRN™ Dining and use of our services. We refer to personally identifiable information that we collect as Personal Information. The type of Personal

Information we collect about you is described in the section below on "What Personal Information We Collect".  
Please read this privacy policy so that you can make informed decisions about participating in FRN™ Dining or using our services. By participating in FRN™ Dining or using our services, you agree to the provisions of this privacy policy. This privacy policy applies to current and former members of FRN™ Dining and anyone who uses our services.

Our Web site and mobile applications are hosted on servers located in the United States of America and are intended for use by United States residents. You may not use FRN™ Dining or any other service that we provide if you are not a United States resident.

Rewards Network Inc. and its affiliates operate FRN™ Dining and provide services to you. In this privacy policy, words like "we", "us" and "our" refer to Rewards Network Inc. and our affiliates, collectively. Our affiliates at the time this privacy policy was last updated are listed for you at the end of the privacy policy.

We offer Fuel Rewards Network™ (FRN) Dining ("FRN™ Dining") in connection with Excentus Corporation ("Excentus"), the owner and operator of the Fuel Rewards Network™.

#### **Your Privacy Protections**

We take several steps to protect your Personal Information. Among other things:

  * We will not disclose your Personal Information to any non-affiliated third party for use in marketing that party's goods or services without your consent, except that we disclose Personal Information to Excentus for use by Excentus in the operation of the Fuel Rewards Network™program, including the administration of Fuel Rewards® savings, and for marketing the Fuel Rewards Network™program, as permitted under its [Privacy Policy](https://www.fuelrewards.com/fuelrewards/privacy-policy) and you consent to our disclosure to Excentus of this Personal Information and Excentus' use of this Personal Information;
  * We will give you access to information that you have provided to us, including your name, how to contact you, credit, debit and other payment cards (which we refer to collectively as "payment cards") you have registered with FRN™ Dining and/or the Fuel Rewards Network™ program, and certain other preferences you have registered with us (we refer to this information as Registration Information), and we will allow you to correct any inaccuracies; and
  * We take data security seriously. While no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we take reasonable steps to protect the security of your Personal Information. See Section below called "Data Security" for more information on the steps we take to protect your Personal Information.



#### **What Personal Information We Collect**

We gather the following types of Personal Information in connection with your participation in FRN™ Dining and the provision of our services to you.

  * _Information you voluntarily provide to us._  When you register to participate in FRN™ Dining, you may provide us with Personal Information. We will also obtain Personal Information from Excentus when you are enrolled in FRN™ Dining by Excentus in connection with the Fuel Rewards Network™ program. This may include information such as your name, email and mailing address, other addresses (e.g. work, school), telephone number(s), payment card number(s) and expiration dates, loyalty program account numbers, username and password, the answer to a security question (in case you forget your password), special dates (e.g. birthday, anniversary), and dining preferences. You may also provide us with information regarding your personal accounts and/or profiles on third-party social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. You may provide us with Personal Information in connection with participating in contests, giveaways, sweepstakes, and other promotions, or in connection with completing surveys for us.
  * _Information we collect from your participation in FRN™ Dining or using our services._  We collect Personal Information from the payment network of your registered payment card, payment card processors and other entities that have access to payment card transaction information with respect to transactions that you pay for using your registered payment card at merchants that participate in the rewards programs that we operate. The merchants that participate in the rewards program we operate include merchants at which you may earn a benefit from FRN™ Dining and also merchants who are not available to you for earning a benefit but participate in other rewards programs that we operate. Benefits may not be available because (1) benefits are not offered on that day of the week or time of day, (2) benefits are not offered to members of FRN™ Dining, (3) benefits are not offered to you based on your member status or participation level in FRN™ Dining or (4) you otherwise do not qualify to receive a benefit at that merchant. This means that we may receive information about transactions that you make at merchants even though you are not aware that the merchant participates in a rewards program that we operate and even though you do not receive a benefit with respect to that transaction. The information that we receive regarding registered payment card transactions at merchants who participate in the rewards programs that we operate include the merchant you visited, the date of your visit, the amount of your bill and the payment card used to pay. In addition to transaction information, we also collect other information from your participation in FRN™ Dining or using our services, including information regarding visits to the websites that we operate, email confirmations when you open an email from us if your computer supports such capabilities, information about your location if you use the "current location" feature of our mobile smartphone application or mobile website and general usage information for our mobile smartphone application. We also collect information from your use of our customer services, such as information when you send us an inquiry, comment or request including any email or mailing address or telephone number you provide so that we may respond.
  * _Information obtained about you from others._  We may also collect Personal Information from merchants or other parties who do not participate in FRN™ Dining. For example, we may work with firms that provide us demographic information in order to evaluate or improve our services to you. We may collect transaction information from merchants who are considering joining our rewards programs in order to determine activity by members of the rewards programs that we operate at that merchant. We may also collect information with your consent or as required by law.



#### **Use of Personal Information**

We use Personal Information to operate our business and provide products and services to you.

#### **Retention and Disposal of Information**

We retain Personal Information as long as we determine is required for operation of our business and to meet legal, regulatory and other requirements. We take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is disposed of securely when we no longer require such data.

Personal Information is stored for the most part electronically in our computer systems or the computer systems of non-affiliated third parties that we work with in connection with operating our business, operating FRN™ Dining or providing services to you. We may have Personal Information on electronic and non-electronic media. The measures we take to protect Personal Information are described in the section below on "Data Security".

#### **Access to Information**

We restrict access to Personal Information to those individuals or entities that require access to that information in order for us to operate our business, operate, manage, and expand our products and services and provide products and services to you.

#### **What Personal Information We Disclose**

We may disclose Personal Information to non-affiliated third parties, such as suppliers, vendors or contractors, as necessary for the non-affiliated third party to provide services to us (such as printing or mailing services or otherwise) in connection with operating our business, operating, managing, and expanding our products and services, and providing products and services to you, such as our mobile smartphone application.

We also may disclose any Personal Information we collect with our affiliates, including for purposes such as for internal audit, management, billing or administrative purposes including protecting FRN™ Dining and its members from losses, and to protect our rights. We may also disclose Personal Information as necessary for defending and bringing legal actions.

We may disclose Personal Information if required by a government authority or legal process, which may include location data from your use of our mobile smartphone application.

We will not disclose your Personal Information (such as your email address) to non-affiliated third parties for such parties' use in marketing their goods or services without your consent.

We may obtain your consent to share information with non-affiliated third parties in various ways. For example, we may invite you to participate in a survey or special promotional program offered by a non-affiliated third party and your choice to participate in such a survey or promotional program will indicate your consent for us to share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties in connection with the survey or promotional program. If you consent to such disclosure, any information that you provide to the third parties will be controlled by that party's privacy policy, not our privacy policy.

You may also give us permission to use and post information about your restaurant visits, restaurant reviews, and other FRN™ Dining activities on FRN™ Dining's social networking accounts such as Facebook or Twitter or on your own social networking accounts. The posting and display of this information on third party networking site is subject to, and governed by, the privacy policy and privacy settings of the various social networking sites and services. Before providing consent to post any information to such third party social networking sites, users should understand the privacy policies and practices of the third party responsible for that website.

We do not control the privacy policies of such third parties and we assume no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties.

#### **Communicating With You**

We may from time to time send special offers to you on behalf of selected companies that we think may be of interest to you. However, because we or our third party vendors (and not the selected company) would send such offers to you, it is not necessary to disclose Personal Information to the company in order to send these offers to you. You may choose to opt out of certain of our marketing communications while still receiving other types of our marketing communications. We also may send you offers for goods or services sold by us or our affiliates, including in our email newsletters, by email or ordinary mail, or by telephone.

We will allow you to choose not to receive FRN™ Dining promotional communications from FRN™ Dining. For example, if you do not want to receive FRN™ Dining promotional communications, you may unsubscribe or opt out from such FRN™ Dining promotional communications by clicking the link included at the bottom of each FRN™ Dining email message we send to you or by changing your communication preferences via the Fuel Rewards Network™ program website at [fuelrewards.com](https://www.fuelrewards.com/) (the “FRN™ Website”).  You also can choose to not receive special offers we send on behalf of other companies. Please read the section entitled "Reviewing, Changing Your Registration Information or Unsubscribing" for details on how to request not to receive these FRN™ Dining promotional communications.

If you use our mobile smartphone application and allow the mobile smartphone application to access your location data, we may send to you marketing messages and other information based on your location when you are using the application. You may change the settings on the mobile smartphone application at any time to stop allowing the mobile smartphone application access to your location data.

#### **"E-mail a Friend" Information**

You may use our Email a Friend service to send restaurant review to family and friends via email. We will automatically send a one-time email inviting your family and friends to visit the specific restaurant page on [frndining.com](http://www.frndining.com/).

## Dining Program Privacy Policy

#### **Our pledge to you, our Member**

We respect your privacy and want you to know how we collect and share personally identifiable information about you. We have prepared this privacy policy to describe to you how we collect and share your personally identifiable information.

We need to collect information from you in order for you to participate in FRN™ Dining or use our services. We also collect information about you as a result of your participation in FRN™ Dining and use of our services. We refer to personally identifiable information that we collect as Personal Information. The type of Personal Information we collect about you is described in the section below on "What Personal Information We Collect".

Please read this privacy policy so that you can make informed decisions about participating in FRN™ Dining or using our services. By participating in FRN™ Dining or using our services, you agree to the provisions of this privacy policy. This privacy policy applies to current and former members of FRN™ Dining and anyone who uses our services.

Our Web site and mobile applications are hosted on servers located in the United States of America and are intended for use by United States residents. You may not use FRN™ Dining or any other service that we provide if you are not a United States resident.

Rewards Network Inc. and its affiliates operate FRN™ Dining and provide services to you. In this privacy policy, words like "we", "us" and "our" refer to Rewards Network Inc. and our affiliates, collectively. Our affiliates at the time this privacy policy was last updated are listed for you at the end of the privacy policy.

We offer Fuel Rewards Network™ (FRN) Dining ("FRN™ Dining") in connection with Excentus Corporation ("Excentus"), the owner and operator of the Fuel Rewards Network™.

#### **Your Privacy Protections**

We take several steps to protect your Personal Information. Among other things:

·     We will not disclose your Personal Information to any non-affiliated third party for use in marketing that party's goods or services without your consent, except that we disclose Personal Information to Excentus for use by Excentus in the operation of the Fuel Rewards Network™program, including the administration of Fuel Rewards® savings, and for marketing the Fuel Rewards Network™program, as permitted under its [Privacy Policy](https://www.fuelrewards.com/fuelrewards/privacy-policy) and you consent to our disclosure to Excentus of this Personal Information and Excentus' use of this Personal Information;

·     We will give you access to information that you have provided to us, including your name, how to contact you, credit, debit and other payment cards (which we refer to collectively as "payment cards") you have registered with FRN™ Dining and/or the Fuel Rewards Network™ program, and certain other preferences you have registered with us (we refer to this information as Registration Information), and we will allow you to correct any inaccuracies; and

·       We take data security seriously. While no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we take reasonable steps to protect the security of your Personal Information. See Section below called "Data Security" for more information on the steps we take to protect your Personal Information.

#### **What Personal Information We Collect**

We gather the following types of Personal Information in connection with your participation in FRN™ Dining and the provision of our services to you.

·       __ _Information you voluntarily provide to us._  When you register to participate in FRN™ Dining, you may provide us with Personal Information. We will also obtain Personal Information from Excentus when you are enrolled in FRN™ Dining by Excentus in connection with the Fuel Rewards Network™ program. This may include information such as your name, email and mailing address, other addresses (e.g. work, school), telephone number(s), payment card number(s) and expiration dates, loyalty program account numbers, username and password, the answer to a security question (in case you forget your password), special dates (e.g. birthday, anniversary), and dining preferences. You may also provide us with information regarding your personal accounts and/or profiles on third-party social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. You may provide us with Personal Information in connection with participating in contests, giveaways, sweepstakes, and other promotions, or in connection with completing surveys for us.

·       __ _Information we collect from your participation in FRN™ Dining or using our services._  We collect Personal Information from the payment network of your registered payment card, payment card processors and other entities that have access to payment card transaction information with respect to transactions that you pay for using your registered payment card at merchants that participate in the rewards programs that we operate. The merchants that participate in the rewards program we operate include merchants at which you may earn a benefit from FRN™ Dining and also merchants who are not available to you for earning a benefit but participate in other rewards programs that we operate. Benefits may not be available because (1) benefits are not offered on that day of the week or time of day, (2) benefits are not offered to members of FRN™ Dining, (3) benefits are not offered to you based on your member status or participation level in FRN™ Dining or (4) you otherwise do not qualify to receive a benefit at that merchant. This means that we may receive information about transactions that you make at merchants even though you are not aware that the merchant participates in a rewards program that we operate and even though you do not receive a benefit with respect to that transaction. The information that we receive regarding registered payment card transactions at merchants who participate in the rewards programs that we operate include the merchant you visited, the date of your visit, the amount of your bill and the payment card used to pay. In addition to transaction information, we also collect other information from your participation in FRN™ Dining or using our services, including information regarding visits to the websites that we operate, email confirmations when you open an email from us if your computer supports such capabilities, information about your location if you use the "current location" feature of our mobile smartphone application or mobile website and general usage information for our mobile smartphone application. We also collect information from your use of our customer services, such as information when you send us an inquiry, comment or request including any email or mailing address or telephone number you provide so that we may respond.

·       __ _Information obtained about you from others._  We may also collect Personal Information from merchants or other parties who do not participate in FRN™ Dining. For example, we may work with firms that provide us demographic information in order to evaluate or improve our services to you. We may collect transaction information from merchants who are considering joining our rewards programs in order to determine activity by members of the rewards programs that we operate at that merchant. We may also collect information with your consent or as required by law.

#### **Use of Personal Information**

We use Personal Information to operate our business and provide products and services to you.

#### **Retention and Disposal of Information**

We retain Personal Information as long as we determine is required for operation of our business and to meet legal, regulatory and other requirements. We take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is disposed of securely when we no longer require such data.

Personal Information is stored for the most part electronically in our computer systems or the computer systems of non-affiliated third parties that we work with in connection with operating our business, operating FRN™ Dining or providing services to you. We may have Personal Information on electronic and non-electronic media. The measures we take to protect Personal Information are described in the section below on "Data Security".

#### **Access to Information**

We restrict access to Personal Information to those individuals or entities that require access to that information in order for us to operate our business, operate, manage, and expand our products and services and provide products and services to you.

#### **What Personal Information We Disclose**

We may disclose Personal Information to non-affiliated third parties, such as suppliers, vendors or contractors, as necessary for the non-affiliated third party to provide services to us (such as printing or mailing services or otherwise) in connection with operating our business, operating, managing, and expanding our products and services, and providing products and services to you, such as our mobile smartphone application.

We also may disclose any Personal Information we collect with our affiliates, including for purposes such as for internal audit, management, billing or administrative purposes including protecting FRN™ Dining and its members from losses, and to protect our rights. We may also disclose Personal Information as necessary for defending and bringing legal actions.

We may disclose Personal Information if required by a government authority or legal process, which may include location data from your use of our mobile smartphone application.

We will not disclose your Personal Information (such as your email address) to non-affiliated third parties for such parties' use in marketing their goods or services without your consent.

We may obtain your consent to share information with non-affiliated third parties in various ways. For example, we may invite you to participate in a survey or special promotional program offered by a non-affiliated third party and your choice to participate in such a survey or promotional program will indicate your consent for us to share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties in connection with the survey or promotional program. If you consent to such disclosure, any information that you provide to the third parties will be controlled by that party's privacy policy, not our privacy policy.

You may also give us permission to use and post information about your restaurant visits, restaurant reviews, and other FRN™ Dining activities on FRN™ Dining's social networking accounts such as Facebook or Twitter or on your own social networking accounts. The posting and display of this information on third party networking site is subject to, and governed by, the privacy policy and privacy settings of the various social networking sites and services. Before providing consent to post any information to such third party social networking sites, users should understand the privacy policies and practices of the third party responsible for that website.

We do not control the privacy policies of such third parties and we assume no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties.

#### **Communicating With You**

We may from time to time send special offers to you on behalf of selected companies that we think may be of interest to you. However, because we or our third party vendors (and not the selected company) would send such offers to you, it is not necessary to disclose Personal Information to the company in order to send these offers to you. You may choose to opt out of certain of our marketing communications while still receiving other types of our marketing communications. We also may send you offers for goods or services sold by us or our affiliates, including in our email newsletters, by email or ordinary mail, or by telephone.
