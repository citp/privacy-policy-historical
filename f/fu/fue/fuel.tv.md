### 1\. INTRODUCTION

("Fuel TV" or "we") operates the website http://www.Fuel.tv which is an entertainment website featuring the lifestyle and culture of adrenaline and thrill-seeking sports and the stories that surround them (the "Site"). The services Fuel TV offers include the Site, newsletters and any other features, content, or applications offered from time to time by Fuel TV in connection with the Site, including when FuelTV.com is accessed via the Internet, mobile or other device (collectively, the "Fuel TV Services"). Fuel TV is part of the United States based operations of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

As set forth in our [Terms of Use](http://www.fuel.tv/tos), Fuel TV is a general audience site, is not targeted to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

The Policy describes the collection and use of users' personal information on the Fuel TV Services. It also describes generally Fuel TV's practices for handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user or user account. This Privacy Policy applies to all "users," including visitors (users who use some of the Fuel TV Services without being registered with Fuel TV) and "Subscribers" (users who have registered to receive one or more Fuel TV newsletter).

### 2\. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON FUEL TV SERVICES

_Fuel TV Collected Information_

**Fuel TV Site Activity Information.** When users access the Fuel TV Services, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Fuel TV Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Fuel TV Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device in order to serve content to it. We also may use cookies and other tracking technologies (including browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies), which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so Fuel TV can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. We may use these technologies to collect and store information about your usage of the Fuel TV Services, such as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, and advertisements you have seen. Fuel TV may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the Sites to personal information obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the Sites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. 

We also collect personal information in manual or off-line format, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing a detailed privacy notice in those situations is often impractical. In these situations, we will provide consumers with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Privacy Policy.

Third parties that support the Fuel TV Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing users to share content and post comments or tracking aggregate Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information. Fuel TV does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party ad networks that use these technologies, see [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).
