Security

To maximize security for our visitors, we employ a GeoTrust certificate recognized by Microsoft Internet Explorer (8+), Google Chrome (14+), Apple Safari (5+) and Mozilla Firefox (9+) browsers that use 128-bit encryption ("Compatible Web Browsers"). Older browsers will still create a secure SSL connection at 40, 56 or 128 bits depending on the precise browser version. Encryption is a means of scrambling information for transmissions, in this case, between your PC and our web-site. Information that is encrypted (Scrambled) at one end is decrypted (descrambled) upon receipt at the other end. 128-bit encryption is the strongest, most secure form of encryption that is generally available in Internet browsers today. 40-bit encryption is the basic minimum standard that is prevalent in most browser products. Compatible Web Browsers with 128-bit encryption can be downloaded by clicking on their respective icons.
