    <td><div align="justify">We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate 
        our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices 
        with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal 
        information provided by visitors to our Web site. By using this site, 
        you signify your assent to these our privacy practices and the terms and 
        conditions of our Web site. </div>
      <p align="justify">If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not 
        use this site.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>WHAT TYPE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"><strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong><br>
        We only collect personal information from visitors to our Web site when 
        they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration form 
        or electing to use one of our services. We may require visitors to provide 
        us with information including, but not limited to, their name, physical 
        address, email address, birth date, username and password. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong><em>Non-Personal Information</em></strong><br>
        When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information may 
        be collected from them including, but not limited to, their browser type 
        (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows 
        or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed 
        the site (e.g., lycos.com). In addition, we may collect information about 
        visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit the 
        Web site, the areas or pages of our Web site that they visit, the amount 
        of time spent viewing the site, the number of times the visitor returns 
        to the site, and click-stream data. We use transparent tracking pixels 
        to determine the number of Web site visitors that have been sent to us 
        through our affiliate network. We do not track any information about visitors 
        once they leave our site. We may use cookies (small text files that are 
        stored on visitors computers when they access our Web site) to collect 
        this information. Information collected through cookies may be combined 
        with visitors' personal information. We may also allow unaffiliated third 
        parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to visitors of our Web 
        site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they 
        may not be able to use certain features on our Web site. The "help" 
        segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a browser 
        to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform a user when 
        they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from their hard drives. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND DISCLAIMER</strong><br>
        <br>

age verification, marketing, promotional and  advertising use and for the transmission of email communications, the sending of

confidental by only in-house, for purposes of providing  such goods and services. NO PERSONAL INFORATION WILL BE SHARED 
WITH ANY THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT CUSTOMER'S PERMISSION</p>
      <p align="justify">By your acts of  signing up as a subscriber to the Site, accepting the Terms and Conditions of  the Site and affirmatively consenting to accept emails from this Site.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>“OPT-OUT” – REVOCATION OF CONSENT  PROCEDURE</strong><br>

        <strong>DISCLOSURE</strong><br>
        We will not disclose or use any of your personally identifiable  information except to the extent set forth in this Privacy Policy, or under  special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law  requires it, or when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information  is necessary to enforce any of our rights and terms and conditions or identify,  contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the <a href="terms.html" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>.<br>

        <strong>WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT 
        YOUR DATA?</strong><br>
        To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity, and ensure 
        the appropriate use of information, we have put in place certain physical, 
        electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information 
        we collect from visitors to our Web site. We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) 
        technology to protect any credit card information you provide us. We allow 
        access to personal information only to persons and entities engaging in 
        activities provided for by this Privacy Policy. Visitors should consider 
        any communication that they transmit to us (such as data, questions or 
        answers, comments, suggestions, or communications submitted to a chat 
        room) to be non-confidential. We will not be liable or responsible if 
        information that belongs to a visitor is intercepted and used by an unintended 
        recipient. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>WE PROTECT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong><br>
        Protecting the privacy of children is VERY important to us. For that reason 
        we do not structure any part of our site to attract anyone under the age 
        of 18 (21 in some areas) and we do not allow anyone under the age of 18 
        (21 in some areas) to register and become a member of our site. </p>

        are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit 
        this page to review the then-current terms and conditions to which you

        through our Web site (such as our advertisers) have different privacy 
        practices from those stated in this Privacy Policy, those third-party 
        privacy practices govern the collection and use of information you provide 
        when visiting those sites. We are not responsible for the policies, content, 
        and practices of other companies. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
