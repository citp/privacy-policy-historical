We may occasionally send you details of future events, news information about a range of our products, promotional links and other marketing communications regarding the services that we offer (including general customer support services). If you no longer wish to receive such promotional notifications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions given when you receive such messages.

Where you fail to reimburse us for any chargebacks, denial or reversal of deposits you make, we may, subject to applicable law, give details of your accounts and how you manage them to credit reference agencies or the equivalent of the same in the jurisdiction where you reside ( **“CRA** ”). Please note that the CRA may record the outstanding debt owed against your name and other personal details and this information may be supplied to other organisations. Such records will remain on the CRA file for 6 (six) years or such other period as made applicable after the date of the chargeback, denial or reversal of payment. The information will be used by the CRA to prevent crime, fraud, money laundering, verifying your identity if you, your partner, other members of your household, your business or financial associates apply for other credit facilities using your name or details, monitoring the operation of accounts you may hold, making decisions for credit, credit related or other facilities, trace your whereabouts, recover debts that you owe, statistical analysis and system testing.

We will only use your name in publicity materials with your consent.

The name you register with us to open a Stars Account must be your own name. In addition, it is very important that you complete the Stars Account registration form with valid and up to date information, since it will be used in the course of validating financial transactions and the other aforementioned purposes. You are required to advise us of any relevant changes to your personal information.

Users are able to change account details by selecting the relevant account option in the downloaded software.
