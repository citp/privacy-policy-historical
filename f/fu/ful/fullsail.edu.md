Commitment to your privacy

Full Sail, Inc. (also known as Full Sail, LLC and Full Sail University) (“Full Sail,” “we,” “us” or “our”), is committed to making your experience online satisfying and safe. Your privacy on the Internet is of utmost important to us.

We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information, including personally identifiable information, that we receive from users of our websites, fullsail.edu, fullsail.com, online.fullsail.edu, fullsailblog.com, alumni.fullsail.edu, employers.fullsail.edu, and hangr.fullsail.com (collectively, the “Sites”), through our applications for mobile devices (“Mobile Apps”), and through various offline information collection methods including without limitation the completion of lead forms sourced by third-party data aggregators. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Sites, the Mobile Apps or any of our offline information collection methods.

As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

Information Collection and Use

**Personally Identifiable Information.**

When you use the Sites and Mobile Apps, we may ask you to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that can be used to contact or identify you such as your name, home address, email address, telephone number or payment card number, social security number, and official, or government-issued, ID information. We collect Personally Identifiable Information for a variety of reasons. For example, certain features of the Sites and Mobile Apps require that you have a user account with a login and password: Full Sail students need a user account to access online courses; alums need a user account to access the online alumni network website; and shoppers may create a user account to order merchandise from Full Sail’s online store. Full Sail also collects information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These voluntary submissions include making an online request that Full Sail send you additional information about its programs, via email or regular mail, and submitting an application to Full Sail degree programs online. 

We also collect the other information that you provide as part of use of the Sites and Mobile Apps (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own), city and state, age and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”).

We use your Personally Identifiable Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to administer and provide the Sites and Mobile Apps and to administer your inquiries.

Certain Non-Identifying Information, which would be considered a part of your Personally Identifiable Information if it were combined with other identifiers such as your zip code and street address in a way that enables you to be identified, is considered to be Non-Identifying Information when it is taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information. We may combine your Personally Identifiable Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other users of the Sites and Mobile Apps to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Sites and Mobile Apps, and to analyze and understand how our Sites and Mobile Apps are used.

**Unsubscribe Information**

You may opt out of email communications from Full Sail University at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of every email. Requests are processed as they are received; however, some email communications are planned in advance and may continue to be sent for a few days following your unsubscribe request.

**Usage Tracking Information**

Full Sail collects aggregated information regarding user traffic patterns mainly by tallying page views throughout the Sites and Mobile Apps ("Usage Tracking Information"). Full Sail does break down overall Usage Tracking Information according to a user’s domain name, browser type, IP address and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user’s browser). Usage Tracking Information may also include the pages you were visiting before you came to our Sites or Mobile Apps, the time spent on those pages, search terms that you enter into our Search function, access times and dates, and other statistics. Nevertheless, we do not correlate Usage Tracking Information with data about individual users. We use Usage Tracking Information to determine which areas of our Sites and Mobile Apps that users visit based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build better Sites and Mobile Apps for you.

**Pixel Tags**

Full Sail works with multiple marketing partners to display retargeted ads to users of our Sites, on our behalf, across the Internet. They collect non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to our Sites and your interaction with our products and services. We collect non-Personally Identifiable Information through the use of pixel tags, “clear GIFs,” and javascript-based tracking means, which are industry standard technologies that most major websites use. We collect no Personally Identifiable Information during this process.

**Cookies**

We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself contains no Personally Identifiable Information although it will enable us to relate your use of the Sites to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only information a cookie can convey to us is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Full Sail uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad impressions and click rates.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the Sites. Nevertheless, there may be certain portions of the Sites that can only be used if cookies are turned on. For example, cookies are necessary for a user to access portions of the Sites that require a valid user account.

Phishing

Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Full Sail.  Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority.  We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your login information, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.  For more information about phishing, [visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website](https://www.ftc.gov/).

Full Sail Limits Information Shared with Third Parties

Full Sail does not share Personally Identifiable Information with third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve third-party advertisements on the Sites or Mobile Apps.

**Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.** We may share aggregated information that includes your Personally Identifiable Information, Non-Identifying Information and Usage Tracking Information with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.

**Service Providers.** We may engage certain trusted third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Sites and Mobile Apps on our behalf, to perform Site and Mobile Apps-related services (e.g., without limitation, hosting and maintenance services, customer relationship services, web analytics, payment processing and database storage and management services). Full Sail also shares information about prospective students with third-party services that Full Sail uses to evaluate potential applicants. We will share your Personally Identifiable Information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only if such third parties are obligated not to use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any other purpose.

**Affiliated Schools.** If you contact us to request information regarding our courses or degree programs, we may share your Personally Identifiable Information with our affiliated schools, the Los Angeles Film School, Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design, and Splash Media University. Our affiliated schools may use your Personally Identifiable Information to contact you to provide information regarding their courses and degree programs.

**Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.** Full Sail cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. Full Sail may disclose information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Full Sail or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

**Business Transfers.** Full Sail may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personally Identifiable Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

Security

We do not take measures to protect non-sensitive Personally Identifiable Information. Full Sail is very concerned with safeguarding your information.  The security of your Personally Identifiable Information is important to us.  But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). In some cases, we also encrypt sensitive information where it is stored on our systems. 

International Transfer

Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as where you live. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

Links to Other Sites

The Sites may include links to other websites maintained or controlled by third parties unrelated to Full Sail. If you click on such a link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information. We advise you to review the individual privacy policies of each external site that you use.

Our Policy Toward Children

The Sites and Mobile Apps are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [website@fullsail.com](mailto:website@fullsail.com). If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 and has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information without verifiable parental consent, we will delete such information from our files.

The effective date of this Privacy Policy is May 9, 2012.
