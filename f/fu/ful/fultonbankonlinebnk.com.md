Even if you opt out, we are allowed by law to share our experiences and transactions with you with our affiliates.

We may disclose personal information about you to certain nonaffiliated third parties that perform services or functions on our behalf, such as financial data processing companies that process and maintain your account records for us, or to our joint marketing partners, which are financial institutions with whom we have written agreements to jointly offer, endorse or sponsor a financial product or service, such as credit card companies, securities brokers/dealers and insurance agencies.

We may disclose the following personal information about you to those nonaffiliated third parties mentioned above:
