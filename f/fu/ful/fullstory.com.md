  * Provide assistance in navigation,
  * Provide assistance during the visit,
  * Analyze your use of our products, services, or applications,
  * Assist us with our promotional or marketing efforts.



When you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser in the form of cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences, or your device. It is used to make the Site work as you expect it to, and is designed to give you a more personalized web experience.

Because we respect your right to privacy, we provide you with a nice user interface you can use to opt out of our use of some types of cookies. In our Privacy Preference Centre, you can click on the different category headings to find out more and change our default cookie settings. However, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the services we are able to offer.

Here are the types of cookies we use:

Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.

You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.

##### B. Information collected for FullStory Customers

This section applies to Personal Information of FullStory Customers that we may process via provision of the FullStory Services. If you are not a Customer, please refer to either the FullStory Visitors or the FullStory Users section of this policy.

We use FullStory on FullStory. In this regard, we use a separate instance of the FullStory Services to monitor the instance of FullStory Services that our customers use. This includes using first-party cookies to maintain a coherent scope for a customer user session across the customer-facing FullStory Services. In addition, the customer-facing FullStory Services may use third-party cookies to aid in payment processing.

If you are a Customer of FullStory, when you signed up for the Services, you entered into an agreement with FullStory to accept FullStory’s terms of use for the Services, which includes the obligations in this Privacy Policy and our Acceptable Use Policy (the “Agreement”). As part of your use of the Services, we collect the same information as that of a Visitor (see above) through your interaction with the Site, and we may ask you for additional information, such as payment information, Usage Data in relation to the Services, and other information we deem relevant for the purpose of providing the Services.

FullStory may use Customers’ Personal Information as agreed to in the Agreement and:

  * To complete transactions between you and FullStory,
  * To send e-mail, chat, or in-app messaging about the Site or respond to inquiries,
  * To provide support for the FullStory Services,
  * To enhance or improve user experience, the Site, or FullStory Services,
  * In a support context, to view details of your account and ensure that it complies with your contractual obligations to us,
  * To perform any other function that we believe in good faith is necessary to protect the security or proper functioning of the FullStory website or the FullStory Services,
  * We may post your testimonials along with those of other satisfied customers on our Site, in addition to other endorsements.



The information we collect from Customers is disclosed only in accordance with the Agreement, this Privacy Policy, and the Acceptable Use Policy. FullStory’s [terms and conditions](https://www.fullstory.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/) prohibit Customers from providing FullStory with sensitive personal data through the Services.

##### C. Information collected when visiting websites that use FullStory Services

This section applies to Personal Information FullStory may process relating to Users of a FullStory Customer’s website.

For Users of a FullStory Customer, FullStory is acting as a service provider to the Customer for the FullStory Services. FullStory collects information on a User under the direction of its Customer, and has no direct relationship with the User whose information it processes. It is important to understand that when a User visits other websites that use the FullStory Services, the FullStory Customer’s privacy policy applies to that information collected instead of this Privacy Policy.

FullStory Services use first-party cookies and local storage to maintain a coherent scope for a user session across multiple pages on a single website.

FullStory Services do not and will not ever attempt to identify the same person across disparate, unrelated domains. FullStory takes pains in its engineering choices to differentiate itself from ad-tracking software. It is a violation of our Acceptable Use Policy for our customers to attempt to build multi-site user profiles for the intent of selling or exchanging lists of users or demographic information.

#### General Information on our use of Personal Information

We will never sell your data to third parties or otherwise share it with non-agent third parties. If this practice should change in the future we will update this policy to identify those parties and illustrate how individuals can exercise their right to opt out of such usage. However, in the course of business, we may hire third party individuals and organizations to help us make the FullStory Services better. These third parties include our web host provider, SaaS providers such as email hosting services, payment processors, or outside contractors we hire to perform marketing, maintenance, or assist us in securing our website. We may also hire third parties to operate, maintain, repair, or otherwise improve or preserve our website or its underlying files or systems.

FullStory may disclose Personal Information only to those of its employees and third-party organizations that (1) need to know such information in order to process it on FullStory’s behalf or to provide services as described above, and (2) have agreed not to disclose it to any other parties without FullStory’s consent. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Site and/or the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to such individuals and organizations in order to accomplish these purposes.

If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, FullStory may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with FullStory and our products. FullStory will only send you marketing communications, including via email, in compliance with applicable laws and in accordance with your preferences, that we believe may be of interest to you. FullStory takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of Personal Information. To the extent we send you this type of email in compliance with applicable laws and in accordance with your preferences, you can opt-out at any time by either following the opt-out instructions in the email or just replying to tell us you don’t want to receive any additional emails.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. If we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, User and Visitor information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.

#### Opting out of FullStory Services

If you wish to prevent all websites using the FullStory Services to be able to record activity, you can [opt-out](https://www.fullstory.com/optout) of the FullStory Services. Opting out will create a cookie that tells FullStory to turn off recording on any site which uses the FullStory Services. The presence of this cookie is required to continue opting out. That means if you clear your browser cookies, you will have to opt-out again. Unfortunately, this is the most permanent and least intrusive solution FullStory can offer because of how browser technology works. You may wish to employ a third party browser extension to block scripts like FullStory instead of using our Opt Out cookie, but know that using any third party extension may pose additional risk.

#### One More thing about FullStory Services

If you are considering opting-out, it's probably a good time to make sure you really understand that the purpose of the FullStory Services is to help well-intentioned companies make their website better for you. It is emphatically not one of those we-track-you-around-the-web kind of deals. We think that's creepy, too.

Most people who make websites are just like you: nice people who want to do a good job and make something awesome. And you wouldn't believe how much time and energy product teams spend trying to make their websites great for you. Without the FullStory Services, though, they simply do not have enough information to understand when they get it wrong. If they can see how you actually experience their website, like an ongoing usability study, they'll actually know what to improve! They don't need to record anything sensitive in order to do that, and we have a strict [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.fullstory.com/legal/acceptable-use) where you can see for yourself the high standards we expect of FullStory customers with respect to your privacy.

#### Blocking Cookies on the FullStory Services

If you choose, you can set your browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual cookies or all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser’s help file directions. Note that turning off cookies may also disable functions of many websites you visit. If your browser is set to reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, FullStory will not be able to coalesce your anonymous user identity automatically into sessions across pages on the same website.

#### Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes

We may access or release Personal Information about you when required to do so in order to comply with any applicable, laws, regulations, subpoenas, or enforceable governmental or public authority requests, including, to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also access or release Personal Information when we have a good faith belief that such access or release is reasonably necessary to (i) enforce applicable terms of service, including investigation of potential violations, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, (iii) respond to user support requests, or (iv) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, spam/malware prevention, and security forensics.

#### Security Measures
