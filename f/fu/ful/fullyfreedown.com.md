### **Privacy Statement for FullyFreeDown.com**

FullyFreeDown.com Limited (“www.FullyFreeDown.com”) owns or controls, and provides access to the FullyFreeDown.com website, currently located at http://www. FullyFreeDown.com (the “Website”).

### **Browser Information**

We collect data regarding the users of FullyFreeDown.com, including: (i) The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer. This may or may not be associated with a particular Internet Service Provider (ISP); (ii) The referring URL, if any; (iii) The browser software identification (i.e. the brand and version of your browser software).

### **Statistical Information**

We log certain information concerning the listening, skipping and music-sharing activities of users and other activities whilst they use the Website, and we may match such information with personally identifiable information concerning such users. For example, it is possible for us to know which records you listen to, which you skip, which you recommend to other users and which you add to your record collection. However, information related to your listening, skipping and music-sharing activities may be viewed by all other users in conjunction with your FullyFreeDown.com username and by third parties who have access to this information via FullyFreeDown.com’s API and webservices, as further explained in this Policy.

Please note that we do log and use statistical information in the aggregate. For example, we know the number of users who skip a particular song. From this information we are able to compile statistics in the form of percentages of all users (i.e. 29% of our users skipped song XYZ). We can of course compare the skipping statistics of one song to those of another song. We are also able to perform more sophisticated statistical operations based on the information collected. For example, we can determine the raw number (and associated percentages) of users who listen to one particular song that also listen to other particular songs. From this information, we are able to determine which songs are “neighbours” in terms of overall listener taste and we can see which genres of music tend to be neighbours. As a service, we may supply certain aggregate statistical information to record labels and artists that allow us to stream their music on FullyFreeDown.com in order to help them understand the likes and dislikes of music listeners.
