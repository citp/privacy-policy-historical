## Understanding Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

**Cookies and Click Stream Auditing:**

Cookies are small pieces of information that a website stores on a visitor's web browser.  Our affiliates do not store confidential or sensitive information in cookies.

Cookies are used within the online banking login process to identify a user's computer to better enhance security. If a cookie is not on the computer or the user changes computers, the user will be asked to re-authenticate. This process helps add an additional level of security for our customers.

Cookies cannot be used to capture your e-mail address, obtain data from your hard drive, or gain confidential or sensitive information about you. Additionally, cookies cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. Some websites, however, use cookies to obtain information from your browser. You can set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie, so that you can control whether you accept or reject a cookie. If you do not accept cookies, your experience at our Sites may be impacted.

Click stream auditing is the process of collecting and analyzing information such as a web user’s IP address, web pages which referred a web surfer to our website, date and time, domain type, and when a web surfer has responded to an advertisement.

**Pixel Tags and Advertising:**

We may also use a technology called pixel tags (also known as "clear gifs," "Web beacons" or "1-by-1gifs") on our Sites. These may be used in connection with certain pages of our Sites or with email messages to measure the effectiveness of our communications and our marketing campaigns, to compile statistics about usage and response rates, and to assist us in resolving issues that may arise on our sites.

We use third party advertising and media companies to serve ads on our behalf across the internet and to help manage and optimize our internet business and communications. These networks use both cookie and pixel tag technology to measure the effectiveness of ads for their clients, none of which contain Personal Information, during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide information about goods and services that may be of particular interest to you. We limit these networks from using the information collected by these cookies and pixel tags for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts. From time to time, we may also share Anonymous Information with such third party companies in an aggregate form, for purposes of analysis and improvement of our website. At no time is any personal information passed to these third parties.
