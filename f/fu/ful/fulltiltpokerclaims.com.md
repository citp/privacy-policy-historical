    PRIVACY NOTICE
    GCG PRIVACY NOTICE
 I. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
    The Garden City Group, Inc. (“GCG “) Policy Concerning Confidential Information
    and Comprehensive Written Information Security Policy is designed to prevent
    the unauthorized disclosure of non-public personally-identifiable information,
    including social security numbers and other non-public information that either
    may identify an individual or may be used together with other information to do
    so, in GCG’s possession (“PII”). GCG’s personnel are required to follow specific
    security procedures for storing, using, and disposing of PII provided to GCG.
    GCG may grant access to such PII only to individuals who reasonably need
    access to accomplish the purposes for which GCG collected the PII. GCG policy
    prohibits the unlawful disclosure of PII. GCG considers all such information to be
    Confidential Information that may be used only for the purposes for which it was
    provided to GCG, and may not be disclosed or disseminated unless there is a
    business need to do so.
II. POLICIES CONCERNING PII COLLECTED BY GCG
    Pursuant to court-ordered procedures, GCG, in its designated capacity as a
    settlement, claims or notice administrator, often collects PII through the return to
    GCG of proof of claim forms that GCG disseminates. Such proof of claim forms
    may be disseminated via the United States Postal Service, via the internet or on
    GCG’s proprietary website, located at http://www.gcginc.com (the “Site”), or
    through other websites that GCG may design and maintain in connection with an
    administration project. GCG also may collect PII directly through the Site without
    the use of a proof of claim form.
    The proof of claim forms that GCG disseminates, in whatever form they may
    take, may require persons or entities to furnish to GCG PII, such as birth dates,
    tax identification or social security numbers, and account information, only to the
    extent that such PII is deemed by the relevant court or client to be reasonably
    necessary for GCG to process, investigate or reasonably validate proofs of claim;
    for GCG to provide case administration services; or for GCG to comply with
    applicable laws, regulations or GCG policies and procedures. GCG’s clients and
    any courts that may be supervising the matter ultimately are responsible for
    determining whether it is reasonably necessary for GCG to collect certain types
    of claimant information in connection with GCG’s administration of any particular
    administration project.
    GCG’s clients or courts that may be supervising any particular settlement
    administered by GCG may determine that, to participate in that settlement, a
    person must submit a completed proof of claim form. In such settlements,
    claimants must provide the information, including any PII and any other
    confidential information, required on the proof of claim form or they may not
    participate.


A. Collection, Use and Disclosure of PII
   1. The PII GCG May Collect
      To participate in a settlement administered by GCG, a person or entity
      may be required to provide PII in order to access the Site and the
      information available through it, to receive notice of a particular matter or
      to participate in a settlement. To do so, a person may need to provide to
      GCG his or her name, email address, mailing address, phone number
      and other personal information. He or she may be asked in areas of the
      Site or on a particular proof of claim form for additional information that
      relates to particular settlements or other projects for which a court has
      authorized GCG to provide services. Depending on the circumstances of
      the project, a person or entity may be asked to provide financial or other
      PII that GCG needs in order to evaluate, process and pay his, her or its
      proof of claim. In certain settlements, the failure to provide the PII will
      prevent the person or entity from participation.
   2. Children’s Privacy
      GCG does not knowingly collect information from children under the age
      of 13 through the Site. If a person is under the age of 13, he or she is
      advised not to use the Site or to provide information to GCG. If GCG
      becomes aware that it has received PII from a child under the age of 13,
      GCG will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete that information
      from its database.
   3. How GCG May Use PII
      GCG will retain and use PII to accomplish the purposes, such as
      communicating with the person or entity who provided it or processing
      his, her or its proof of claim, for which such PII was provided to GCG,
      and shall retain such PII only so long as is necessary to accomplish such
      purposes subject to, as applicable in each case, orders of the court,
      contractual provisions concerning retention and destruction of
      documents, and the direction of GCG’s clients. GCG also may use that
      PII to customize the services GCG provides, and to comply with
      applicable laws, regulations and GCG policies. All hard copy and
      electronically stored PII shall be destroyed in compliance with court
      orders, contractual provisions with clients or directions from clients, as
      applicable. Such destruction shall be conducted in a manner that
      prevents loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access to the information.
   4. When GCG May Disclose PII
      When required to do so, GCG will disclose PII to the Internal Revenue
      Service (the “IRS”) in connection with Internal Revenue Code income
      reporting requirements. Except for such IRS reporting and the limited
      situations discussed in this Privacy Notice, GCG will not share PII with
      any persons or entities unless they are under contract with GCG to
      provide services in connection with the administration project for which
      the PII was provided to GCG, or unless the court supervising the
      administration project has authorized them to receive such PII. Thus,


       GCG may share PII as needed to fulfill requests to process proofs of
       claim or otherwise provide noticing and/or administration services. For
       example, GCG may be required to provide information to the court in
       which a case is pending, to the litigants in that case and to their counsel.
       GCG also reserves the right to disclose PII it acquired online if GCG
       believes, in good faith, that such disclosure is required by law or that
       such disclosure may be necessary to prevent misuse of the Site. For
       example, PII provided via the Site may be used by GCG to identify,
       contact and/or bring legal action against someone whose activities may
       threaten (either intentionally or unintentionally) to infringe upon the rights
       or property of GCG, of other visitors to the Site, or of anyone else.
       GCG does not rent, sell or otherwise disclose for any other purpose any
       PII.
B. Compiled Information
   1. Statistical Information
       From time to time, GCG may gather general non-personal statistical
       information, including information about the use of the Site, such as how
       many visitors visit a specific page, how long they remain on that page,
       and the hyperlinks, if any, on which they “click.” Through the use of
       technological features such as “IP addresses” and “cookies” (both of
       which are discussed in greater detail below), GCG may collect that kind
       of information to determine which areas of the Site are visited most
       frequently, and to enhance the Site for visitors. GCG also may compile
       that data in order to describe to our clients, the courts or others, or to
       respond to a government and/or legal requests, the use of the Site. Any
       such compiled data will not personally identify any person, including any
       visitor to the Site.
 2. IP Addresses
       An “IP address” is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer
       whenever it is used to surf the web. Web servers, computers that “serve
       up” web pages, automatically identify a computer by its IP address.
       GCG records IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to
       report statistical information and to track the use of the Site. When a
       visitor requests pages from the Site, GCG’s servers log the visitor’s IP
       address. It is not GCG’s usual practice to link IP addresses to any PII.
       Although a visitor’s session is logged, the visitor typically remains
       anonymous to GCG. GCG reserves the right to identify a visitor through
       an IP address, however, if GCG believes doing so is necessary to
       enforce compliance with the Site’s policies or to protect GCG, visitors to
       the Site or others.
C. Links to Other Sites
   Users of the Site are advised that they may be directed to other sites that
   are beyond GCG’s control. Links may take a person from the pages of the
   Site to unaffiliated sites. Those other sites may transmit their own “cookies”


          (pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive
          for record-keeping purposes) to visitors, collect data or solicit personal
          information. Visitors to the Site also are advised that the privacy policies of
          those other sites may differ significantly from the policies described in
          GCG’s Privacy Notice, and that GCG is not responsible for the privacy
          practices of those other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any
          personal information that may be collected there.
       D. Security
          Protecting the security of PII is very important to GCG. When such PII is
          transmitted to GCG, it is protected by a “firewall” (a combination of hardware
          and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing
          information within GCG’s computer network), as well as industry standard
          SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption.               Once GCG receives a
          transmission, GCG will take reasonable precautions to keep that information
          secure on its systems. While GCG strives to protect privacy, however, no
          data transmission over the Internet may be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
          GCG, therefore, cannot warrant or guarantee the security of any PII
          transmitted to GCG online, or be responsible for the theft, destruction, or
          inadvertent disclosure of that PII.
       E. Changes to This Notice
          The terms of this Privacy Notice may change from time to time. If a change
          is made, the “Last Modified” date located at the bottom of this Notice will be
          updated to reflect the amendment. Visitors to the Site are advised to check
          periodically for any changes. The continued use of the Site after GCG posts
          changes to this Privacy Notice will indicate acceptance of those changes.
       F. To Unsubscribe
          If a person does not wish to receive e-mails from GCG, he or she may
          unsubscribe by contacting GCG at unsubscribe@gcginc.com.
