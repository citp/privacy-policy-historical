# Online Poker at Full Tilt Poker - Legal Information: Privacy

## Privacy

**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our home page and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to the following Fulltiltpoker.com ("FTP") web site, but to make this notice easier to read we will use the term "our Web Site", which means Fulltiltpoker.com. Other FTP affiliate web sites may operate under their own privacy notices as provided at said sites.

Our Web Site contains links to other web sites operated by third parties. FTP is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of such third party web sites and this Notice does not apply to those web sites.

**Application of This Notice**

This Notice applies only to the information collected by FTP from the users of our Web Site. It does not apply to information collected by FTP in any other way, including offline.

**The Information We Collect**

Our Web Site is not set up to automatically collect personally identifiable information from each visitor to our Web Site. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our Web Site. This information is used only for internal purposes by our technical support staff.

Our Web Site does track certain information about the visits to our Web Site. For example, we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Web Site and its individual pages. These aggregated statistics are used internally to improve our Web Site and for product development and marketing purposes generally. Those aggregated statistics may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. For example, we request information from you when you:

  1. Log-on to certain areas of our Web Site, where you are prompted to provide us with your ID number and password as a condition to gaining access to certain information, materials or services.
  2. Register or sign-up to use a service.
  3. Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists for other products or services.
  4. Place an order.
  5. Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer.
  6. Provide feedback in an online survey.



In each of the instances above, we typically ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, address, product preference information, FTP ID number and password, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time.

**How We Use Information:**

FTP only uses your personal information for specific purposes. For example, you must be at least 18 years of age, or older than 18 years of age in those jurisdictions, territories, and locations where the minimum age for permissible use of the Web Site by you is greater than 18 years old. We use such information to verify age.

The personal information you provide to us when using our Web Site, such as your name, postal or e-mail address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with FTP, and to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from FTP, offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you, or used by FTP or third parties for the purpose of conducting market research or surveys on behalf of FTP. Agents or contractors of FTP who are given access to your personal information will be required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for FTP.

FTP may enhance or merge your information collected at its Web Site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you.

With respect to network advertising companies (companies that manage and provide advertising for numerous unrelated companies), to the extent that FTP utilizes such advertising companies to provide advertisements on our Web Site, FTP may provide them with your log-in name and any demographic information about you that we collect. Those advertising companies may combine that data with non-personally identifiable data collected by the advertising company from your computer solely for the purpose of delivering on our Web Site advertisements that are targeted to you.

Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to support your customer relationship with FTP, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information), or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.

You can opt out of receiving further marketing from FTP at any time.

We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only FTP (or agents or contractors working on behalf of FTP and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily opt out of receiving further marketing from FTP by emailing us at [unsubscribe@FullTiltPoker.com](mailto:unsubscribe@FullTiltPoker.com).

**Our Commitment to Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**
