If you want to submit any changes to this information, you may do so at the e-mail address above, although FullTilt cannot guarentee that such changes will be made and FullTilt assumes no responsibility for such changes.
													<br><br>
													<strong><font color="#336699">Collection of Personal Information from Site Visitor.</font></strong> FullTilt may collect and track: (a) User-Supplied Information - When you request more information from FullTilt through our online Demonstration Request Form, Seminar Sign-up Form, Contact Form or other forms on the Site, we may ask you to supply your name, e-mail address, and other personal information; (b) Server Log Information - When you visit an Internet Web site, certain information is disclosed to us about you, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the time of your visit, and the referring location (e.g., the Site or page that offered a link to a FullTilt page); (c) Statistical Data - In order to solve technical problems with the Site and to calculate overall usage statistics, we collect aggregate information on which pages you access; and (d) Cookies and Bugs - In order to offer and provide a customized, personal service, FullTilt may use cookies or bugs to store and help track your information. Internet "cookies" save data about individual visitors, such as your name, password, screen preferences, and the pages of a site you viewed. A Web bug is a file object, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel GIF, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user behavior. A Web bug can gather the following statistics, among others, the IP address of your computer, the time the Web bug was viewed, and the type of browser used. When you revisit the Site, FullTilt may recognize you using Internet cookies or Web bugs and customize your experience accordingly. You may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of your Web browser software, if available.
													<br><br>
													<strong><font color="#336699">Use of Personal Data Collected; Disclosure of Personal Data to Third Parties.</font></strong> Personally identifiable information collected by FullTilt may be used by FullTilt for many reasons, for example, for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users' activities on the Site, for product development, for content improvement, for fulfillment of or in connection with a requested transaction or recordkeeping, or to customize the content and layout of the Site. Aggregate data may be used for internal purposes or provided to third parties such as marketing firms. Additionally, individually identifying information in particular, such as names, postal and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information which visitors voluntarily provide to FullTilt may be (a) added to FullTilt's databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding Site updates, new products and services, and upcoming events, and (b) provided to third parties who provide products and services which FullTilt believes that visitors may be interested in purchasing or obtaining.
													<br><br>
													FullTilt will use its reasonable efforts to identify whether any third party that FullTilt shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal data for marketing purposes may have products or services of interest to visitors to FullTilt's Site. However, such parties are independent third parties over which FullTilt exercises no control, and, therefore, FullTilt is not responsible for their conduct, products, or services, and will not be liable therefor. FullTilt may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to protect the rights or property of FullTilt, in FullTilt's sole discretion. Personal data may also be disclosed or distributed to another party with which FullTilt enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as, for example, a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or asset purchase.
