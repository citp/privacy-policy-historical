# Privacy Notice

## School Loop Privacy Notice 

(last updated July 2012)

### Welcome

Welcome! School Loop, Inc. ("School Loop" or "us" or "we") welcomes you to our website at [www.schoolloop.com](http://www.schoolloop.com/) (the "School Loop Site"). 

We provide several services. Our website system is used to create publicly accessible web pages. School Loop Plus is a school-to-home communication and collaboration service that helps teachers, students, school staff, and parents share information about student home assignments, grades, and other school-related information. OnTrackEDU is a social dashboard system that helps education professionals support students and lead effective schools. We refer to our online applications and our website together as the "Service," and all the different types of people who have accounts on the service as "Users."

This Privacy Notice details important information regarding the use and disclosure of information submitted by Users to the Service, as well as information collected by the Service. This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the School Loop Terms of Service. Your use of the School Loop Site and the Service and any information you provide on the School Loop Site or to the Service remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Service.

**If we decide to change our privacy practices, we will post those changes on this page and in the "News" section of the Service. Please check this page for changes from time to time to make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.**

### Your Privacy

School Loop recognizes that School Loop Users value their privacy. School Loop understands that when a User chooses to submit information to the Service, that User trusts us to act in a responsible manner. We provide this Privacy Notice to help you better understand how we protect the information submitted to the Service and who has access to the information posted by you or about you on the Service. 

### Who Has Access to the Service?

School Loop Plus is the only service that includes parents and students as Users. One-to-one communication between adults and children is limited to school staff, and all communication is accessible by administrators. In addition, any adult who wishes to view a student's homework information must register with a valid ID number and have his or her membership reviewed by the affected student, who may challenge the registration.

School Loop Standard is designed for staff members and other adults that the School District gives web publishing rights. OnTrackEDU is designed for education professionals who have rights to student information as defined by FERPA (the Family Education Right Protection Act).

Students and parents can access posted content for their current or past courses if they are the targeted audience. Access to a student's grades by the student or the student's parents depends on the policy set by the school or school district. The Service allows a school's system administrator to program the access settings in the Service accordingly. Rights to this content can be restricted by district administration.

### What Information does the Service or the School Loop Site Collect? How do we Use It?

When feasible, School Loop automatically collects your IP address. We also automatically collect and store statistics and other information about you and your online activities in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis. This information helps school administrators assess and manage the School Loop system.

### When Will School Loop Disclose the Information it Collects to Outside Parties?

School Loop may store and disclose personal information as allowed or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (a) protect the rights, safety or property of users of the Service or the School Loop Site, the public, or School Loop or our web site suppliers; (b) conform to legal or regulatory requirements; (c) with the district's permission, to deliver additional subcontracted services run by third parties.

We do not otherwise disclose personal information collected by the Service to third parties. 

### How does School Loop Protect Personal Information?

We take reasonable steps to protect the data we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We do this by implementing industry-standard security procedures for storing and accessing information. However, you should be aware that we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Notice. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances; third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications; or users may abuse or misuse your information that they collect from our site. 

### What about "cookies"?

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are transferred to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies enable us to provide you with more personal service. Cookies also allow us to track usage patterns, trends and other aggregate visitor information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that if you would rather not store the information for future use. Please be aware, however, that if you choose not to store a cookie, you will need to login repeatedly, because cookies are what we use to manage your sessions. We may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the site and its services (such as browser type, operating system and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer). We do not match such information with any of your personal information without expressly informing you in each particular instance. 

### Third-party Sites

We may offer links to third party sites from our site. Please note that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any non-School Loop sites to which we may link. You should review the privacy policy of such sites before using the sites or providing any personal information.

### Business Transitions

In the event School Loop goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via a notice on our Web site for 30 days from any such change in ownership or control.

### Your Consent and Changes to this Privacy Policy

Please check this page for changes from time to time to make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.

### Update your Information or Preferences

You can access and update your contact information and preferences by going to the Account Management page on your home page and following the instructions on that page. However, to the extent that such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will immediately reach the other databases.

As School Loop is a product for schools and school districts, access to student login and password information is made available to school staff. This policy is in line with the rights and responsibilities afforded to schools under State and Federal statute. All material published on School Loop by students is considered public.
