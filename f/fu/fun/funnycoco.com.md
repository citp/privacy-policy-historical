# Best Fun & Most Creative Community - FUNNYCOCO.COM

## Your privacy is critically important to us. At FunnyCoCo we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.



## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, FunnyCoCo collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. FunnyCoCo’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how FunnyCoCo’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Funnycoco may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.  
Funnycoco also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Funnycoco does not use such information to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to FunnyCoCo’s websites choose to interact with FunnyCoco in ways that require FunnyCoco to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that FunnyCoco gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, FunnyCoco collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with FunnyCoco. FunnyCoco does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

## Aggregated Statistics

FunnyCoco may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, FunnyCoco may monitor the most images on it’s website.. However, FunnyCoco does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Funnycoco discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Funnycoco’s behalf or to provide services available at Funnycoco’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Funnycoco’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Funnycoco or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Funnycoco goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Funnycoco may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, Funnycoco will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Funnycoco discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Funnycoco believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Funnycoco, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Funnycoco website and have supplied your email address, Funnycoco may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Funnycoco and its products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Funnycoco takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.  
You should also be aware that if you submit information to “chat rooms,” “forums” or “message boards” such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.
