Privacy Policy was updated on 2015-10-29 07:52:34

### Effective: October 29, 2015

The following describes the Privacy Policy for _http://funnelkit.com_.

## Privacy Policy Scope

_http://funnelkit.com_ ("the Site") is owned and operated by _funnelKit GO_. _funnelKit GO_ is committed to protecting your personal information, being transparent about what information we collect, and giving you control over how we use it.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, **"personal information"** means information that identifies and can be used to contact a particular individual, and **"non-personal information"** means data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual.

The purpose of this privacy policy is to give you a clear explanation about how _funnelKit GO_ collects, uses and protects personal and non-personal information when you use our website and/or purchase our products or services, collectively called our "Services". It is important for you to read this policy in full to understand what information we hold about you, how we may use it and how you can access, update and delete your personal information. However, if you don't have time to read the whole policy now, here are the main reasons we collect different information about our users:

To help us monitor, analyze and improve our Services;

To obtain payment for product or service orders;

To fulfill product or service orders;

To provide you with a more personalized and valuable experience;

To send you details about our Services and other information we feel is of value to you, where you have signed up to receive such marketing communications;

To help sell online advertising space.

To be able to do these things, it's important we collect and analyze data including who our users are and how they use our Services.

## What Information Does _funnelKit GO_ Collect About Me?

We may collect information about you from a variety of sources, including information we collect from you directly; information we collect about you when you visit our sites, use our services, or view our online advertisements; and information we collect about you from other sources (where permitted by law).

### Information you provide directly:

We collect information directly from you when you choose to participate in our offers and programs or otherwise provide information directly to us. The following are examples of information we may collect directly from you:

### Information we collect when you visit our sites, use our services, or view our online advertisements:

We may use cookies, web beacons, personalized retargeting and other technologies to collect non-personal information about you when you visit our site, use our services, or view online advertisements. We use these technologies to provide you a more personalized and richer consumer experience at _http://funnelkit.com_. We do not store any of your personal information in cookies, web beacons or other technologies on your computer.

Third party vendors, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to a website. This lets companies provide you with targeted advertisements which are more relevant to you and your interests. Often called **"interest based advertising"** it is done by grouping together shared interests based upon previous web browsing activity.

The Site may use other tracking tools, including web beacons. Web beacons are images on the Site (or in emails that the Site sends to you) that help us determine what parts of the Site you have visited, whether you have opened an email that we have sent to you, or otherwise to measure the effectiveness of the Site. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information directly to us or to a service provider authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.

Personalized retargeting is another form of internet based advertising that enables our advertiser partners to show you ads based on your online browsing away from _http://funnelkit.com_. For example, if you visited the website of an online book store you may start seeing adverts from the same book store displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing when you come to _http://funnelkit.com_. This allows companies to advertise to people who previously visited their website.

Although these internet based advertising technologies can track your visits around the web they do not identify who you are personally. Even if you sign in to _http://funnelkit.com_ , the internet based advertising data is still not linked to your personal information.

The following are examples of information we may collect with these technologies:

Your browser type and operating system.

Web pages you view.

Links you click.

IP address.

Site you visited before coming to our site.

funnelKit GO emails you open and/or forward

funnelKit GO offers or links you connect to via emails.

### Information we collect from other sources:

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including social media sharing sites and commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases. The following are examples of information we may collect from other sources.

Name, postal address.

Age or date of birth.

Income level.

Marital status and number of children.

Your interests such as hobbies and pets.

Consumer and market research data.

Purchase behavior.

Publicly observed data or activities, such as blogs, videos, internet postings, user generated content, and in-store shopping behavior.

The data these sources hold about you has been collected from publicly available records, such as voter registration data, or via a range of sources with your permission (such as where you have agreed, through opt-in, for your information to be shared with third parties).

## How Can _funnelKit GO_ Use My Information?

_funnelKit GO_ may use the information we collect about you in the following ways:

## How May _funnelKit GO_ Share My Information?

We take very seriously our responsibility to maintain your privacy with respect to your information. Accordingly, we will only share that information under these circumstances:

with entities that provide services on our behalf, including website development, maintenance and support, payment processing, email distribution, and promotions management, only to the extent that these entities need the information to perform their services or as required by law, unless any additional use or sharing of the information is separately permitted under another provision of this Privacy Policy;

with identified entities whose products or services you specifically use or request to receive while you use the Site;

when we believe that doing so is required by law, may be necessary to protect any person's property, rights, or safety, or to investigate a potential violation of law

when to do so will help to enforce any terms of use or other legal agreement, or will help resolve disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business

in the event of a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger,

consolidation, or asset sale;

in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable form; or

in accordance with your consent.

## How Does funnelKit GO Protect My Information?

We will take reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.

However, you acknowledge that the transmission of information over the internet is inherently insecure, and no method of data transmission or storage can be guaranteed 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of any data you transmit to us via the internet or archive at this site.

However, doing so may also disable many of the features available through _http://funnelkit.com_ and therefore limit the full experience of engaging with our Service.

Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. These options are sometimes referred to as "Do Not Track" choices.

Because Do Not Track protocol is not yet finalized, this site's information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that it provides to consumers, will continue to operate as described in this policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.
