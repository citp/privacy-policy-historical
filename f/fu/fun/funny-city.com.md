When a contest/sweepstakes/survey is run on this site you may be asked to supply some personally identifying information like your name, email address and/or phone number.

Non-identifying information may be analyzed, aggregated and presented to third-parties to provide an overview of the demographics of our Network/s visitors.

**No Release of Information to Third Parties**

Personal information will not be released to third parties Our computer does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites. This information is used only for internal purposes by Smiles technical support staff. Our computer also recognizes the site where a visitor "clicked-to-check" on Smiles, but we cannot identify the visitor or the visitor's address. No personal information is collected. In addition, our web sites track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.

**Third Party Cookies**
