# Funtonia - cover ringtones for your cell phone

At Funtonia, we care about your privacy. We don't ask for any information that we don't need to supply you with ringtones, and we keep that information confidential.

We ask for your phone number so that we can send you SMS messages with links to ringtones.

We ask for your email address so that we can keep you informed about your account status.

We note your IP address because we are only licensed to supply ringtones in some regions. We use that IP address to check your location.

We also place cookies on your browser. They let us reward our affiliates and partners, and enable you to log in easily.

We do not store any payment information or any personal data, and we don't share any information that we collect with third parties.

If you have any questions please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20171211053040id_/http%3A//www.funtonia.com/contact.asp).
