reselling. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent<br>

that. Sometimes at FunBags we do use cookies during the purchase process, to have your own PC remember<br>

what kind of information was entered. We collect this information to better develop a sense of what services our<br>

customers need and not to track your individual usage patterns.<br>
