                <p>We may send new members a welcoming email or SMS to verify password and username. Established members will
                  occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. We present the
                  option to not receive these types of communications.</p>

                <p>We may send you service related announcements, including, for instance, when a Service is temporarily suspended
                  for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their

                </h3>

                <p>If you decide to send a "tell-a-friend" email to another person (when Funambol provides such a feature),
                  we will collect that person's email address in order to send the email. We will also collect your name,
                  email address, and any personal message you decide to include in the email, for the purpose of sending
                  the email with our systems. Unless we note that we may send reminder messages to that person, we will not
                  send additional emails to that person. In addition, we provide the option to opt-out of such messages as
                  provided in section 2.1 above.</p>

                <p>We may share your Personal Data with third parties in accordance with this Privacy Statement, only for the
                  purpose of Services provision.</p>

                <p>We may need to provide your Personal Data to third parties to deliver specific services to you (such as hosting
                  services or support services). These third parties are designated as Data Processors and are required not
                  to disclose your Personal Data and not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested
                  by Funambol. If a third party providing services on our behalf processes your Personal Data in a manner
                  that violates Privacy Shield or GDPR Principles, the third party is liable for damages unless it is proven
                  that Funambol is responsible for the event giving rise to the violation.</p>

                <p>You have control over synchronization of your Contacts Data and/or Rich Media Data through your account.
                  Our servers will synchronize your Contacts Data and/or Rich Media Data with other devices, and may synchronize
                  such data with third party applications, as instructed by you through your account. As noted in the Funambol
                  Terms of Use, it is your responsibility to maintain the secrecy of your password; if another person obtains
                  your password, that person may access and misuse your Contacts and/or Rich Media Data.</p>

                <p>Funambol may share some or all of your Personal Data with its affiliates, in which case we will require our
                  affiliates to honor this Privacy Statement. If our company or our assets are acquired by another company,
                  that company will possess the Personal Data collected by Funambol and it will assume the rights and obligations
                  regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>

                <p>We may share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our business partners but such information
                  is not linked to your Personal Data and is not included in your Contacts Data.</p>

                <p>Funambol may disclose Personal Data, including, without limitation to, Contacts Data and Rich Media Data
                  - if required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, if required by law, or, at its sole
                  discretion, if Funambol deems it necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the general public
                  or to prevent violation of the Terms of Use Agreement or the rights of Funambol or any third party. To
                  comply with Privacy Shield, Funambol may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful
                  requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
