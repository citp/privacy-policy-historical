### Security certificates

FundsIndia is an online financial services company. We fully recognise and understand the security implications of being a service provider with whom people trust their money. There are many safeguards we adopt in this regard – some of these are technical, and some are structural. 

### When it comes to data security, our goal is to ensure that:

  * Your data is stored safely and securely – passwords are one-way encrypted before being stored in the database for high security.
  * All communication with you, or with mutual fund companies and other service providers – are encrypted using the highest standards.
  * Your data is not shared with anyone, unless you have explicitly requested us to do so to fulfil a transaction request.

To ensure that we achieve these goals, we have a variety of certifications/trust verifications in place for our firm, both from technical and legal/operational perspectives. All our communications are encrypted by 256-bit encryption, and our data is hosted with top-tier hosting service providers. Also, our data is continuously backed up to ensure continuity of operations.

Here are some of our security certifications. These certifications are continuously updated by regularly auditing our technical infrastructure for full security compliance.
