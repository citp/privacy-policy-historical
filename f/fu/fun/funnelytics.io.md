# Privacy Policy – Funnelytics

### Last updated: February 25th, 2019

We value your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information of our users. We have adopted this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to be clear about the data we collect, why we collect it, whom we share it with, how you can access it, and correct it when necessary.

We have always safeguarded your Personal Information and recognize our duty to handle your data in a responsible manner. **We do not and will not sell your data to third parties**.

This Policy applies to the use of the[ https://funnelytics.io](https://funnelytics.io/) website, which includes the Funnelytics web application (the “Service”). Please read it carefully in order to understand when you may provide Personal information to us and how Funnelytics uses the Personal Information provided. By using our Service, you agree to the use of your personal information as described in this Policy. The terms “we”, “us” or “Funnelytics” are each intended as a reference to Funnelytics inc.

To make this Policy as clear as possible, we have determined the occasions when a customer would potentially share Personal Information with Funnelytics. The Policy is therefore divided as follows:

## Security

We use a variety of physical safeguards to make sure your data is adequately protected. For instance, when transferred to us and stored, your data is encrypted using 128-bit SSL.

Access to our database can only be done through a secure VPN. This allows us to create a secure connection to a separate network at all times.

We backup your data on a weekly basis on AWS S3. You may visit the AWS website to learn more about their security:[ https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/).

These backups can only be accessed by our Product team. Every member of this team has a different level of access based on the type of data that is needed for them to properly accomplish their work. No team member can access more than what it necessary.

As for your account information, you can only access your Funnelytics account through the use of an individual user login and password. If you have any questions regarding the security of your Personal Information, please contact us via the support chat or email us at privacy@funnelytics.io
