                  As a parent, you've probably done a lot of thinking about protecting 
                  your family's privacy on the Internet. We have been thinking 
                  and working hard to provide you with the best information and 
                  the highest quality interaction on the Internet in an environment 
                  that is safe. In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online

                  to keep kids safe: </span>

                      child during a registration process for a program or service 
                      of this site. Family Education Network only asks for a child's 
                      or teen's personal information if it is necessary to participate 
                      in the program or service. For example, use of the Learning 
                      Pod requires a parent or teacher to set up an account for 
                      their child or student by providing the child's first name, 
                      last initial, grade level, and school zip code. This information 
                      is used to track the child's progress through the activities 
                      and exercises in Learning Pod and is only accessible to 
                      the person who set up the account via a secure password. 
                      The site administrator also has access to the registration 
                      data, which is only used for site maintenance. Registration 
                      data that is provided about children is not used for marketing 
                      purposes and is never shared with any other party. If you 
                      would like to view your child's registration data, request 
                      a change, or request that we delete any of your child's 
                      personal information, please send an email to <a class="LNlink" href="mailto:customercare@fen.com">CustomerCare@fen.com</a> that 
                      includes your child's first and last name, school zip code,

                  industry; you'll find them used on Family Education Network,

                  <br>
                  <span class="black">An IP address is a number that is assigned 
                  automatically to your computer whenever you use the World Wide 
                  Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages 
                  -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. </span> 
                </p><p><span class="black">Family Education Network collects IP addresses 
                  for system administration; to report aggregate information to 
                  our advertisers, sponsors, and partners; and to audit the use 
                  of our site. When visitors request pages from Family Education Network sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We 
                  typically do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. 
                  This means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the 
                  visitor remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses 
                  to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce 
                  compliance with our rules or terms of service, or to protect 
                  our service, site, customers, or other individuals. </span>

                  such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along
