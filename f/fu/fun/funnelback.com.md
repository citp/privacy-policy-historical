# Privacy - Funnelback

Funnelback takes its responsibilities regarding privacy seriously and complies with all laws and regulations to the extent they apply in the jurisdictions in which Funnelback conducts business. A summary of the key elements of Funnelback's privacy policy is shown below. 

Funnelback is strongly committed to protecting your privacy when you use our services or interact with us. 

This Privacy Policy explains: 

  * when this Privacy Policy applies; 
  * what information we collect and why we collect it; 
  * our use of cookies to collect information and how you can control or delete these cookies; 
  * how we may disclose that information; 
  * how you can access and update the information we hold about you; 
  * how we protect your information. 


  1. ### Application of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected by Funnelback. 

  2. ### What personal information we collect and why we collect it

We collect personal information like your name, email address, telephone number and your organisation's name and location. 

We collect information about you because: 

    * you have provided it to us – for example, if you contact us to ask us questions or make comments or participate in a community forum; 
    * we need it to provide a product or service that you have requested – for example, if you receive support services from us; 
    * we would like to improve our services – for example, through the collection and analysis of statistical and research data and use of cookies; 
    * you register to attend a Funnelback event; 
    * you apply for a job with us; 
    * you work for us; or 
    * for purposes directly related to the above. 
  3. ### How we collect information

Broadly, there are two types of information or data we collect: 

    1. _Information that you specifically give us_

In some instances, you must provide personal information if you wish to receive a particular service or participate in an activity. 

You may choose to provide some personal information which is not required but is directly related to our functions and activities. This type of information will usually enable us to improve or broaden the services we offer you. If you choose not to provide this optional information, we would still be able to offer you the service although it may be with fewer options than if you had provided the optional information. 

If you provide us with unsolicited information that we do not require or which is not directly related to our functions or activities, we may be required to destroy or de-identify that information, provided it is lawful and reasonable to do so. 

In some instances, you will be asked to confirm that you agree to a particular activity such as expressly agreeing that you would like to receive our newsletter or other marketing communications. You can always opt out of receiving emails from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email or by visiting our [email subscription management page](http://engage.squiz.net/Unsubscribe-funnelback.html)). 

    2. _Automatic collection_
