<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction.</strong><br>
              
			  We take your right to privacy seriously and want you to feel comfortable 
              using our web site. This Privacy Policy deals with personally identifiable 
              information (referred to as "Data" below) that may be 
              collected by us on our site. This Policy does not apply to other 
              entities that we do not own or control or persons that are not our 
              employees, agents or within our control. Please take time to read 
              our <a href="/terms.php">Terms of Use.</a></p> 
			  
            <p><strong>1. Collection of Data.</strong><br>
              Our registration process requires you to provide personally identifiable 
              information. Providing us with other information is at your option. 
              Please take note that your user name, e-mail address, or other submissions 
              that you make on this site may contain your real name or other personally 
              identifiable information and, as a result, may appear on this site. 
              Like many web sites, we may also automatically receive general information 
              that is contained in our server log files such as your IP address 
              and cookie information. Information about how advertising may be 
              served on this site (if at all) is set forth below.</p> 
			  
            <p><strong>2. Use of Data.</strong><br>
              We may use Data to customize and improve your user experience on 
              this site. We will make efforts so that your Data will not be provided 
              to third parties unless <br>
              (i) provided for otherwise in this Privacy Policy; <br>
              (ii) we obtain your consent, such as when you choose to opt-in or 
              opt-out to the sharing of Data; <br>
              (iii) a service provided on our site requires the interaction with 
              or is provided by a third party, by way of example an Application 
              Service Provider; <br>
              (iv) pursuant to legal process or law enforcement; <br>
              (v) we find that your use of this site violates this Policy, 
              <a href="/terms.php">Terms of Use</a>, other usage guidelines or as deemed reasonably 
              necessary by us to protect our legal rights and/or property; <br>
              (vi) this site is purchased by a third party whereby that third 
              party will be able to use the Data in the same manner as we can 
              as set forth in this Policy. In the event you choose to use links 
              that appear on our site to visit other web sites, you are advised 
              to read the privacy policies that appear on those sites.</p> 
			  
            <p><strong>3. Cookies.</strong><br>
              Like many web sites, we set and use cookies to enhance your user 
              experience, such as retaining your personal settings. Advertisements 
              may appear on our web site and, if so, may set and access cookies 
              on your computer and is subject to the privacy policy of those parties 
              providing the advertisement. However, the companies serving the 
              advertising do not have access to our cookies. These companies usually 
              use non-personally identifiable or anonymous codes to obtain information 
              about your visits to our site.</p> 
			  
            <p><strong>4. Editing or Deleting Your Account Information.</strong><br>
              We provide you with the ability to edit the information in your 
              user account information that you provided to us in registration 
              by using your personal page configuration area. You may request 
              deletion of your user account by contacting our webmaster. Content 
              or other data that you may have provided to us and that is not contained 
              within your user account, such as posts that may appear within our 
              forums, may continue to remain on our site at our discretion even 
              though your user account is deleted. Please see our <a href="/terms.php">Terms of Use</a> 
              for more information.</p> 
			  
            <p><strong>5. Changes to this Privacy Policy.</strong><br>
              We may make changes to this Policy from time to time. We will notify 
              you of substantial changes to this Policy either by posting a prominent 
              announcement on our site and/or by sending a message to the e-mail 
              address you have provided to us that is contained within your user 
              settings.</p> 
			  
            <p><strong>6. NO GUARANTEES.</strong><br>
              While this Privacy Policy states our standards for maintenance of 
              Data and we will make efforts to meet them, we are not in a position 
              to guarantee these standards. There may be factors beyond our control 
              that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, we disclaim 
              any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure 
              of Data.</p> 
			  
            <p><strong>7. Contact Information.</strong><br>
              If you have any questions about this Policy or our web site, please
