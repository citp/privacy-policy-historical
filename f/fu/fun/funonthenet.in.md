FunOnTheNet has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: www.FunOnTheNet.in

 **Right to Change Policy**  
As FunOnTheNet is constantly innovating and enhancing the type of services it provides to its users, this Privacy Statement will also continue to change to match the services and features we make available. As such, we reserve the right to change this statement to match the services we provide. If we make any material change to this statement, we will change the date at the top of this statement to reflect the effective date of the change. When you visit our site or use our services and site features, we encourage you to check the date of this Privacy Statement to ensure you are aware of any updates. However, regardless of how this Privacy Statement may change or evolve over time, FunOnTheNet will not collect or maintain your private and personally identifiable information without your consent.

 **Password Encryption**  
Please note that registration in our message boards require that you specify a password for your use. This password is then encrypted by our forums automatically, which means that the staff of FunOnTheNet does not have access or knowledge of what your exact password is.
