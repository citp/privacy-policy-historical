</li></ul>
 <br> <br>
 
 
 
 
 <h4> 12. Use of Facebook Social Plugins</h4>
 <ul> <li>12.1.
Our Service uses social plugins ("plugins") provided by the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you live in the European Union, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Irland ("Facebook"). The plugins are usually identifiable by a Facebook logo (e.g. letter f on blue background or a thumb up icon). For a full list of all social Plugins please see <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" target="_blank">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>
</li><li>12.2.
When you visit a page of our Service that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser that embeds the latter into the Service, enabling Facebook to receive information about you having accessed the respective page of our Service. Thus, we have no influence on the data gathered by the plugin and inform you according to our state of knowledge: The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our Service. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking "Like”, or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. Even if you are not logged into Facebook, there is possibility that the plugins transmit your IP-address to Facebook.

 <h4> 13. Third-Party Content and Service Provider </h4>
 <ul> <li>13.1.
We are using third-party content and service providing services in order to embed their contents like quizzes, tests, games, texts, images or fonts within our Website (hereinafter jointly referred to as the "Content”). This always pre-supposes that the Third-party Provider uses the user’s IP address. This is because without the IP address, they cannot send the Content to the respective user’s browser. The IP address is thus required for displaying this Content. We endeavor only to use Content of which the respective Third-party Provider uses the IP address only for distributing the Content. Third-party Providers might also use Pixel-Tags (small invisible images, also known as "Web Beacons") to collect information for statistical or marketing purposes. Through the use of Pixel-Tags simple actions such as the visitor traffic to the Website can be pseudonymously recorded and collected, whereby user profiles may be created. The pseudonymous information might also be stored in cookies on your device, includes technical information like your Browser or OS, details of how you used our Service and interacted with Contents displayed by the Third-party Provider. This information might be combined with such data collected on other sources.
