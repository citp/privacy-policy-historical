# FundsXpress : Privacy Statement

  


FundsXpress Financial Network, Inc. ("FundsXpress") takes great pride in enabling its financial institution clients to provide secure online financial transactions. We enjoy a high level of trust and confidence from our clients and their customers, and we strive daily to justify and maintain that trust and confidence.

The employees of FundsXpress use the Internet everyday, and we too are sensitive to the privacy of our personal information. Since we are Internet users, like you, it’s only natural that we would assume that you might feel the same way about the privacy of your personal information. With that in mind, we have developed the following Privacy Policy to describe the type information that we collect on the Internet. This Policy also explains how FundsXpress uses and protects this information.

Our Privacy Policy is directed to FundsXpress financial institution clients and Website visitors. Section (1) describes our policy for visitors to the FundsXpress Website and Section (2) describes our policy for protecting the consumer information of our clients (the end-users of FundsXpress products). These policies are in addition to the extensive security measures that FundsXpress takes to protect end-user financial transactions on the Internet. Section (4) includes a discussion of these security measures.

**Visitors to the FundsXpress Website**

FundsXpress collects general information on its Website visitors simply for statistical and security purposes. Such information may include:

  * The Internet address (referral site) which brought you to our Website; 
  * The date and time you access our site; 
  * The name and version of your Web browser; 
  * The Internet service provider you used when you accessed our site; 
  * Your Internet Protocol (IP) address; and 
  * The pages visited in our Website. 

FundsXpress uses a cookie to collect this general information on all Website visitors. We may use this information in a consolidated, non-personally identifiable, format to assist us in offering the services and features that are of particular interest to our clients. We may also use this information to monitor the security and performance of our site. 

You may elect to provide us with more specific or personal information, such as when you give us feedback or send us an email requesting additional information from our sales department. If you provide personal information to us, it is only used internally and in furtherance of the purpose for which it was provided. Please note that all visitors and clients also have the option of contacting us by telephone.

FundsXpress provides a “Client Site” to provide additional information and support to our financial institution clients. For security purposes, this section of our Website requires authentication with an Access ID and Passcode. 

FundsXpress does not share or sell information collected from Website visitors. Also, FundsXpress will not send unsolicited email (spam) to our Website visitors.

FundsXpress reserves the right to monitor and make records of transactions and interchanges made over its networks, this includes failed log-on attempts in the "Client Site". You will not necessarily be told (unless the notification is required by law) that a transaction or interchange in which you are participating is being monitored or recorded. Monitoring and recording transactions or interchanges may be initiated, for example, if we suspect a possible breach in security or some other problem that would make it appropriate to monitor or maintain these records. We do not use this information for any improper purposes or distribute it to third parties, except as required or permitted by law.

**Financial Institution Customer Information (End-Users)**

As an Application Service Provider (ASP), non-public personal information of end-users may be housed or transmitted through our data center in order to provide our clients financial services such as: fxeBankingSM, fxBusiness BankingSM, fxLendingSM, fxPortanaSM, and fxFinance CenterSM.

End-users have high expectations for the confidentiality and privacy of their personal information. We recognize these expectations and strive to ensure that we protect the confidentiality of this information to the same extent that our client financial institutions must do.

The information provided below describes the practices that FundsXpress takes to safeguard the personal and confidential information of its end-users.

**Collection and Use of End-User Information**

FundsXpress only collects and maintains information on the end-users of FundXpress’ services in order to be responsive to user needs, provide contracted services to our clients, manage our lawful business, and maintain appropriate records. Generally speaking the information collected falls into two broad categories: (1) Information that is generated when a user contacts FundsXpress electronically, simply by virtue of the manner in which Internet communications are initiated and handled; and (2) Information that is expressly or incidentally created in connection with a transaction or providing a service. 

An example of the information collected under (1) may include the user’s IP address and referral Website, which would be logged when a consumer visits a financial institution Website hosted by FundsXpress or when a consumer or end-user visits the fx eBankingSM gateway page. An example of the information collected under (2) might include specific customer account information, such as an account number, account balance, access identification information, account statements, and/or bill payment activity.

FundsXpress may extract from and compile non-personally identifiable end-user information collected via (1) and/or (2) in a consolidated format for statistical and research purposes. Such information might detail the number of bill pay customers, the most typical payees, the number of registered users on fxPortanaSM and/or fxFinance CenterSM, and the time users most frequently use our services. With respect to former end-users we only retain this information as necessary to meet our legal obligations and record retention requirements.

Similar to our policy for Website visitors, FundsXpress reserves the right to collect and monitor all transactions on our networks and applications. End-users will not necessarily be told (unless the notification is required by law) that a transaction or interchange in which they are participating is being monitored or recorded. Monitoring and recording transactions or interchanges may be initiated, for example, if we suspected a possible breach in security or some other problem that would make it appropriate to monitor or maintain these records. FundsXpress also reserves the right to disclose such information to regulatory and governmental authorities if required.

**Third Party Disclosure**

FundsXpress understands that end users of FundsXpress products expect that their financial information and transactions will be handled in a confidential manner. We do not use confidential consumer information for any improper purposes or distribute it to third parties, except as required or permitted by law, or as necessary to provide a contracted service.

It is the policy of FundsXpress that non-public, personally identifiable consumer information may only be disclosed to third parties when:

  * The user, either directly or through our client financial institution, is believed to have requested or authorized the disclosure; 
  * It is necessary to administer the service or complete a transaction, such as bill pay; or
  * It is required or allowed by law (such as, but not limited to, responding to a subpoena or court order, reporting information to legal authorities, regulatory agencies, or other appropriate investigators in connection with a legal investigation or similar matter). 

  
FundsXpress contractually requires its third party service providers to protect the confidentiality of the non-public consumer information received from FundsXpress. Third party service providers are only permitted to use such information for the purpose for which it was provided, such as for bill payments. 

FundsXpress does provide marketing services and support to its clients in order to promote online financial products to end-users. We may provide aggregate and/or consolidated end-user information to our clients to assist in marketing financial institution products and services. This service is part of the financial services package that we offer each client. Our marketing efforts are coordinated with each client financial institution and because of this, our clients are aware of and involved with any joint marketing ventures. FundsXpress does not disclose any nonpublic, personally identifiable end-user information with any third party advertising firms.

**Security Features **

**End-User Security**

FundsXpress utilizes a comprehensive security strategy to protect user accounts and transactions conducted over the Internet. We use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology for all communications with the end-user. The communication is encrypted every time an end-user enters an access ID, passcode, or personal information during an online application or registration process. All financial transactions conducted by end-users are also SSL encrypted. FundsXpress servers use digital certificates to assure the end-user that they are actually talking to FundsXpress servers instead of someone pretending to be FundsXpress.

**Internal Security**

The architectural design of the system, the data center, policies, procedures, staff, hardware, and software selected for the FundsXpress systems are chosen with security in mind so that all transactions and customer information will be safe and secure. Internal security features include authentication software, encryption, VPN technologies, firewalls, anti-virus protection, network and host intrusion detection devices. 

The secure FundsXpress data center is designed to protect our equipment, software, and confidential information assets. FundsXpress has established policies and access controls which restrict employee access to sensitive and confidential information only as necessary for their job responsibilities. FundsXpress performs background checks on its employees and requires all employees to sign confidentiality agreements.

FundsXpress maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard customer information. Technology relating to Internet security is evolving rapidly, as are ways to circumvent security. Thus FundsXpress continually strives to stay abreast of developments in Internet security to thwart any potential threats to our security. 

FundsXpress clients are encouraged to contact the FundsXpress customer service department immediately if an unauthorized activity is suspected. It is the policy of FundsXpress to investigate all such matters promptly and report to the proper authorities. 

**A Word About Cookies**

A cookie is a very small text file sent by a Web server and stored in your computer’s or browser's memory so that it can be read back later. Cookies are a basic way for a server to identify the computer you happen to be using at the time, not you personally. Cookies are used for many things from personalizing start up pages to facilitating online purchases. Cookies do perform a very important function when you engage in secure Internet banking.

FundsXpress uses cookies in its products for security, statistics, and enhanced functionality. For example, with fxeBankingSM, we use an encrypted cookie to identify the end-user’s computer while they are logged on. This cookie enables us to process multiple transactions during the session without having to provide an access ID and passcode for each individual transaction. Users must accept this cookie to use fxeBankingSM. When the user logs off, or after ten minutes of inactivity, the cookie is no longer accepted and must be renewed by requiring the passcode to be reentered. A new cookie is used for each session. That way, no one can use the prior cookie to access the user’s account.

fxPortanaSM cookies are also used for security purposes and to collect general statistical information on all visitors. These cookies enable registered users to customize certain features, such as their stock portfolio and local weather. They also enable the user to bypass the login process each time they revisit. These cookies only contain a unique user identification number and do not contain or collect any personally identifiable information. 

When FundsXpress hosts financial institution Websites, we may also use a cookie to collect the same type of general information that we collect on this Website. This information is collected for security and statistical purposes.

We do not disclose any information collected through cookies with third parties. However, we may provide consolidated, non-personally identifiable information to our clients, such as the most frequently accessed pages within a Website or the most frequently used browsers.

**Links**

The FundsXpress Website may have links to other third party sites. These are offered as a courtesy and a convenience to our Website visitors and clients. FundsXpress assumes no responsibility for the content, reliability, safety, security, or privacy practices of any such site or any transactions with respect thereto. If you have questions or concerns about any other site’s policy regarding these matters, you should contact that site or its sponsor.

**Amendments and changes**

FundsXpress reserves the right to amend or change this policy at anytime. The most current version of this policy will always be posted on our Website. The effective date will always be clearly displayed. This policy is for our Internet audience and our clients and does not constitute a contract nor does it modify or amend any agreement we have with our clients. The examples provided within this policy are not exclusive.
