# Privacy Policy: Funology

We want you to have a good time at Funology.com, learn things, and be safe. We respect our visitors’ privacy. This is why we promise:

  * We will never publish last names, addresses, phone numbers, or any other information that identifies you. If you send this information to Funology as part of a message, we will delete it before we post the message on the site.
  * If you prefer that your messages not be posted on the site or published in any print materials–and you tell us so–we will honor your request. We will even delete those messages from our files. (Contact us by e-mail should you ever want us to delete a message.)
  * Our Web server automatically collects your domain name and keeps track of the pages that you access or visit. But this information is never connected with your name.
  * If you submit ideas or content to us, you admit that you are the owner of that content and are granting us permission to reproduce it on our website.
  * We may conduct surveys from time to time. We will share the information with our partners and sponsors, but only in aggregate form (for example, the number of boys or girls of a certain age who visit the site) and we will not identify anyone by their full name.
  * We do not request any credit card or other financial information. While we screen our partners carefully, we are not responsible for the content or safety and privacy practices at any sites linked from our pages.



Typically, you may visit our website without informing us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Some sections of our site may ask for personal information such as name, address and telephone number or e-mail address, and if you decline to give it to us we may be unable to fulfill your request. We collect only the information we need to respond to you or to process your online transaction. We do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share personal information collected on our website with third parties.

Our Web server automatically recognizes only your domain name but NOT your e-mail address. Aggregate information that we collect (e.g., total number of page views on a given day) is used for internal review of traffic patterns to our site. We collect your e-mail address if you communicate with us by e-mail or otherwise voluntarily provide your e-mail address to us, and we collect other information that you volunteer.

If you supply us with your e-mail address online, you may receive e-mail contact from us with information on updates to our website or about special programs or events in which you might be interested. If you prefer not to receive future emails, simply send an e-mail to inquiries (at) funology.com using “Please Remove this Email Address” as the subject heading.

We do not share personal information gathered via our website with other commercial entities. We may, however, share some aggregate information (number of “hits,” types of visitors, etc.) with our partner companies.

The website is intended for use by persons 18 years and older. This website does not knowingly collect any information about children under the age of thirteen.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.

The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and we disclaim all liability in connection therewith.

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.

After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

**How long we retain your data**

Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide while visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

**How to opt out of cookies and interest-based advertising.**

As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.

The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>, or <http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>and <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>, or [https://preferences-mgr.truste.com](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/).

To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
