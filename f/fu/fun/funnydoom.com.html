		<p>I’m just so sick of them getting special treatment by constantly using the race card and preying on the guilt of a few. They constantly cry about slavery and how everyones racist against them when they don’t get their way and its not just sickening but fraudulent. </p>
<p>Like it or not every race was enslaved at one time or another, but blacks are the only ones who use it to get special treatment. They always go on and on about how the Egyptians were black, well guess what? The Egyptians enslaved thousands of people. What about the black moors, they had slaves as well. Even in Africa today black people have black slaves. Thats why I’m completely surprised anyone would fall for their slavery guilt trip.</p>
<p>How about black peoples claim that the reason Africa is such a mess and underdeveloped is cause of colonialism. Well this is another excuse used to to try and mask their own failures. India was colonized by the British till 1947, Malaysia was colonized by the British till 1957, Hong Kong was ruled by the British till 1997. Yet since than all 3 countries have thriving economies, improved standard of living, and stable governments. What excuses do countries in Africa like Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda have? They were given their independence long time ago yet continue to fail economically and politically. And like slavery every country on earth was at one time or another conquered including America, Britain, Mexico, Australia, etc. But why why is Africa the only ones who can’t thrive and keep using these same excuses as a crutch. Why can every race have a successful country but black people. I don’t know 1 single country that has a population that is majority black that isn’t a dump or failure. I mean guess what the poorest and most lawless country in the western hemisphere is? If you guess Haiti, the only country with a majority black population in the western hemisphere than you are correct.</p>
<p>Also, why do we continue to give black people credit for inventions they never invented? Every black history month they try to feed people lies about the so called inventions that came from black people when in reality they were really created by others yet blacks try to claim them so that they can feel better about themselves. Heres the proof <a href="http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/" rel="nofollow">http://www33.brinkster.com/iiiii/inventions/</a></p>
<p>Its just so funny listening to them talk about how strong they are and how they over came so much when they are so weak that its funny. African countries receive more international aid than any other countries in the world. A higher percentage of black people rely on welfare than any other race. Most of the black people who were colonized and enslaved needed to be liberated from others, where as other races who were colonized and enslaved rose up and liberated themselves. I can go on and on, but I’m sure you get the point.</p>
<p>I just wish people would stop handing everything over to black people cause of guilt when in reality you have nothing to be guilty of. Let them actually try to succeed with out everyones help or leeching off other races.</p>
