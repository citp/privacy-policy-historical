			<p>
			Funnysiting has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy to our customers and users of this website. This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Funnysiting uses, maintains and discloses information collected from its customers and users of its website.
			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Children</b><br>
			Funnysiting does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 for marketing purposes. Funnysiting understands, however, that parents, guardians, or other adults often register our products for family use, including use by minors. Because some information is collected electronically, it may appear to be that of the registered Funnysiting customer, and will be treated as such by this privacy policy. If we learn that that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personal information to Funnysiting we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.

			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Information We Collect</b><br>
			Funnysiting may request or collect personal information from online users in a variety of ways, including through online forms for ordering products and services, and other instances where users are invited to volunteer such information.<br>
			The data we collect is information that identifies you personally, and may include:<br>
			•	Your name<br>
			•	Gender<br>
			•	Date of Birth<br>
			•	Country<br>
			You can remove or modify your personal information at any time by logging in to your account at Funnysiting and navigating to Options -&gt; Account -&gt; Account Data. To delete your account in its entirety, please navigate to Options -&gt; Account -&gt; Delete Account and follow the instructions under “Delete Account.” For more information on managing your account see the help section in your Funnysiting account.<br>
			Funnysiting may also collect information about how users access the website using a tracking ID unique to each user through the use of cookies.

			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>What are Cookies?</b><br>
			A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Your browser’s help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies. Session ID cookies may be used by Funnysiting to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website. They also help to minimize load times and save on server processing. Persistent cookies may be used by Funnysiting to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information. Cookies used on the Funnysiting website do not contain personally identifiable information.

			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Log Files</b><br>
			Like most standard websites, we use log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. However, none of the information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information

			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>How we use this information</b><br>
			Funnysiting may use the personally identifiable information collected by Funnysiting to contact customers regarding products and services offered by Funnysiting and, to the extent the user has agreed to it, by its trusted affiliates, independent contractors and business partners. We may also use this information for research purposes regarding the effectiveness of our website services, marketing, advertising and sales efforts. Except as outlined below, Funnysiting will not in any way share this information with a third party unless you specifically authorize such disclosures. Funnysiting does not sell or rent your contact information to third parties.

			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Disclosure of Information</b><br>
			Funnysiting may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to investors and potential partners. In such cases, only statistical information will be disclosed and personally identifiable data will be kept confidential. In case Funnysiting is sold, the information collected from users may be transferred to the new owners. Funnysiting may from time to time engage third parties, including its own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyze or otherwise store or manipulate data received by Funnysiting from its customers. In all such cases, third party service providers will be required to treat all such data with the same degree of care as Funnysiting and they will be prohibited from disclosing such data to any other person or party, except as otherwise provided for in this Privacy Policy. Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, Funnysiting may need to disclose personal information when required by law, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, subpoena or other legal process served on Funnysiting, in Funnysiting’s sole discretion. Funnysiting may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary.

			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Special Offers and Updates</b><br>
			Our customers and users will occasionally receive newsletters or emails with information on products, services, or special offers. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, Funnysiting gives them the opportunity to opt-out from receiving these types of communications. To opt out of all non-service related communications please follow the instructions included in the mailing you receive.

			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Service Announcements</b><br>
			On rare occasions, it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement, if, for instance, our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
			The Funnysiting website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Funnysiting is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. The Funnysiting Privacy Policy as described herein applies solely to information collected by Funnysiting

			</p>

			<p>
			<b>Maintenance of Information</b><br>
			The information provided to Funnysiting is saved indefinitely and may be stored on one or more databases directly or indirectly maintained by Funnysiting. Funnysiting employs industry-standard security measures to protect the confidentiality of the information. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur; we make every effort to prevent such occurrences.

			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Your Responsibility</b><br>
			You are responsible for the security of your Customer ID and passwords. Make sure you keep them in a safe place and do not share them with others. Always remember to log out after your session ends to ensure that others cannot access your private personal information. You should take this precaution even if you are not using a public computer, such as at a library or internet café, but even when using your private computer in your home.
