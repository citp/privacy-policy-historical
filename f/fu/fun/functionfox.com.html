	<br><br>
	Unless you choose not to receive promotional materials from FunctionFox, 
	we may notify you of special promotions, new products or services, or 
	other information that might be of interest to you.
	<br><br>
	We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we are

	security protocols are in place to prevent the loss, misuse, or alteration 
	of any information. We consider your information sensitive and private 
	and we are determined to handle it with the utmost care.
	Your data is transmitted via secure socket layer

	If you would like more information about our security procedures, see our
	<a href="security.html">Security page</a>.
	<br><br>
	If you authorize us to send you promotional materials, we may do so 
	using either the e-mail or the mailing addresses you provided on the 
	billing information screens. From time to time we may notify you of 
	special promotions, new products or services, or other information that 
	may interest you. We do not share any information you provide to us, 
	including your e-mail and mail addresses, with any companies outside

	<b><a name="prop">Does FunctionFox look at or share my proprietary data?</a></b>
	<br><br>
	No. FunctionFox does not view, analyze, share or otherwise access the 
	proprietary data entered by any of its customers.
	<br><br>
	No employee of FunctionFox is able to access customer information without
	the customer's express permission. Occasionally, a customer may allow access 
	to proprietary information in order to resolve a support or technical 
	difficulty.
	<br><br>
	Only customer service representatives and technicians 
	are able to access customer information once permission has been 
	received from the customer.
	<br><br>
	FunctionFox customer service is located off-site, on a different
	network than is used by all other FunctionFox employees. No other
	FunctionFox employee has access to the customer service network.
	<br><br>
	FunctionFox uses secure servers located off site, to which only our
	technicians have access.
	<br><br>
	Passwords are changed regularly to prevent unauthorized access by
	anyone to any information stored by FunctionFox for its customers.
	<br><br>
	Customers are encouraged to change their passwords and usernames on a
	regular basis.
	<br><br>
	The data storage facility has been designed to provide the highest level
	of security; protection against fire, flood and earthquake; and has full
	power backup.
	<br><br>
	Data is backed up on large servers continuously, and backed up to tape
	every 24 hours.

Each month I find additional ways to pull information reports for clients and senior management. When they ask for the impossible - I can always find a way to get the information with FunctionFox. This program has proven to be an invaluable tool in managing our department. Thanks for your support."<br><small>Marc Miller<br>Shell Automotive / Consumer Pr</small><br><br>"We're loving TimeFox and have just completed our first full year using it. The owners ran several reports and determined which clients aren't as profitable as they should be for us to continue working with them. They also determined that we were spending too much time on internal tasks that are not billable.
