We at **fuk.co.uk** are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998).

We will not email you in the future unless you have given us your consent by registering for the **fuk.co.uk** email newsletter or by opting in when entering a competition. If you no longer wish to receive newsletters, just email us and you will be removed from our database. 

We collect information in three ways: 1) Email addresses of everyone who opts to receive our monthly newsletters. 2) Visitors who opt to fill-in online surveys. 3) Competitions. Occasionally we allow a company supplying competition prizes to also receive the entries - in such cases we clearly state this on the competition entry form and always include an opt-out option.
