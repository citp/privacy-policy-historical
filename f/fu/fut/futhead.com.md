# Privacy Policy - Twitch

Welcome to the web site [www.twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/) , and any other web sites, applications, or services provided, owned, or operated by Twitch Interactive, Inc. (with its affiliates, " **Twitch** ") that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the " **Twitch Service** "). Twitch values the privacy of users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit and use the Twitch Service (collectively or individually, " **you** " or " **users** ") and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, and disclose information from and about you. 

There are many different ways you can use the Twitch Service ( _e.g._ , to view live broadcasts, upload content, communicate with others). Once you publish information publicly on the Twitch Service - such as when you broadcast content, participate in a chat room, post profile information, follow a channel, or subscribe to a broadcast channel – that information may be collected and used by others, so only share what you would want to be public. There are also ways in which you directly share information with Twitch; one example is by creating an account. 

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy in your Twitch account setup, or by using the Twitch Service, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Policy.

  * **Automatically Collected Information** : When you access the Twitch Service or open one of our emails, we may automatically record and store certain information about your system by using cookies and other types of technologies.

When you access the Twitch Service through social media networks or when you connect a Twitch Service to social media networks, you are authorizing Twitch to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also obtain information from third party services regarding your use of such services, including about your use of the content you choose to broadcast through the Twitch Service.

We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize them to use the information only for the purposes for which it is provided to them, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures. 

  * If you connect to a third party service (such as Facebook, Twitter, or another third-party application) through an icon or link on the Twitch Service or otherwise link your Twitch account with a third party service, we may share information (such as your user name, the fact that your connection originated from the Twitch Service, and other relevant usage and diagnostic information) with such third party.  With your consent, we may also send information about the content you watch or your activities on the Twitch Service to such third parties.

####  Advertisers and Analytics Providers 

We may use third-party Web analytics services on our site, such as those of Google Analytics and Mixpanel; These service providers use a variety of tracking technologies such as cookies to analyze how users use the Twitch Service; The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Twitch Service; To learn about opting out of Google Analytics, please; [click here. ](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) To opt out of Mixpanel, please [ click here. ](https://mixpanel.com/optout) Because these opt outs are cookie-based, please note that if you get a new computer or device, install or start using a new browser, or erase or alter your browser's cookie file, you may need to opt out again. 

Twitch may allow advertisers, third-party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the Twitch Service and other Twitch sites, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements, and to collect and track information such as demographic information, inferred interests, aggregated information, and activity to assist them in personalizing the advertising content delivered to you. Twitch does not provide information that personally identifies you to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Twitch to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of, those other advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see [http://www.aboutads.info/consumers ](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers) , and to opt-out of such ad networks' and services' advertising practices, go to the; [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out ](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/%29#completed) page, the [Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out ](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) page, or the [Your Online Choices ](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) page. Twitch does not control which companies participate in these opt-out programs or how these companies honor their opt-out choices. 

####  Do Not Track 

Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. 

####  Data Security 

Twitch uses a variety of managerial, technical, and physical measures to protect the integrity and security of your information. These measures may vary based on the sensitivity of your information. However, no security precautions or systems can be completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk. We cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

####  Children's Privacy 

IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TWITCH SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. 

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Twitch does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If Twitch learns that personal information of persons under 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Twitch Service, Twitch will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. 

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become a Twitch Service member, then please contact Twitch at [privacy@twitch.tv ](mailto:privacy@twitch.tv) to have that child's account terminated and personal information deleted.

#### Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy 

Twitch reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any time (for example to reflect updates to the Twitch Service or to reflect changes in the law). If Twitch changes this Privacy Policy, we will provide you notice of these changes, such as by sending an email, posting a notice on the Twitch Service, or updating the "Last Updated" date above.
