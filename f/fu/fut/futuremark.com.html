                <p>If you give us your consent, we will collect and store your personal information so that we can send you news, information and offers related to UL's products and services by email. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
                <p>If you choose to make your personal information public through our services, for example, through your choice of username or other account profile information, we determine that you have given us your consent to store and display such information. You can withdraw your consent by changing your username or by deleting your account.</p>
                <p>If you choose to enter a contest on or through our Services, we determine that you have given us your consent to process your data so that we may administer the contest. You can withdraw your consent by writing to <a href="mailto:UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@UL.com">UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@ul.com</a>.</p>
                <p>If you choose to complete a survey on or through our Services, we determine that you have given us your consent to process your data in line with this policy and the stated purpose of the survey. You can withdraw your consent by writing to <a href="mailto:UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@UL.com">UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@ul.com</a>.</p>
                <h3>Contract</h3>
                <p>In certain circumstances, we will need your personal data in order to deliver our Services to you or to respond to a request that you ask of us.</p>
                <p>We use Contract as the lawful basis for processing your personal data when you create a user account for our Services, when you request a quote, when you buy software or services from us, when you request customer support, or when you otherwise contact us with a request that requires a response.</p>
                <h3>Legal obligation</h3>
                <p>We may need to collect and use your data to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims. For example, tax laws require us to retain records of your purchases made through our Services.</p>
                <h3>Legitimate interests</h3>
                <p>This is a term in data protection law that means we have a good and fair reason to use your data in ways which do not hurt your interests, freedom, or rights.</p>
                <p>We may use your personal information including your identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse, to keep our Services secure, or to protect the rights, property or safety of UL, our employees, our users or the public.</p>
                <p>We use aggregated, anonymous data to analyze how users interact with our Services so that we can understand which elements are working well and which are not. This allows us to develop and improve the quality of our Services for all our users.</p>
                <hr class="mt40 mb20">
                <h2>Your rights</h2>
                <p>Users residing in certain countries, including the EU, have certain rights regarding their personal information. Except where an exception or exemption applies, these rights include the ability to access, correct, and request deletion of your personal information. While these rights are not required by law globally, all users of this this website and our software can manage their personal information as described below.</p>
                <p>We may ask you to verify your identity before we act on your request. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</p>
                <p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to protect the information in our Services from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, when you delete information from our Services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers, and we may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>
                <h3>How to exercise your rights</h3>
                <p>You can exercise your rights described below by writing to <a href="mailto:UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@UL.com">UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@ul.com</a>. If you wish to exercise your rights to your data across the whole of UL, you should submit a <a target="blank" href="https://app-de.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/e348820f-6ffc-48f0-aa9f-2d80a79304fc">Data Subject Access Request</a>.</p>
                <h3>Your right to be informed</h3>
                <p>This policy forms a key part of your right to be informed about the collection and processing of your data.</p>
                <h3>Your right of access</h3>
                <p>You have the right to ask for a copy of the personal data we hold about your as well as other supplementary information. We will reply to your request within 30 days.</p>
                <h3>Your right to data portability</h3>
                <p>You have the right to receive data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine readable format. You can also ask us to transmits this data directly to another data controller.</p>
                <h3>Your right to rectification</h3>
                <p>You have the right to correct information we hold about you that is wrong or incomplete. We will reply to your request within 30 days.</p>
                <h3>Your right to erasure</h3>
                <p>You have the right to have your personal data erased or deleted. This is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’.</p>
                <p>Please note that this right right does not apply when we are required to keep your data to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
                <p>You can delete your 3dmark.com account using the option on the Settings screen. <!--You can remove your email address from our mailing lists here.--> For other data that we hold about you, you can write to <a href="mailto:UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@UL.com">UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@ul.com</a> or you can submit a <a target="blank" href="https://app-de.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/e348820f-6ffc-48f0-aa9f-2d80a79304fc">Data Subject Access Request</a>.</p>
                <h3>Your right to restrict processing</h3>
                <p>As an alternative to erasure, you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. We will reply to your request within 30 days.</p>
                <h3>Your right to object</h3>
                <p>Where we process your information based on our legitimate interests explained above, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons.</p>
                <p>Where you have previously provided your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your information at any time. In certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn consent if we have a legal basis to do so or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.</p>
                <p>Should you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information, you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.</p>
                <h3>Your rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling</h3>
                <p>You can submit a <a target="blank" href="https://app-de.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/e348820f-6ffc-48f0-aa9f-2d80a79304fc">Data Subject Access Request</a> if you think that you have been legally or significantly affected as a result of automated decision making or profiling by us.</p>
                <hr class="mt40 mb20">
                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>We have security measures in place to protect against unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of the information we hold. When you enter sensitive information on our site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. We restrict access to personal information to a small number of UL employees.</p>
                <p>We are committed to safeguarding the security of user information that is retained on our servers. Nevertheless, determined individuals may uncover such information and disclose it. For this reason, we cannot guarantee against unauthorized access to the information we hold about you.</p>
                <h2>Retention</h2>
                <p>In most cases, we will keep your information as long as it is necessary to provide our Services to you or until you ask us to delete it, whichever comes first. User accounts on 3dmark.com are automatically deleted after five years of inactivity.</p>
                <p>We may also retain and use your information when it is required to comply with our legal obligations, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, protect our legal rights, or take other actions permitted by law.</p>
                <p>Information about you that is no longer necessary or relevant to provide our Services may be de-associated with your name and other identifiers and then aggregated with other non-personal data to produce insights and statistics that help us improve our Services.</p>
                <p>Aggregated, anonymized and pseudonymized information that we collect to improve our Services, protect the safety and security of our Services, or comply with legal obligations may be retained indefinitely.</p>
                <h2>Transfers</h2>
                <p>The Services are operated from Finland. If you are located outside of the European Union and choose to use our Services or provide information to us, you acknowledge and understand that your information will be transferred, processed and stored in the EU, as necessary to provide the Services and perform the Terms of Service. EU privacy laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The company providing the Services is owned by UL LLC, which operates from the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and choose to use the Services or provide information to us, you acknowledge and understand that your information may be transferred, processed and stored in the United States. United States privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.</p>
                <h2>Children</h2>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 and children under 13 are not permitted to register for an account or use our Services.</p>
                <p>If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@UL.com">UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@ul.com</a>. If we become aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete it.</p>
                <h2>Other UL Sites</h2>
                <p>Our Services are part of a larger network of sites and services operated by UL and its partners, the “Other Sites.” The Other Sites may have a similar look and feel as these Services, but they have their own terms and privacy policies.</p>
                <p>If you interact with the Other Sites, your information may be stored, processed, or shared outside of these Services. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit through the Other Sites.</p>
                <p>You can submit a <a target="blank" href="https://app-de.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/e348820f-6ffc-48f0-aa9f-2d80a79304fc">Data Subject Access Request</a> should you wish to exercise your rights to your data across all of UL's services.</p>
                <h2>Changes</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. When there are significant changes to this policy, we will give notice on the <a href="/">UL Benchmarks homepage</a>. If the changes affect the way we use your personally identifiable information, we will notify you where possible. If you object to any of the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should stop using the Services and delete your account.</p>
