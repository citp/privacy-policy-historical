## What we collect

The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us.

**Personal information**

Personal information is information that can identify an individual or information about an identifiable individual. We may collect personal information such as:

  * your contact information - e.g., name, postal address, telephone number, and email address;
  * your personal preferences - e.g., product wish lists, language preferences, and marketing consent 
  * your transaction information - e.g., products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, signature, and credit or debit card number.



In addition, we may collect the following types of information: 

  * we may ask you for your postal code, for example, to assist us with market research, planning our flyer distribution, and other marketing communications;
  * we may collect certain data when you visit our Web Sites, such as your IP address, the type of browser you are using or the referring URL; or
  * we may collect and summarize customer information in an aggregate format for internal statistical and research purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that a certain percentage of contest entrants are male, aged 18 to 25.



You may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you a Best Buy credit card if you have provided us with certain financial information.

**Supplementing Information**

From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information you have provided us. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide better service.

Our Web Sites or email communications may also use a technology such as "tracer tags" or “Web Beacons”. This technology allows us to understand which areas of our emails you click on and our behaviour on our Web Sites, such as which pages you visit. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our Web Site for you and other future visitors to our Web Site, and to help provide you with email content and ads tailored to your interests.

To learn more and to opt-out of having your information used by participating companies for online behavioural advertising purposes, please visit http://youradchoices.ca/choices. Please note that if you choose to opt-out you must opt-out of each web browser on each computer, mobile device and tablet you use.
