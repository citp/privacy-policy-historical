##### XII. Use by Children

A. FUTURE Policy. This Site is not geared to children under 13 years of age, and FUTURE does not seek to collect Personal Information about children under 13 years of age through its Site. If we discover that such information has been provided and collected through the Site, we will delete such information. Thus, we typically retain no identifiable information about kids.

This information will only be used to search our databases and deliver confirmation to you that the child's Personal Information has been deleted. Please note that the deletion of your child's Personal Information from FUTURE's database will prevent FUTURE from notifying you or your child in the event of a recall of a product your child purchased in violation of our policies. Therefore, if your child purchased products through the Site in spite of our efforts to prevent it, we recommend that you simply request the substitution of your name for your child's name in our records, in order to be notified in the event of a recall.
