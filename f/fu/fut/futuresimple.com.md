# Privacy Notice | Sell

### We're committed to the confidentiality and security of your personal information.

We’re committed to the confidentiality and security of your personal information. If you are the customer of one of our clients, you may not have heard of us. Still, there is nothing more important to us than our relationship with you. You may not know why we would have data about you in our system. We process data on behalf of companies with whom you have a relationship, with whom you have shared your data. In simple terms, you are a data subject, your service provider is a data controller (who determines how your data can be processed) and we act as a data processor. We’re committed to the confidentiality and security of any personal information that has been provided to us about you.

###### Who we are

Zendesk Sell (“The Service”) online services and the web site [https://getbase.com](https://getbase.com/) are provided by FutureSimple Inc. (“The Company”). We are based in San Francisco, CA, US.

###### What we do as a company

We are a provider of sales tools, customer relationship tools, and analytics that empower our clients to better serve their customers.

###### Who are our clients

We are a processor. Our tools and services are used by the companies that serve you. We work with companies of all sizes, in all industries around the world.

###### Why you may not have heard about us

Individuals do not use our services directly. Whether an employer, or a business working with other businesses as their customers, or a business working with consumers directly, companies need and gather information to better serve their clients. These companies use our platform to hold, analyze and get the most from the information they collect.

###### The type of data we process

Each client uses data differently. What is common to most is that they compile data that helps them better relate to you and provide services. Such information may include:

  * contact information and preferences
  * specific requirements you may have or interests you have expressed
  * preference as to how your service provided may contact you and how frequently
  * information you may have shared in conversations, emails, meetings
  * information about the type, frequency and volume of business you have done together
  * financials
  * location of data and demographics
  * competitive data
  * data that may be sensitive. Your service provider’s use of any such sensitive data requires your explicit consent



###### How we obtain data about you

We don’t typically collect information directly from individuals. Our clients gather information about their customers or employees and then upload that data onto our platform (either directly or by using the assistance of a third party) where they can benefit from the tools and services we provide. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule:

  * we collect information about our client representatives at sign up or login
  * we collect technical device information and addresses using cookies and similar technologies
  * we analyze and capture behaviors of individuals using our platform for analytics purposes only
  * we use the platform as an internal resource to manage employee and prospect data
  * we capture event data in logs, tracking systems and service tickets
  * we monitor and analyze access, traffic, performance and platform activity



###### Use of the Platform

Clients determine how they will use the platform for the processing of the data they collect. Each may differ in the services they elect to purchase and activate, whether there are customizations, and whether any analytic or third-party integrations will be used. Our client is bound by the terms of their own agreement with us and must also comply with all applicable laws in the proper and legitimate use of your data on Our platform.

###### What we do in conducting our business

  * conduct processing requests including analytics on behalf of our (data controller) clients
  * operate and develop our services;
  * send information, e.g. invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support messages
  * enhance client experience in the use of our services
  * inform clients and prospective clients about our other products or services (with their consent)
  * develop new products, integrations and services
  * distribute surveys
  * respond to comments and questions and provide customer service
  * protect against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activities



###### Our use of cookies

Some are necessary for the basic functionality of the site, while others help provide an optimal experience, or help improve our services. Cookies are a choice, and the types of cookies you permit can be set as a preference, and those you choose not to allow are easily disabled. Outside of the Services, third parties and advertisers may also introduce cookies to your browser for their own needs and purposes which we do not control.

  * If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.
  * As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We do this to protect data and systems, improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.



###### Ads and Third Parties

We partner with a third-party ad network to either display advertising on our web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.

  * Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other web sites.

These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

The Company will not sell personally identifiable information, rent it, or exchange it with any third party. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. The Company uses the information collected to service you, bill you and perform research regarding the usage of The Service.

However, if requested by law, The Company holds its right to share your information with the authorities; as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.
