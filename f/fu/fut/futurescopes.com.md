# Privacy policy | Futurescopes.com

Futurescopes.com is part of VMC Infotech, owned and run by Vikram Chandiramani. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and share personally identifiable information (information that can be used to identify you, such as your full name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number) ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals irrespective of their geographical location, both online and off-line.

Futurescopes.com is a website for general audiences and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.

This policy may be modified from time to time to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our information collection and use practices, the features of our websites, or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, those changes will be posted in this Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If we materially change our practices regarding use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change. 

COLLECTION: Collection of PII by VMC Infotech

We may obtain PII from third parties that we consider to be reputable. We also may receive on the VMC Infotech Sites user-generated content or information of any type or medium, which may include PII, including but not limited to: audio conversations; text chat and video images from chat rooms; user reviews; and article submissions.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information in public areas of an VMC Infotech Site, such as the member home pages and message boards, your information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We advise users to be especially careful in such public areas about disclosing PII, such as full name, home address, or phone number.

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer when you visit the VMC Infotech Sites. We may use cookies to recognize users who have already registered for a VMC Infotech website, allowing those users to speed up their future activities on the VMC Infotech Sites. Information about your activities on VMC Infotech sites and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to tailor the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests. 

Third party advertisements displayed on the VMC Infotech web Sites may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. VMC Infotech does not control these cookies. You should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the "Notice" section below for more information on third party advertisements.

VMC Infotech may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the VMC Infotech Sites to PII obtained from you or a third party. For example, if you've asked us to provide you with information about our products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on the VMC Infotech Sites may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.

You can set your computer to alert you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies, you may not have access to certain features on the VMC Infotech Sites.

We may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

We may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaVMC Infotechs. We prohibit Web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.

We may work with other companies that advertise on the VMC Infotech Sites to place Web beacons on their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on an VMC Infotech site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site.

Sometimes we collect PII from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.
