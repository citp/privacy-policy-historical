  * Type of browser, including your default browser;
  * Operating system your device uses;
  * Language preference;
  * The ways in which you use various features of the Browsing Product, your time of access and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Browsing Products;

The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“Personal Information”). The Personal information includes information which was either voluntarily submitted by you when and if you contact us (name, email address, etc.). To clarify, you can use the Product and services without providing us with any contact information. In addition, we collect you IP address through your use of the Product. Note that, while IP address is not considered personally identifiable information in many jurisdictions, there are jurisdictions (such as the EU), in which IP Address may be considered “Personal Information”. Therefore, we treat the user’s IP address as Personal Information, in accordance with applicable laws.

Nonetheless, if we combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.
