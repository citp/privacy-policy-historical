## Cookies and other technologies

When you visit Flourish, a web server sends a cookie or other similar technology to your computer or mobile device.

Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to Flourish, and will last for longer.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that and your help screen or manual will tell you how to do this. However, you will not be able to take full advantage of our website if you do so. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Although they do identify a user’s computer, cookies do not personally identify users and passwords and credit card information are not stored in cookies.

We use the following types of cookies:

  * Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website and under our terms with you. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into your User account.
  * Analytical/performance cookies. They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us for our legitimate purposes to improve the way our website works, for example, by making sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get and ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
  * Functionality cookies. These are used to recognize, to customize elements of the layout and/or content of pages for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).



Some of the cookies used by Flourish are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services on our behalf, as detailed below.

## Who has access to your information?

We will not sell or rent your information to third parties. We will not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.

We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to business partners, suppliers, sub-contractors for performance of the contract with you, and prospective purchasers of Flourish, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.

We may record Public Users’ screen sessions using the [Mouseflow](https://mouseflow.com/opt-out/) tool. This may include code, data and text that you have uploaded to the service but does not include other personally identifiable information. You can [view Mouseflow’s security policies](https://mouseflow.com/security/) and [choose to opt out of Mouseflow tracking](https://mouseflow.com/opt-out/).

We share your personal information with third parties who help us improve Flourish: processing transactions (Stripe, our payments processor), managing support requests (Helpscout and Olark, our customer support partners), and storing information on how you use the service (Pipedrive). We share the minimum amount of personal information required to perform these functions, and these third parties will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform these functions.

We may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of some or all of our business and assets to any third party or as part of any business restructuring or reorganization, or if we’re under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation or to enforce or apply our terms of use or to protect the rights, property or safety of our supporters and customers. However, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy.

## Public profiles, projects and templates

When you create an account on Flourish, this will generate a public user profile that will include: your username and name as supplied to Flourish; links to your publicly visible projects and templates; plus any additional information you choose to add to your profile.

For users on Public accounts, all your draft and published projects will be publicly visible on the web; for users on Public and Personal accounts, all templates that you upload will be available for use by all Users.

## Links to other websites

Flourish may contain links to other websites run by other organizations. This privacy policy applies only to our website‚ so we encourage you to read the privacy statements on the other websites you visit.

## Security

When you give us personal information, we take steps to ensure that it’s treated securely. Any sensitive information is encrypted.

While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 

Where we have given (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

## How do we store your information?

Except where otherwise expressly agreed, your personal information which we collect is sent to and stored on secure servers within the European Economic Area (EEA). This storage is necessary in order to process the information. 

Personal information submitted may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see “Who has access to your information”), which may be situated outside the EEA and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA. The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA.

Where personal data is transferred in relation to providing our services, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is subject to appropriate safeguards, such as relying on a recognized legal adequacy mechanism which may include entering into EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to transfers of personal information (see <http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/index_en.htm> ) and ensuring that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

By using Flourish, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.

## How long do we keep your information?

If you ask us to delete your account, any project or profile information, plus any templates created by you that are not being used by other users, will be deleted immediately. However, templates created by you that are already being used by other users may continue to be available to those users. 

If we delete your account for other reasons - such as a missed payment on a paid account - we will continue to store all projects, profile information and templates for a minimum period of 2 years after closure of an account, in order to allow the account to be reactivated without any data loss. We reserve the right to delete all templates, profile information and projects at the end of this period, or sooner on request from the company administrator who controls the account.
