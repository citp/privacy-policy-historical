    1. We may disclose your personal information to third parties where we are authorized (like payment partners) or required by law to do so, to government financial authorities, and in order to take action with respect to any suspected breach of the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/drive/terms.html) or any violation of law.
    2. If you supplied a European Union VAT ID it might be automatically transmitted to the EU VAT validator service for verification.
    3. We may disclose your personal information to affiliates or related entities for use by them for the purposes outlined above. We may also disclose to a third party in the event that we sell this business to that third party. 
    4. We may disclose your personal and other information to our employees and third parties who have been hired to perform services for us relating to the functionality and services of the Flowplayer website and associated sites / backend services. Any third party engaged by us is required to comply with the same obligations in relation to your personal information as we are under the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/drive/terms.html).

    6. We may disclose any information that is not personal information to third parties at our discretion.



## 4\. Cookies

  1. We use cookies and other technologies to enhance your user experience and monitor usage of the Flowplayer websites. Cookies are small text files downloaded to your computer to track movements within websites and store information like login credentials / session authorization data, or return urls when coming back from a third party site or a login process. For detailed information about this technology, please refer to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie). We may use both session and persistent cookies at our discretion.

Cookies can be used by web servers to identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning to a website.

  2. We do not link cookies to personal information, except for non-persistent site operation. We do not create personal tracking profiles.

  3. Most internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer storage, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored, depending on your browser settings. Please refer to your browser docs for detailed instructions. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the Flowplayer websites may not function properly.

  4. Third-party cookies

When navigating our site, you may also receive cookies from third-party sites like (but not limited to) moot.it (forum provider), Twitter, Facebook, Gravatar (forum user pictures), Paypal (payment processing), Chargify (payment processing) and others.




## 5\. Security

  1. We take all reasonable steps to protect your personal data against loss, abuse, disclosure any unauthorized access or modification. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted over the Internet, or of any personal information displayed on your account or in forum posts. 
  2. Your credit card details are not stored on our systems but transmitted to and (temporarily) retrieved from the secure servers of our partners Chargify, Quickpay and Euroline. Communication with those services is SSL-secured.
  3. We urge you to you take all necessary precautions to protect your personal information while you are online and to avoid disclosure or guessing of login credentials or similar leakage.



## 6\. Access and alteration

You may delete or alter your account information at any time. Note this might terminate services such as Flowplayer Drive, and create problems with license and purchase verification. We keep a backup of your information in case of an erroneous action; if you want us to permanently delete all your personal information you may request so through our support email. Note this will permanently and without a chance of recovery erase all your videos, licenses and purchases.

We care about the privacy and safety of your personal data and licenses. If you have forgotten your password you can retrieve it in a safe way from here. In case the email address to which your Flowplayer account is bound has become invalid as well, we have to ask you to provide us with a proof of purchase - PayPal transaction or receipt ID, Chargify notification or invoice etc - before we can grant you access to your account again.

**Note** : In your own interest we cannot divulge personal account information on email request. Sender addresses may be forged, and complying with such a request would result in a breach of confidentiality.

Please assist us in keeping our records accurate by advising us of any changes to, or errors in, your personal information.
