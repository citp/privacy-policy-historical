In addition, if you submit data to us about other individuals (such as your message and gift recipients), you agree that you have obtained consent from each such individual to the submission, transfer and processing of the information. Although personal information collected by us through the Web Site, emails, and telephone is used by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy, laws generally applicable to the protection of personal data in India may not be as stringent as those in other countries.
