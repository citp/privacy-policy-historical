Do We Share the Information We Receive?

Yes, we do share information but only as described below. Otherwise we will not provide your personal information without your consent.

  * **Advertisers:** We will share demographic, Internet traffic and usage data, and profile information with our advertisers, marketing and advertising consultants, and other business partners. This information may be used to present you with more relevant and customized advertising, content, and services. To the extent we provide this information to third parties such as advertisers, it is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
  * **Business Partners:** We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary or useful for the third party to provide these services.
  * **Agents:** We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data. These persons have access to personal information needed to perform their functions. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information that you provide to weHow for any secondary purposes.
  * **Service Providers:** We engage other companies and individuals to perform enhanced services on our behalf. For example, we might engage a third party vendor to provide electronic mail services. In addition, certain of our enhanced services require that we contact Internet directories and various search engines on your behalf. Many of our service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
  * **Business Transfer:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if we, or all or substantially all of our assets were ever to be acquired, including pursuant to a liquidation or other insolvency proceeding, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. In the event of a transfer of data in connection with a business transfer, your data will continue to be subject to this privacy policy or one no less protective of your rights than this one.

How Secure Is Information About Me?

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer or other internet access device. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Your e-mails to us are not necessarily secure against interception so do not include sensitive information in them - we generally will not ask for passwords or the like in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent.

You agree not to use or access our Website if you (or anyone else whose information you enter) desire a higher level of security than we describe in this Privacy Policy or if you have not obtained any appropriate consents.

We do not guarantee security. Neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems, and people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. You assume the risk of any inadequacy or failure of security and agree to do what you reasonably can to promote security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty (if any), you agree that the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty will be one of intentional misconduct.

What Information Can I Access?

We give you access to certain information about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. To view or change this information, log-in to your account. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our sites or supply information to our advertisers or promotional partners and to read the privacy statements of each and every website, promotional partner, or advertiser that collects personally identifiable information. If you are asked to enter personal information by a promotional partner or advertiser on our Website, it will be clear that the information is being requested by a third party and not by us. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by us on flowgo.com.
