### 6\. Cookies

When You interact with the Site, we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When You come to our Site, our Web server sends a cookie to Your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously.

Standing alone, cookies do not identify You personally. They merely recognize Your browser. Unless You choose to identify Yourself to CA Technologies, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering for a trial account, You remain anonymous to CA Technologies. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They are deleted from Your computer when You close Your browser software or turn off Your computer. Persistent cookies remain on Your computer after You've closed Your browser or turned off Your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for Your browser.

CA Technologies uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Site and Services to uniquely identify You while You are logged in. This information allows CA Technologies to process Your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure You are who You say You are after You've logged in and are required in order to use the Service. CA Technologies uses persistent cookies, that only CA Technologies can read and use, to identify that You are a CA Technologies customer or prior CA Technologies Site visitor (whatever the case may be). We do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. Users who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site but will not be able to successfully use our Service.

### 7\. Third-Party Sites

The Site contains links to other web sites. CA Technologies is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other web sites. Customers and visitors will need to check the policy statement of these other web sites to understand their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. It is Your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.

### 8\. Security

Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is accessed using a supported browser, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data are safe, secure, and available only to You. CA Technologies also implements a security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a server environment designed to be secure that uses a firewall and other technology designed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, CA Technologies provides unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Data.

CA Technologies may use third party vendors to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to provide the Service. When You use certain CA Technologies Services, Your Data are retained on our third-party data center's servers.
