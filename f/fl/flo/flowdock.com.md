# Flowdock | Privacy Policy

Flowdock was built to make it easy to communicate and collaborate with your team. Your privacy and security are important to us. You can choose what to say and share with your members in flows, but we want you to know that no one outside of your team will be able to access that private and sensitive information.

Rally Software Development Corp. ("Rally") operates the website flowdock.com. It is Rally's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information you share or we may collect while operating our website. This document explains how we will use the information that you provide to us via the service.

Rally uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research.

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of other terms of the service, or as otherwise required by law.

### Security

Rally takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Access to the production environment is restricted to only authorized personnel. Even though the software has automated tests for every feature, for any problems concerning payments or billing, a warning email is sent to our administrators to quickly track down all the possible concerns. Especially payment-related data is automatically verified before any action is taken. Our fault-tolerant server environment is situated in a commercial, physically protected data center. All traffic is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or other encrypted tunnels.
