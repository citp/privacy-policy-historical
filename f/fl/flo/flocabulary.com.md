# Flocabulary's Privacy Policy

| 

###  How do you ensure the security and privacy of my transaction?

At Flocabulary, the privacy and security of your personal information is paramount to our success as a company. When making purchases on our website, know that all personal information is collected and stored in a highly secure manner using encryption and secure servers. 

###  Is it safe to use my credit card online?

Yes. Our shopping cart is powered by Yahoo.com, one of the most trusted names in online shopping. Yahoo’s servers are completely secure, and all of your information is fully encrypted. When on a secure page, you will see that the “http” has been replaced with “https.” This indicates that your information is being encrypted and stored securely. 

###  Why should I order online?

Online orders are processed and shipped much faster than orders placed over the phone. Online orders ship out three times per week; phone orders ship weekly. Online orders also provide you with an electronic receipt, the ability to view your order’s shipment status and, where applicable, tracking information. 

###  What is your return policy?

Flocabulary products in resalable condition and accompanied by the original invoice may be returned within 30 days of purchase for a refund or exchange. 

### Do you share my information with other companies?

No. We will never share your information with anyone. 

###  I still have a Question!
