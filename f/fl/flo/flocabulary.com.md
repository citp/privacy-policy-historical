# Security & Privacy Policy - Flocabulary

##### 1\. Flocabulary's Commitment to Privacy

We take your privacy and the privacy of your students very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy and contact us if you have any questions. 

###### Our commitment is guided by a few major principles:

**We Empower Schools to Make Data Decisions**

  * Schools can use Flocabulary without sharing any personal information from students. Or they can choose to set up student accounts and use Flocabulary to track their students' progress.
  * The school’s account manager can delete or correct personal information from students at any time.



**Flocabulary is Committed to Maintaining a Safe and Compliant Platform**

  * We will only share the personally identifiable data of students in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  * We use industry standard security practices, such as SSL encryption.
  * We use aggregated, anonymized and de-identified data to inform improvements to Flocabulary.
  * We've signed the Pledge to Safeguard Student Privacy. Learn more here: <http://studentprivacypledge.org/?page_id=45>



**This Privacy Policy explains the details of how we safeguard and use the information you give us. By using this site, you agree to our Privacy Policy.**

##### 2\. Children's Use of Flocabulary

Only schools and districts that have purchased school-wide subscriptions, provided consent on behalf of students and opted to allow for student account creation can create student accounts. For all other types of subscriptions and trials, Flocabulary does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

If you are a child under the age of 13, you must get permission from a parent or legal guardian to use this website. If you wish to sign up for a free trial or subscribe to Flocabulary, a parent or legal guardian must submit the form on your behalf. 

If we learn we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 without the appropriate parent or school consent, we will take the necessary steps to delete it.

##### 3\. What Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?

**a. From teachers and administrators**  
If you are a teacher or administrator signing up for an account on our website, we collect your first and last name, email address, role at your school, grade interests and subject interests. We'll ask you to enter the zipcode of your school to select your school, and we remember the school you select so that we can properly give you access if your school has purchased. Additionally, we ask you to set a password to keep your account secure. 

Your email address will be your username. We'll use your email address, as well as your school, role, grade and subject interests, to customize the updates you get about Flocabulary via email. You can always opt out of emails from us by clicking "unsubscribe." If you are requesting a quote or schoolwide trial, we will also ask for your phone number and job title so that a member of the Flocabulary team can get in touch with you to set up your trial or help you with a purchase.

If you are purchasing a paid account, we will collect all information necessary to process the order, including credit card information, billing information or shipping information (as applicable).

Teachers and administrators with schoolwide accounts can invite other staff members at the school to create a Flocabulary account. To do this, they can enter an email address of the people they wish to invite. We only use these email addresses to send invitations, and will not send any other emails to these addresses.

**b. From students**  
Unless a school has purchased a schoolwide license, provided consent on behalf of students and chosen to allow for student account creation, we collect no personally identifiable information from students (other than parent or teacher selected usernames for certain legacy accounts). In cases where a school or district purchases Flocabulary and opts to enable student accounts, the first step is for teachers to create classes. Students can only sign up for Flocabulary if their teacher creates a class and instructs them to create an account with a class code. Students cannot sign up and create a Flocabulary account unaffiliated with a class or a schoolwide license. 

When students create a student account on Flocabulary, they'll enter a class code which will associate them with their school and teacher. They cannot create their account without a valid class code. We'll then collect the student's first and last name, and the student will set a username and password. We collect the first and last name so that teachers can identify students on their class roster in the My Classes section of Flocabulary.com and administrators can identify students in the school management section. We collect the username so students can easily log in, as well as have unique identification for the website. Because the first and last name are for teachers' class management, they can instruct students to enter an initial or nickname instead of a first or last name, or another form of identification, if they'd prefer. The student’s username and first and last name will not be shared with any Flocabulary users other than their teacher(s) and the account manager(s) at their school or district.

When students create student accounts, teachers will be able to assign multiple choice quizzes to students in their classes. Students' quiz results will be stored so that the student who took the quiz and the teacher who assigned the quiz can review the results. Students will be able to review the results of their quizzes at any time. A teacher will only be able to see the results of student quizzes from their classes. School subscription managers may also be able to review results individually or in aggregate across a schoolwide subscription.

Certain legacy Flocabulary schoolwide accounts and individual accounts may also include shared student usernames. These usernames are linked to information we collect about students’ usage of the Flocabulary site, such as units visited and videos viewed.

Flocabulary will promptly correct or delete student information at the request of an authorized representative of the student’s school or district.

**c. Information we collect automatically**  
In addition to the information you share with us through forms on Flocabulary.com, when you visit our website, we may automatically collect and analyze information regarding your use of our services and activity on our website.

##### 5\. How Flocabulary Protects and Secures Your Information

Each Flocabulary account is protected with a password. Make sure that you and any students associated with your account keep these passwords a secret at all times to prevent unauthorized access to your account. You are responsible for any activity that occurs while you or any students associated with your account are logged in to Flocabulary, whether or not that access is authorized by you. If you think that someone has gained unauthorized access to your account, please contact us immediately.

We have industry-standard security policies and procedures in place, and take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information collected on our website. This includes the use of encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, firewalls and other security technologies to prevent access to the data from unauthorized parties. All connections between users and Flocabulary are secured via encryption communication technology (SSL). All Flocabulary passwords are salted and hashed using the practices recommended by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). Flocabulary utilizes industry-standard application hosting providers who agree to perform frequent diagnostics, operating system updates, and network security monitoring. Our engineering team is committed to creating and maintaining systems to protect your personal information.

Our policy is that only employees who need to access user information in order to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to that information. All employees with access to student personally identifiable information have undergone a criminal background check. Our partners, including our outside shipping company and our credit card processing company may only use the information to provide specific services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order.

While we have taken all steps to protect your information, and continuously work to keep our systems at or above industry standard security, no system is 100% fail proof and secure. If we believe that the security of your personal information may have been compromised, we will seek to notify you as soon as possible. If we have your email address, we may notify you by email. You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification.
