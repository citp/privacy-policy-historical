If you do NOT want this type of data to collected, or if you are concerned about your privacy, there are many anonymous software programs that do not allow data collecting from websites. There are also many security software programs that can protect your privacy. In my opinion the best Security/Privacy software program is "Norton Internet Security 2005." Norton's Internet Security software has Pop-Up controls, Privacy Control, & Security Control. Norton's Internet Security can be purchased from your local computer software store or their website.

There are also many FREE software programs provided by some major search/internet providers that help protect your privacy with pop-up blockers.
