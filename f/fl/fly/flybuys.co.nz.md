####  With whom and for what purposes do we share personal information?

To operate the Fly Buys programme, we share personal information with some trusted providers of Fly Buys related services, including the operator of the Fly Buys Service Centre, mail-houses, our email deployment company, reward suppliers and providers of data analysis, data augmentation or data washing services in connection with Fly Buys marketing campaigns.

We may share your personal information with a provider of Fly Buys related services that is located in a country other than New Zealand, where we have made a business decision to use a trusted overseas based service provider that is in the business of providing data storage and/or data processing services (for example, the service provider that hosts our Fly Buys email marketing platform).

We ensure that any time we share personal information with Fly Buys service providers we do so securely and we take steps to ensure that all our service providers with whom we share personal information agree to protect the privacy and security of your personal information, destroy that data when it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was supplied to them and use that data only for the purposes for which it is disclosed.

From time to time we may share your personal information with a Fly Buys Partner (or its agent) if:

  * we consider on reasonable grounds that you have consented to that disclosure;
  * we consider on reasonable grounds that that disclosure is necessary to enable the recording of point(s) in relation to a transaction with a Fly Buys Partner;
  * you are a prize winner in a competition or promotion run by or on behalf of that Fly Buys Partner and the information is disclosed for the sole purpose of enabling notification to you that you are the prize winner and/or making arrangements for receipt of the prize; or
  * we consider on reasonable grounds that you may have been involved in fraudulent activities in relation to that Fly Buys Partner.



We may also share your Fly Buys membership card number with a Fly Buys Partner with whom you have an exisiting customer account, to link the accounts together so you can collect points for spend on that account and receive other benefits from that partner.

Personal information that relates to a transaction with a Fly Buys Partner in which a Fly Buys enabled Airpoints membership card has been used by an Airpoints member may be supplied by us to Air New Zealand in accordance with the consents given by Airpoints members under the Airpoints Terms and Conditions.

From time to time we may share your personal information in other circumstances where we are specifically allowed to under the Privacy Act 1993 (for example, in cases where the Police ask us for information to assist with its investigation of an alleged criminal offence).

####  How do we hold personal information?

We take data security very seriously. We have in place rigorous data security policies and practices aimed at mitigating the risks of unauthorised access to, and loss, misuse or wrongful alteration of, personal information held by us.

We take measures to destroy or anonymise personal information held by us if we no longer need to use it for any lawful purpose.

We are dedicated to keeping your Fly Buys membership details safe and secure from scams and fraud. If you are ever in any doubt about the authenticity of any communications that are or seem to be from Fly Buys please immediately email us at [contactus@flybuys.co.nz](mailto:contactus@flybuys.co.nz) and include a copy of the email in question.
