  * who the information will be shared with;
  * how members can opt out of Fly Buys mailings; and

Information about members and secondary cardholders (whether provided by members or secondary cardholders directly to Fly Buys, or by participating companies and/or reward providers about member transactions) will be collected by Fly Buys and held at Fly Buys' Head Office in Wellington. This information will be used by Fly Buys, and its agents, to provide services relating to the Fly Buys programme including to provide a telephone service centre, membership and secondary cards, Point Summaries and market research.

Each member consents to the collection and use of their personal and other information in the manner set out above and the disclosure of such information to Fly Buys' agents and reward providers for the purposes of operating the Fly Buys programme. Information about members and seondary cardholders may be disclosed to a participating company if:

  * the relevant member consents in writing; or 
  * Fly Buys considers on reasonable grounds that that disclosure is necessary to enable the recording of points in relation to transactions of those members or secondary cardholders; or 
  * Fly Buys considers on reasonable grounds that the member may have been involved in fraudulent activities in relation to that participating company.

Members and secondary cardholders may, under the provisions of the Privacy Act 1993, request access to and correction of their personal information held by Fly Buys. These requests must be in writing. A fee may be charged for the reasonable costs incurred in responding to these requests. Any such fee will be disclosed to the member or secondary cardholder before it is incurred.

This document should be read in conjunction with the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993 legislation.
