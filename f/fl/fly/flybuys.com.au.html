<li>Coles Myer Ltd (and its group companies) and the National Australia Bank Limited (and its group companies) will be allowed to collect your name and other personal information from FlyBuys. They may use and disclose that personal information within their corporate groups (and to their service providers) for marketing, planning, product development, research, FlyBuys account reconciliation and other related purposes (including to send you direct marketing information).</li>

<li>If you nominate an additional cardholder or provide personal information to FlyBuys about another person (for example, a family member), you will have to make sure that the person has:<ul>

<li>read and understood the FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy; and</li>

<li>agreed to their personal information being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the FlyBuys Policy on Information Privacy.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will be able to use your electronic addresses (including your e-mail address and mobile phone number for receiving SMS), to the extent that you have provided them, to let you know about upgrades to our online services (such as Reward Redemption) and to send you FlyBuys program and marketing communications.</li>

(and its group companies) or National Australia Bank Limited (and its group companies) by calling 13 1116.
