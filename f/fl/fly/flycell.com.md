# Privacy Policy - Flycell

[](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.flycell.com&sealid=101)

We at FLYCELL, INC. ("Flycell") know how much you value your privacy, so we make sure that your privacy is protected any time you are using our Services. Flycell (www.flycell.com) operates this on the World Wide Web. You do need to give us some personal information so we are able to process your orders and requests. However, we want you to know what information we need, why we need it, and how we make sure that your information is protected. We want you to be able to enjoy your Flycell experience safely and privately. 

## Your Flycell account

When you sign up with Flycell, you establish a password-protected personal account for ordering goods and services and participating in online social networks. Flycell is a PAY Site, i.e., the goods and services offered by Flycell are not free. Flycell also operates a social networking Site free of charge (collectively, the Services). 

Please note that information you provide in an optional public profile can be viewed by anyone, and can potentially be used to contact you or send you unsolicited messages. You should not post personally identifiable information in public areas of our Site, and this policy does not cover information posted in such areas. 

## Information we need from you

In order to establish your private Flycell account and/or place an order with Flycell, we need some personal information from you. This information may include contact information (such as name, email, cell phone number and address) and certain billing information, like a new cell phone number or change of carrier. 

We may occasionally request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Flycell Service. 

As you navigate within the Flycell Sites, we automatically track and collect information about your computer, PDA, telephone or other equipment that you use to access the sites. This information includes IP address, device specifications, domain server, browser specifications, mobile identification number and telecommunications identifying information. As you use our Services, we may collect information about your traveling to and use of channels and other features on Flycell Sites, and also which third party websites, WAP sites, and other sites you visit. 

In some cases, when you purchase third party goods or services through a Flycell Site, or use promotional materials, you may be asked to provide personal information to a third party provider of the goods or services. That information is subject to the privacy policy of the provider, and this privacy policy does not apply to the collection or treatment of such information via the Flycell Site. 

## Emails and SMS Messages

By registering for a Flycell account, you agree that we may send you the following types of email communications: welcome emails, our weekly newsletter, account status updates and promotional content and solicitations. You can also opt-out of specific types of email communications through your account settings by clicking on the unsubscribe link located in the footer. Upon clicking this link, you will be redirected to the unsubscribe page (http://www.flycell.com/learn-more/unsubscribe) where you can submit your email and click the unsubscribe link. Our Services feature the distribution of content to your cellular phone, and by registering for a Flycell account, you agree to receive SMS messages to your phone, including messages regarding Services you request, account status updates, and occasional SMS newsletters. You will also have the opportunity to opt-in via registration and receive surveys and promotional content by our affiliates. You may opt out of our SMS newsletter by sending an email or by responding to the SMS newsletter indicating that you would like to unsubscribe. 

Our Site may provide you with the opportunity to refer your friends, family members or relatives to the Flycell Services. For this feature of our Site to work, we need to collect your friends and families' email addresses. The email addresses we collect in this context are not used for any other purpose other than to send a one-time referral. Should you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend using our Tell-A-Friend feature about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Flycell stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at http://www.flycell.com/support to request that we remove this information from our database. 

## Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information

Flycell operates sites on behalf of some of its customers (for example, other businesses that contract with us to operate mobile storefronts or other services for them). When we operate Sites on behalf of such customers, we may disclose your information (including personally identifiable information) to them when you provide it to us as part of registering for those sites or "opting in" for promotions, programs or offerings from those customers. Our customers will use and disclose the information we provide them pursuant to their own policies regarding such information. Flycell also maintains channels and other features on Flycell's own Sites in cooperation with third parties (e.g., to feature the work of certain musicians or other artists, or record labels/publishers), and we may disclose your email address, telephone number or mobile identification number, and other personally identifiable information to such third parties when you provide it to us as part of subscribing to such channels or features. Flycell's customers and other third parties that we cooperate with will use and disclose the information we provide them pursuant to their own policies regarding such information. We recommend that you review those policies before providing us with personal information in connection with sites, promotions, programs or offerings from such third parties, and before subscribing to channels or features we operate in cooperation with third parties. In addition, traffic data and personal data may be used by Flycell for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis of users' behavior, for product development, for site improvement, and to inform advertisers of how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements or viewed their promotions. In these cases, data is maintained and reviewed on an aggregate (i.e., group) basis. We may share this information with our customers and other parties, but when we do so it does not include personally identifying information. In addition, we use traffic and personal data to customize and tailor your experience on Flycell Sites, such as to help us display content that we think you may be interested in. 

## Changing your information

## Protecting your information

Flycell uses industry best practices to protect your information and your privacy. When any personal information is requested on the site we use SSL to present secure pages to protect that it. 

You can tell if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your browser window. In Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see a lock icon. When the symbol is unbroken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you're using. You can download the latest version from the Netscape or Microsoft Web sites. Beta versions of browsers are not recommended.

We may send you Site and Service announcement updates with important information about the Service. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements. You may de-activate your account if you do not wish to receive these emails. 

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account by clicking the unsubscribe link located in the account profile section of the Flycell website. Upon confirmation that you would like to unsubscribe, you will be redirected to a settings page, where a notification will provide you of the un-subscription result.
