**_Types of Information that DCS Collects_**

DCS collects two different types of information from You when You use the Site.   We collect certain types of personally identifiable information from You (“ _Personal Information_ ”) when You register a member or affiliate account (“ _Account_ ”). We also collect certain non- personally identifiable, aggregate information from visitors to our Site regardless of whether they create or sign in to an Account (“ _Traffic Data_ ”).

Your Personal Information is used to manage Your Account and is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. In compliance with applicable laws, it is our policy to require only the Personal Information necessary to manage Your Account and enable You to participate in our programs (as applicable, the “ _Program_ ”). DCS does not condition Your participation in any specific activity on our Site on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary. 

**_Traffic Data_**

DCS may also use certain web technologies such as “cookies” to track Your use of our Site. Your browser may have an option that allows You to reject cookies, but doing so may limit Your use of our Site.  Usage Information is anonymous and does not personally identify You.  In addition, DCS may use web beacons or other tools to measure the effectiveness of, and otherwise manage, our online advertising.  These web beacons enable our advertising server to recognize You when You visit the Site and to determine which banner ads bring users to the Site.  DCS does not use spyware, adware or any other similarly intrusive software.  The Usage Information that DCS collects depends on how You choose to use this Site. 

**_Use of Your Information_**

DCS may use Your Personal Information to manage Your Account, such as responding to Your email inquiries or providing You with voluntary customer surveys to helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer to You.  In addition, DCS may use Traffic Data to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Additionally, DCS may share non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not Personal Information, with third parties to administer certain co-branded products or services. DCS does not share Your Personal Information with these advertisers or joint venture companies unless You have provided Your permission beforehand. In these instances, You will be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or feature. Finally, DCS may take the information collected in response to customer surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.
