## 7\. Security

We take appropriate steps to protect the personal information you share with us. When you book a flight or enter personally identifying information, your details are transmitted across the internet securely using high-grade encryption (128 bit). We have implemented technology and security features to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. We also follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Should we be required to disclose sensitive information to you, we may request proof of identity in adherence with our security procedures, before we are able to do so.

In the circumstances set out in this policy where flydubai passes your information to a third party, we will ensure that the security measures that such party has in place in relation to the processing

of your data are at least as stringent as those employed by flydubai. This does not apply where we are required by law to pass your information to a third party.

We will retain your information for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires.

Thus you can book and buy your ticket in all confidentiality and security, provided that the terms and regulations of use hereunder mentioned are strictly respected by the user.
