**F.              _Cookies and Similar Technologies_. **These and other third parties may collect or receive information about Your use of the Service, including through the use of [cookies, web beacons and other technologies](http://privacy.aol.com/cookies-web-beacons/), and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services, which may be used for remarketing and may track users across websites and apps and over time. For instance, Facebook and Google enable us to present users with retargeting advertising on other sites based on users’ previous interaction with the Service. You can instruct Your browser to stop accepting cookies. But if You do not accept cookies, You may not be able to use all portions of all functionality of the Service.

**(a)Cookies.   **We use cookies, which are small data files that are saved to Your device when You visit our website and use the Service.

**(i)  Type of cookies we use.      **We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is a temporary file which is only active while You are on the website and is erased once You close Your browser. Unlike a session cookie, a persistent cookie is not deleted when You close Your browser and will remain on Your device indefinitely. We use cookies to identify when You return to our website, save login information (excluding passwords), track usage statistics and store Your preferences.

**(ii)             Adjusting cookie settings on your browser.           **By default, most browsers will automatically accept cookies. However, You can disable cookies completely, or be prompted prior to a cookie being loaded, by adjusting Your browser’s settings. Consult each individual browser’s “help” feature for more information.

**(b)             Web beacons.         **Web beacons are small graphic images or other programming code (also known as “web bugs,” “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) used to keep track of Your navigation through the website and Your electronic communication with us. We may include web beacons in our web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to You, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our website, to monitor how users navigate the website, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. Web beacons may be used to collect certain personal information (for example, the email address associated with an email message).

**(c)Embedded Scripts.            **An embedded script is a programming code that is designed to collect information about Your interactions with our website, such as information about the links on which You click. The code is temporarily downloaded onto Your device from our web server or a third party service provider. The code is active only while You are connected to our website, and is deactivated or deleted once You disconnect from the website.

G. _Business Changes_. If We become involved in a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or other transaction or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business otherwise changes, We may transfer Your information to a third party or parties in connection therewith. Specifically, We may disclose information about You to third parties without Your consent where We believe that such disclosure is necessary to determine whether to proceed with a prospective business transaction or to complete a transaction in progress, or where the information is necessary to carry on the activity that was the object of the transaction. A “business transaction” includes:

i. the purchase, sale or other acquisition or disposition of an organization or a part of an organization, or any of its assets;

ii. the merger or amalgamation of two or more organizations;

v. the lease or licensing of any of an organization’s assets; and

Where obliged or permitted to disclose information without consent, We will not disclose more information than is required.

  1. **K. _Aggregated Information_.** We may share aggregated information relating to users of the Service with affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. This aggregated information does not contain personal information about any user.



We implement a variety of physical, procedural and technical security measures with respect to our offices and information storage systems and facilities to protect the safety and prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access to, disclosure, or modification of Your personal information when You enter, submit, or access Your personal information. We further protect Your personal information by restricting access to it to those employees that require access to the information in order that We may provide the Service.

Please keep Your account and device passwords secure to help ensure the safety of Your personal information.

While We take reasonable measures to protect the information You submit via the Service against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification, We cannot guarantee its absolute security. No Internet, email, or mobile application transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Email or other messages sent through the Service may not be secure. You should use caution whenever submitting information through the Service and take special care in deciding with which information You provide us.

We cannot guarantee that transmissions of Your personal information will be fully secure and that third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or the security measures of our partners. WE ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION DUE TO TRANSMISSION ERRORS, THIRD-PARTY ACCESS OR CAUSES BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

We will retain Your information for as long as You use the Service and for a reasonable time thereafter.

Please note that some or all of the information We have collected may be required in order for the Service to function properly.

When Your personal information is no longer required for Our purposes, we have procedures to destroy, delete, erase or convert it into an anonymous form.

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. The Service may contain links to other websites or apps or may forward users to other websites or apps that We may not own or operate. The links from the Service do not imply that We endorse or have reviewed these websites or apps. The policies and procedures We describe here do not apply to these websites or apps. WE NEITHER CAN CONTROL NOR GUARANTEE, REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE PRIVACY PRACTICES, CONTENT OR INFORMATION CONTAINED IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES OR APPS IS ACCURATE, LEGAL, NON-INFRINGING OR INOFFENSIVE, OR THAT SUCH WEBSITES DO NOT CONTAIN VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE OR WILL NOT OTHERWISE AFFECT YOUR COMPUTER. BY USING THE SERVICE TO LINK TO A THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE OR APP, YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSSES CAUSED OR ALLEGED TO BE CAUSED BY OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF, OR RELIANCE ON, THE SERVICE TO LINK TO A THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE OR APP.

We permit the reasonable right of access and review of Your personal information held by us and will endeavour to provide the information to You within a reasonable time. Flipp may refuse access or Your right of access may be limited in accordance with exceptions to access required or permitted by law. To guard against fraudulent requests for access, we may require sufficient information to allow us to confirm that the person making the request is authorized to do so before granting access or making corrections.

We do not routinely update Your personal information but will amend or delete Your personal information when You have indicated to us that it is inaccurate or incomplete.

You can withdraw Your consent to Our use of Your personal information at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not operate retroactively and may affect Your ability to use our Services.

Through cookies We place on Your browser or device, We and our partners may collect information about Your online activity after You leave the Service. Just like any other usage information We collect, this information allows Us to improve the Service and customize Your online experience, and otherwise as described in this privacy policy.
