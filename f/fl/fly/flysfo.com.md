## Information Collection

  * We do not collect personal information about you when you visit our websites unless you choose to provide that information to us.  
  * We use cookies to collect limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available automatically whenever you visit a website. This information includes the Internet Address of your computer, mobile device or network, the date and time of visit, pages you visit on our site, your browser and operating system, the referring page (the last webpage you visited before clicking on a link to our sites), the exit link (the next webpage you visit after clicking off of our sites), any files downloaded, any pages shared, and search terms onsite and through search engines.
  * We use the aggregated information from all of our visitors to measure server performance, analyze user traffic patterns and improve the content of our site.
