If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. "Web Beacons") in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. We may also use your email address to send updates, newsletters or other news regarding Flywheel. Users may choose not to receive email of these types by following opt-out instructions contained in such emails or by changing their notification settings under the "My Account" section of the Flywheel website.
