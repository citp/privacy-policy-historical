<strong>4. Cookies, web beacons and pixel tags and how they can benefit your website

</p>
<p>
Cookies are very small text files stored on your
hard drive. They uniquely identify your computer and allow us to store profile
information, improve website security and help us to customise your website
experience. A unique user identity is created which ensures that you are not
required to re-enter login details as you move throughout the website. Time

We contract with online partners to help manage

improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can
"opt-out" of this website analysis tool. How you do this will depend
