# Privacy Policy

## FLUKE NETWORKS’ PRIVACY POLICY

**Last Updated:** March 10, 2014

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Fluke Corporation and certain subsidiaries and affiliates, including, without limitation, Fluke Networks (collectively, "we" or "us"). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services"), or when you otherwise interact with us.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our homepage or by sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

## Collection of Information 

**Information You Provide to Us**

We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an online account and/or profile, participate in the interactive areas of our Services, fill out a form, provide us with your business card or other contact information, participate in a contest or promotion, complete a survey, sign up to receive one of our newsletters, make a purchase, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, company name and contact details, job title, industry sector, photographs, videos and any other information you choose to provide.

**Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services**

When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:

  * **Log Information:** We log information about your use of the Services, including your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, number of clicks, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.
  * **Device Information:** We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, MAC address, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information.
  * **Network Information:** We may collect information about your network, such as information about devices, nodes, configurations, connection speeds and network and application performance.
  * **Location Information:** We may collect information about the location of your mobile device each time you access or use one of our mobile applications. For more details, please see "Your Choices" below.
  * **Usage Information:** We may collect information about the use of our Services and certain tools, such as how often the tools are used, the duration and quality of use, calibration data, project configuration data and operator data.
  * **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:** Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as web beacons) are used to enhance your experience by allowing us to tailor our content based on your interests and distinguish you from other users of our Services. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that does not contain any personal data, and that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your device. A cookie can contain information, such as a user ID or preferences, which the Services use to personalize content, track the pages you've visited or to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Services. We do not track your personal data through cookies, unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering or logging on to our Services. We use the following types of cookies:
    * **Strictly necessary cookies.** These are cookies or other tracking mechanisms necessary to make our Services function as intended. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to use a shopping cart.
    * **Analytical/performance cookies.** They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Services. This helps us to improve the way our Services work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
    * **Functionality cookies.** These cookies enable us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). They may also be used to recognize you when you return to our Services.
    * **Third-party cookies.** We may allow third parties to place cookies on your device for advertising and analytics purposes. For more information about these cookies, please see “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” below.



If required by law, we will ask you for your consent to our use of cookies when you first visit our Services. We may assume that you consented from ticking a box and clicking on an “I agree” (or similar button) or by continuing to navigate on our Services despite a clear and visible notice on our Services that we use cookies. If you agree, we will place an opt-in cookie on your device. If you disagree, we will place an opt-out cookie. These will help us remember your choice and avoid asking you in the future. If you change your mind, simply delete the cookies on your device (please refer to the software provider’s documentation) and you will be asked again if you agree or disagree with our use of cookies when you visit our Services next. You can also adjust your browser settings to receive a message every time a cookie is installed on your computer or to prevent their installation altogether. Although rejection of cookies will not interfere with your ability to interact with most of our Services, you will need to accept cookies if you choose to enter areas of our Services that require registration or login. Certain other functions and/or services might be unavailable to you if you reject cookies altogether (such as remembering your choice of language).
