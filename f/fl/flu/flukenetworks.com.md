**Privacy Statement for Fluke Networks**

**Information This Site Gathers**

Therefore, you can browse this site without entering any personal information, and remain anonymous during your visit. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, and to help identify you. 

This site also includes a variety of registration and order forms that may ask for particular information about our visitors such as name, e-mail address and demographic/product usage information. Information gathered through these means is used to learn more about our visitors, provide them with requested information, and to also mail them future informational/promotional materials from Fluke and its sales/service channel partners. 

You can request to not have informational/promotional materials sent to you, as noted in the "choice/opt out" section at the end of this notice. 

An exception is the employment application form that is located within our "employment" section of the site. Names received from these forms do not receive future informational/promotional materials from Fluke or our sales/service channel partners, and are kept on a confidential basis in our employment department for current and future employment opportunities.
