This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, disclosed and otherwise processed by Fluke Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies acting as a data controller for the purpose of applicable data protection law (collectively, “we”, “our” or “us”).

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you when you use our devices, tools, websites, mobile applications and other online products and services provided by us (collectively, the “Services”), or when you otherwise interact with us. Some of this information may be personal information as it may be information about you.

**Where we need your consent to the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of your personal information (as described in this Privacy Policy), you provide such consent by accessing and using the Services. If you do not consent to such processing then do not further access or use the Services. Where we need a specific consent to a particular form of processing, such as the collection of information about your location or the use of your information for marketing, we will obtain such consent in the manner described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law.**

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our homepage or by sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information handling practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. Your continued use of the Services after such changes have been notified will constitute your consent to those changes.

A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your device. A cookie can contain information, such as a user ID or preferences, which we use to personalize content, track the pages you've visited or to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Services. We use the following types of cookies: 
    * **Strictly necessary cookies.** These are cookies or other tracking mechanisms necessary to make our Services function as intended. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to use a shopping cart.
    * **Analytical/performance cookies.** They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Services. This helps us to improve the way our Services work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
