This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used, disclosed and otherwise processed by Fluke Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies acting as a data controller for the purpose of applicable data protection law (collectively, “we”, “our” or “us”).

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect about you when you use our devices, tools, websites, mobile applications and other online products and services provided by us (collectively, the “Services”), or when you otherwise interact with us. Some of this information may be personal information as it may be information about you.

**Where we need your consent to the collection, use, disclosure, transfer or other processing of your personal information (as described in this Privacy Policy), you provide such consent by accessing and using the Services.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our homepage or by sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information handling practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. Your continued use of the Services after such changes have been notified will constitute your consent to those changes.

Your personal data will be stored on our secure servers at our offices and those of our service providers, which are located in the EEA or in the U.S. and other countries which may not have a level of data protection law equivalent to that of your country.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it as if it were staying in the EEA by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries or recipients operating under frameworks (such as the Privacy Shield in the U.S.) that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
  * We may also use specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.



Please contact us if you want further information on the specific safeguards used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

###  How do we keep your personal data secure?

We ensure the security of your personal data by putting in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect it from accidental loss, theft, misuse, alteration and unauthorized access or disclosure, and unlawful or accidental destruction.

We also take steps to ensure all our subsidiaries, agents, affiliates and suppliers employ adequate levels of security.

###  What rights do you have in relation to the personal data we hold on you?

By law, you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data, and we have summarised these below. Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country.

Rights |  What does this mean?  
---|---  
1\. The right to be informed |  You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Privacy Notice.  
2\. The right of access |  You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we’re processing it), and certain other information (similar to that provided in this Privacy Notice).

This is so you’re aware and can check that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection law.  
  
3\. The right to rectification |  You are entitled to have your information corrected if it’s inaccurate or incomplete.  
4\. The right to erasure |  This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.  
5\. The right to restrict processing |  You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future.  
6\. The right to data portability |  You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability.  
7\. The right to object to processing |  You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing based on our legitimate interests and processing for direct marketing (i.e. if you no longer want to be contacted with potential opportunities).  
8\. The right to lodge a complaint |  You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your personal data with your national data protection regulator.  
9\. The right to withdraw consent |  If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal data with your consent up to that point is unlawful). This includes your right to withdraw consent to us using your personal data for marketing purposes.  
  
###  How can you make a request to exercise your rights?

To exercise any of the rights above, or to ask a question, _contact us_ using the details set out at the end of this Privacy Notice.

###  How will we handle a request to exercise your rights?

We’ll respond as soon as we can. Generally, this will be within one month from when we receive your request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we’ll come back to you and let you know.

We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but may charge a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the information for:

  * baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or
  * further copies of the same information.



Alternatively, the law may allow us to refuse to act on the request.

###  How can you contact us?
