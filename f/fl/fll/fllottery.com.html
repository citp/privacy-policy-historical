<p>
Thank you for visiting flalottery.com. Your privacy is very important to us. Simply stated, our policy is to collect no personal information about you when you visit any of the Florida Lottery's web pages. However, if you participate in one of the Lottery On-line drawings, the information will be subject to Chapter 119, Florida Statutes, Florida's Public Records Law.
</p>

<p>
When you visit the Florida Lottery's web server, it automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed the site. This information does not result in the identification of your personal e-mail address or other personal information.
</p>

<p>
In addition, information is only gathered regarding the volume and timing of access to the site by collecting information on the date, time and pages that you visited while at the site. This is done so that the content of the site can be improved. This information is not shared with other organizations. Again, only aggregate information is collected, and your personal information is not identified.
</p>

<p>
Certain features on flalottery.com require the use of cookies for functionality.  Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make the web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major web sites use them to provide interactive features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify users' computers when they visit a web site that uses them. Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies; however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all the features on flalottery.com if you do so.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to share personal information with flalottery.com, for example, by sending a message to our ASKLOTT account, the information may be saved for a designated period of time in order to comply with the state of Florida's archiving policies; however, information will not be disclosed to third parties or other government agencies unless required by state or federal law.
</p>

<p>
If you have other questions about flalottery.com privacy policies, or have suggestions on how these policies can be improved, please feel free to e-mail us at <a href="mailto:asklott@flalottery.com">asklott@flalottery.com</a> or contact us by telephone at (850) 487-7777.
