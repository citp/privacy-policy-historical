We collect information about you and our former members from the following sources:

**Important Information About Procedures For Opening a New Account**  


To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.

**FACT Act Disclosure (Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions)**

We may report information about your account(s) to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.

**You should know that credit bureaus are permitted to sell your name, address and other contact information to companies that wish to market to you their credit or insurance products or services. To stop the credit bureaus from selling your contact information, you may call 1-888-567-8688.**

**In addition, to stop telemarketers from calling you, you may enroll in the National Do Not Call Registry by calling 1-888-382-1222. By enrolling, telemarketers may not call you to sell goods or services unless you have a previous business relationship with them.**
