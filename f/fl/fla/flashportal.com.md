For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other, non-personal information such as your age, date of birth, gender, and platform preferences; and, combine such information with your personal information. In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding the capabilities of your computer to Flashportal.com. Flashportal.com may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide such information to advertisers and/or our partners. In addition, Flashportal.com may use such information for security or enforcement purposes.

_**Who is collecting your information?**_

When you are asked for information while on a Flash Portal site, you are sharing that information with Flashportal.com, its parent, and its various affiliates and sister companies, unless specifically stated otherwise.

We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for a Flash Portal site or product, or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with Flash Portal rights or property, other users of a Flashportal.com site or product, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities. As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Flashportal.com and will become part of our normal business records.
