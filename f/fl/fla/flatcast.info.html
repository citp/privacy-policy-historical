These data are collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.</p> <p><strong>What do we use your data for?</strong></p> <p>Part of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of the website. Other data can be used to analyze how visitors use the site.</p> <p><strong>What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong></p> <p>You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge. You also have the right to request that it be corrected, blocked, or deleted.

<h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>
<h3>Data protection</h3> <p>The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p> <p>If you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p> <p>Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.</p>
<h3>Notice concerning the party responsible for this website</h3> <p>The party responsible for processing data on this website is:</p> <p>Rade Petrovic<br>
Bgm.-Lober-Str. 2<br>
D-91781 Weißenburg</p>

<p>Telephone: +49 (9141) 8771959<br>
Email: info@flatcast.com</p>
 <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
<h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h3> <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<h3>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3> <p>If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the German state in which our company is headquartered. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html" target="_blank">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html</a>.</p>
<h3>Right to data portability</h3> <p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
<h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3> <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.</p> <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<h3>Information, blocking, deletion</h3> <p>As permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed.

<h3>Opposition to promotional emails</h3> <p>We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in the context of website legal notice requirements with regard to sending promotional and informational materials not expressly requested. The website operator reserves the right to take specific legal action if unsolicited advertising material, such as email spam, is received.</p>
<h2>3. Data collection on our website</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3> <p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.</p> <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p> <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.

The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>Server log files</h3> <p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in "server log files". These are:</p> <ul> <li>Browser type and browser version</li> <li>Operating system used</li> <li>Referrer URL</li> <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li> <li>Time of the server request</li> <li>IP address</li> </ul> <p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p> <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p>

You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p> <p>We will continue to store the data collected during registration for as long as you remain registered on our website. Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.</p>
