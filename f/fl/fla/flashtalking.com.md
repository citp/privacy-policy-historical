# Privacy Policy & Cookies - Flashtalking

_Last Updated: June 22, 2018_

## **Overview**

Flashtalking and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Flashtalking,” “we,” “us” or “our”) provides an interactive advertising technology that delivers advertisements on behalf of advertisers and allows them to serve ads that are customized to users’ interests and to understand how users respond to their ads (the “Services”). Once an ad has been purchased by an advertiser, Our Services allow the advertiser to serve ads, and tailor those ads such that they are more likely to be of interest and value to users of the internet and mobile apps. Flashtalking and the advertisers we work with are fully committed to preserving the privacy of users who see advertisements delivered by Flashtalking.

Flashtalking does not create consumer profiles or audiences, and never brokers or monetizes data to 3rd-parties; data is owned (controlled) by the respective advertisers, and Flashtalking does not pool consumer data across clients/advertisers. Flashtalking does not have any role in user targeting for media-buying or selling.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy. We encourage you to check back regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

### **Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies used by the Flashtalking Platform**

Flashtalking’s platform uses various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons, web storage, advertising device identifiers, and similar technologies. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help to recognize that the same device has been seen before, and where, in the context of a client’s ad campaign.  This helps indicate if an ad is effective for the advertiser, and helps the advertiser tailor messages, offers, recommendations, and promoted content to your preferences over time. For example, once and ad has been bought, a client may use our technology to show you ads that they think will be of particular interest based on your web browsing activity. The Flashtalking platform may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services and help perform a variety of functions, including delivering cookies, counting visits, and understanding usage.

Non-cookie technologies can also be used to recognize your device in order to show you ads that are tailored to your interests and to understand how you interact with the ads we show. For example, your device might be identified through the IP address from which you interact with the Services and the user agent string broadcast by your browser or device. For more information about the choices available to you with respect to our use of information about your browser or device for interest-based advertising purposes, please see “Your Choices” below.

## **Collection of Information**

### **Information We Collect Automatically Through the Services**

In order to serve advertisements to your web browser and to help our customers provide ads that are relevant to your interests, we automatically collect certain information when you access websites that incorporate our Services or otherwise interact with our Services. This information does not identify you individually, but it does reflect information about the websites and mobile apps you visit and use and how you interact with the ads we serve.

  * Browser and Device Information: We collect information at the time of the ad being served about your browser and device, including your browser type, device type, IP address, user agent string, operating system, mobile carrier (if applicable), connection type and identifiers assigned to your browser or device, such as the advertising identifiers assigned by platform providers.  This information does not directly identify a natural person or individual, nor is tied to “sensitive information” under GDPR.
  * Usage Data: We collect information about the websites and mobile apps you visit, including the date and time your browser or device accesses such websites or apps and the specific pages accessed;
  * Click and Search Data: We collect information about the ads that you click on and the search terms you employ within the Services.

For more details, please see “Your Choices” below. We also infer information about your general (non-specific) location based on your IP address.



### **Collection of Personal Information**

Although our Services are designed to avoid collecting information that identifies you personally, in certain cases, at the request of an advertiser or publisher, a Flashtalking ad may be designed to enable the collection of data such as your town, zip code, or gender.  This information is provided to the advertiser or publisher who sponsored the ad or its authorized service provider and is not used by Flashtalking for any other purpose. The advertiser or publisher’s collection and use of personal information is governed by such advertiser or publisher’s privacy policy.

Flashtalking does not collect or use data for advertising purposes which directly identifies an individual or is tied to “sensitive information” such as name, postal address, social security numbers or other government issued identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, sexual orientation, or precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions. We do not personalize any ads based on any health-related topics.

### **Grounds for Using Your Personal Data**

When administering the website, Flashtalking acts as a data controller.  While collecting and processing Ad data, Flashtalking acts as a data processor, relying on the following lawful grounds to collect and process your personal data:

  * **Legitimate business interests**. We may use your personal data for our legitimate business interests to improve our websites and content, and to optimize your experience. Consistent with our legitimate business interests and any choices that we offer or consents that may be required under applicable laws and regulations, we may use personal data and technical information for direct marketing.
  * **Performance of contract.** We will need to collect and use your personal data to fulfill a contract with a client of Flashtalking, who has paid us to display advertisements. For example, when you visit a website which our clients and partners offer advertising services, Flashtalking will display an ad and collect the relevant information about the display of the advertisement.
  * **User Consent.** We may use personal data described in this Privacy Policy subject to your consent. Notably and where required by applicable laws and regulations, we will rely on your consent for electronic marketing and personalization of message content, which may include collecting information from your mobile device or computer. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the opt-out and preference management mechanisms provided within the message or by contacting us as described in this Privacy Policy. Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of consent-based processing before consent was withdrawn.



## **Use of Information**

We use the information we collect to help our clients understand how their ads are performing, to serve ads that are targeted to your interests, and to understand, measure, and report on how users interact with the Services. We also use the information we collect from the Service to maintain and constantly improve upon the Services.

## **Your Choices**

### **Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising**

Please go to our Opt Out Page located here – <https://www.flashtalking.com/optout/>

### **Request removal of your Personal Data for EU citizens**

Please request from the Advertiser network or you may request by emailing [privacy@flashtalking.com](mailto:privacy@flashtalking.com).  The Opt Out above is a self-initiated action which will accomplish the same goal.

### **Data Subject Rights (EU only)**

This section addresses the Article 12 requirement for Transparent information, communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the data subject.  An individual consumer who seeks access to personal data concerning them, or who seeks to correct, amend, request processing restrictions, object to processing, or delete personal data or exercise a right of portability should direct his or her query to the respective Flashtalking clients.

Flashtalking abides by the Data Subject Rights requests referenced within GDPR Articles 13-22 with respect to:

  * Right to be informed (about processing activities and applicable rights)
  * Right to access data (or obtain data being processed)
  * Right to rectify information (when outdated or incorrect)
  * Right to erasure (and to be publicly forgotten)
  * Right to object to processing (particularly activities based on consent)
  * Right to restrict processing (when processing is deemed to be unlawful)
  * Right to data portability (between proprietary systems in a common format)
  * Rights related to automated decision making (including decisions based on profiling activities)



Flashtalking and its subsidiaries and partners have put into place operational processes to comply with all Data Subject Rights requests within 30 days when received, however we may need to verify certain Personal data fields to ensure we act upon the correct data.

### **_Right to be Informed about Processing (Articles 13 and 14):_**

  * We respect and acknowledge that individuals frequently desire to access their personal information. However, we have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process on behalf of our customers. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete data should direct his or her query to the respective Advertiser. If Flashtalking is requested to provide assistance by said Advertiser, we will respond/act within 30 days. You may also Opt Out of our services, in which case, we will no longer process your Personal information.



### **_Right to access data (or obtain data being processed) (Article 15):_**

  * A user should first request this from the Advertiser, as we process data on their behalf (processor rather than controller) and as such we will also need their consent to release. We will then request verification of personal data prior to release of the information. If such information cannot be verified, we reserve the right to withhold fulfilment the request.



### **_Right to rectify information (when outdated or incorrect) (Article 16):_**

  * Once data access is given, as per Article 15, the user has the right to rectify. However, as this data is collected from the device at the time of the ad being served, it is usually factual (at the time).  Flashtalking has a Contractual Obligation to report on advertisements being served, so the users personal data is not relevant to the ad serve action, which we are obligated to report.



### **_Right to erasure (and to be publicly forgotten) (Article 17):_**

  * Once Flashtalking’s Contractual Obligations are fulfilled, the user data may be overwritten/deleted to fully anonymize the individual upon written request and verification, as per Article 15. However, based on user action, they may appear in our system with a new GUID/Cookie ID.  The Opt Out mechanism fulfils the user’s objective without risk of a new GUID or entry into our database.



### **_Right to restrict processing (when processing is deemed to be unlawful) (Article 18):_**

  * Flashtalking will suppress unique identifiers to halt processing if requested to by the Advertiser and individual following the actions in Article 15 and 17. User can also accomplish by the Opt Out mechanism.



### **_Right to data portability (between proprietary systems in a common format) (Article 20):_**

  * Flashtalking’s system is unique and proprietary making data portability difficult however if requested to, we will act in accordance of Article 15 provided that as per Article 20, a common format is available.



### **_Right to object to processing (particularly activities based on consent) (Article 21):_**

  * Similar to Article 17, users may object to processing by either requesting from the Advertiser or via our Opt Out mechanism. Flashtalking will comply with all such requests.



### **_Rights related to automated decision making (including decisions based on profiling activities) (Article 22):_**

  * While Flashtalking is a member of the advertising community, Flashtalking systems do not rely on any fully automated decision making, making this Article unlikely to apply to Flashtalking activities.
