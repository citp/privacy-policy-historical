# Privacy Policy & Cookies - Flashtalking

_Last Updated: December 6, 2016_

Flashtalking and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“Flashtalking,” “we” or “us”) provides an interactive advertising technology that delivers advertisements on behalf of advertisers and allows them to serve ads that are targeted to users’ interests and to understand how users respond to their ads (the “Services”). Our Services allow brands to serve ads that are more likely to be of interest and value to users of the internet and mobile apps. Flashtalking and the advertisers we work with are fully committed to preserving the privacy of users who see advertisements delivered by Flashtalking.  This Privacy Policy describes how Flashtalking collects, uses, and discloses information when you visit this website (“the Site”) and websites and mobile applications from which Flashtalking collects data.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy. We encourage you to check back regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

Flashtalking is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to NAI Code of Conduct as well as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles.

## **Information We Collect Automatically Through the Services**

In order to serve advertisements to your web browser and to help our customers provide ads that are relevant to your interests, we automatically collect certain information when you access websites that incorporate our Services or otherwise interact with our Services. This information does not identify you personally, but it does reflect information about the websites and mobile apps you visit and use and how you interact with the ads we serve.

  * Browser and Device Information: We collect information about your browser and device, including your browser type, device type, IP address, user agent string, operating system, mobile carrier, connection type and identifiers assigned to your browser or device, such as the advertising identifiers assigned by platform providers.
  * Usage Data: We collect information about the websites and mobile apps you visit, including the date and time your browser or device accesses such websites or apps and the specific pages accessed;
  * Click and Search Data: We collect information about the ads that you click on and the search terms you employ within the Services.
  * Location Information: If permitted by your browser or device, we may collect information about the precise location of your device for the purposes of serving ads that may be more relevant to you or helping to understand how you responded to ads served to you. For more details, please see “Your Choices” below. We also infer information about your general location based on your IP address.



## **Information We Collect from Other Sources**

We may also obtain other information that does not identify you personally from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, we may collect information about you from third parties, including our business partners, other advertising companies, and publicly available sources.

## **Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies We Use**

We use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons, web storage, advertising device identifiers, and similar technologies. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to tailor recommendations and promoted content to your preferences over time. For example, we may use your web browsing information to show you ads that we think will be of particular interest to you. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services and help perform a variety of functions, including delivering cookies, counting visits, and understanding usage. We also use non-cookie technologies to recognize your device in order to show you ads that are tailored to your interests and to understand how you interact with the ads we show. For example, we may identify your device through the IP address from which you interact with the Services and the user agent string broadcast by your browser or device. For more information about the choices available to you with respect to our use of information about your browser or device for interest-based advertising purposes, please see “Your Choices” below.

## **Collection of Personal Information**

Although our Services are designed to avoid collecting information that identifies you personally, in certain cases, at the request of an advertiser or publisher, a Flashtalking ad may be designed to enable the collection of data such as your town, zip code, or gender, as well as personal information such as your email address or your friend’s email address (such as to enable a “refer a friend” feature). This information is provided to the advertiser or publisher who sponsored the ad or its authorized service provider and is not used or retained by Flashtalking for any other purpose. The advertiser or publisher’s collection and use of personal information is governed by such advertiser or publisher’s privacy policy. Flashtalking is not responsible for the privacy or information practices of its advertiser or publisher partners.

Flashtalking does not collect or use any sensitive data for advertising purposes, including social security numbers or other government issued identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, sexual orientation, or precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions. We do not target any ads based on any health-related topics.

We use the information we collect to help our clients understand how their ads are performing, to serve ads that are targeted to your interests, and to understand, measure, and report on how users interact with the Services. We also use the information we collect from the Service to maintain and constantly improve upon the Services.

We may share the information we collect as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:

  * With our advertising and publishing clients, so that they understand how their ads are performing;
  * With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work or perform services on our behalf;
  * In response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, rule, regulation or legal process;
  * If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Flashtalking or others;
  * In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company; and
  * Between and among Flashtalking and any current or future parent, subsidiary and/or affiliated company.
