			Contractual obligation: if you gave us your personal information in connection with the order you placed with us, we need this information to deliver the Goods or Services to you.</li>
		<li>
			Legal obligation: in some cases, it is required by the law to collect and store your Personal Information. For example, tax laws require that we keep all the sales records and, in some cases, share it with local tax authorities.</li>
		<li>
			Legitimate interest: for some data, we have good and fair reason to use it in such ways that do not hurt your interests and rights.
