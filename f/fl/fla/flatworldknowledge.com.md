California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers and is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.

With content owners. We may share a variety of information with content owners (including the authors and those who have rights in the books, homework assignments, assessments and other content we offer through FlatWorld). FlatWorld may share contact information of verified instructors. FlatWorld may also share de-identified or aggregate data about you and your use of the Product with Content Owners. Content Owners will use this data for their own research and tracking purposes, to evaluate Product use and access, to improve Products and related analysis.

For marketing purposes. We may share information with third parties for the purpose of having them market, or assist us in marketing, our Products to educational institutions and educators.

With resellers and others who carry our content. We may make certain FlatWorld content available on other platforms, but do not share personally identifiable information with those other platforms. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of those third parties before sharing personal information with them.

We may disclose to anyone, including third parties or the general public, the names of educators and institutions who have adopted certain Products for use in their classes.

Third Party Service Providers. We use other companies, agents, contractors, and/or FlatWorld affiliates to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with providing the Products to you. For example, we may engage such service providers to provide marketing (including telemarketing, email and direct mail marketing), communications, website hosting infrastructure and IT services, personalize and optimize the Service, process credit card transactions, provide customer service, collect debts, and analyze and enhance data. In the course of providing such services to us, these other companies may have access to your information, or may share with us information they collect in the course of providing their services. We do not authorize these companies to use or disclose your personal information, except in connection with providing the services we request from them.

For legal and safety reasons. We reserve the right to disclose your information, including your personally identifiable information, when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is necessary to (a) comply with any law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce our terms of use, including investigation of potential violations of our terms of use; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect against harm to our rights, property, or safety, or those of our employees, users, or the public, as required or permitted by law.

Change of Control. If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, including bankruptcy, our assets, including Member account information and personally identifiable information, may be transferred to a third party. At that time, your Member account information and personally identifiable information may become subject to that third-party’s privacy policy.
