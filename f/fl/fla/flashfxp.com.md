**FlashFXP Privacy Policy**

At IniCom Networks, our utmost goal is to provide you with the absolute best FTP/FXP client available. In this day and age of widespread Internet usage, privacy has become a major concern for everyone. We aim to be open and honest about what our software does, and how we use the information you provide when you browse our website, participate in our forums, and purchase/use our software.

  * **Website & Forums**  
When you browse our website, download our software, or participate in our online forums, your ip address, the time and duration of your visit, the web browser you are using, and the pages you view are logged. This information is used to compile statistical reports about how you use our website and ultimately used to improve your browsing experience. If you choose to register for our forums, a valid email address is required, but all other information is optional. Any information you provide is used only for the FlashFXP website, and is never given out or sold to any 3rd party. Our forums are moderated, and we reserve the right to remove any post we deem inappropriate, and any user account being used inappropriately. The purpose of our website and forums is to provide the best support possible to our valued customers.

  * **Software: Trial Version**  
Absolutely no personal information is required to download and try out our software. Additionally, while in trial mode, FlashFXP will never send ANY information to us or any of our servers. FlashFXP is yours to try for free, without obligation, and without restriction.

  * **Software: Registered Version**  
If you choose to register FlashFXP, some personal information is required to complete the purchase. Things like your name/company, address, and billing information like your credit card number is collected. Your billing information is only used to complete the sale, and is NOT stored in any database. All methods of purchase are ssl encrypted and detailed information can be obtained from the website at time of purchase. Your personal information is securely stored, and is never given out to anyone, or used by us for anything other than a purchase record.

  * **Software: Liveupdate**  
LiveUpdate is a special feature of the registered version of FlashFXP. It allows for a convenient method to update the FlashFXP software. Because this is a registered version only feature, and to keep our download servers from becoming overloaded, a crc hash of your registration key is sent as an authentication token when LiveUpdate connects to our servers. No other information is transmitted.

  * **Software: Fraud/Piracy**  
We aim to keep your information safe. Credit card fraud, identity theft and software piracy will not be tolerated. We may release any information necessary to comply with the law, protect our software licenses, and foremost to protect our valued customers. We will also work with law enforcement and fraud/credit agencies to ensure the safety of your information.
