_Important Notice to Non-U.S. Residents_

Our servers are located in the US. If you are located outside of the US, please be aware that any information provided to us, including personal information, will be transferred from your country of origin to the US.

Flashpoint has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability (the “Privacy Shield Principles”). If there is a conflict between this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

Flashpoint is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.

In compliance with the EU-US and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Flashpoint commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact Flashpoint at [privacy@flashpoint-intel.com](mailto:privacy@flashpoint-intel.com) with the subject line, “ **Privacy Shield**.” Flashpoint has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.

_Onward Transfer to Third Parties under the Privacy Shield_

Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information and their functions are: direct marketing assistance, lead generation services, order fulfillment, billing, customer service, data storage, hosting services, disaster recovery services, and sales support companies. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by Flashpoint. We may also disclose personal information to our affiliates in order to support marketing, sale and delivery of Products. 

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Flashpoint\’s accountability for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Flashpoint remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Flashpoint proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

_Opt-In and Opt-Out to Certain Onward Transfers under the Privacy Shield_ ****

Individuals have the opportunity to opt-out of sharing of their personal data with third parties other than our agents or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
