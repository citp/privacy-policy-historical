Please allow us a reasonable time to process your request. With regard to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, we remain liable if our agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Opt-In to Certain Onward Transfers

We will not transfer your personal information to a third party controller without first providing you with information regarding the identity of such controller or the nature of such controller’s business, and obtaining your opt-in consent.

Business Transfers

In the event of a merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal information, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such personal information as set forth in this privacy policy.
