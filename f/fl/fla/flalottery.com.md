The Florida Lottery recognizes the importance of privacy to visitors of the Florida Lottery website. Therefore, visitors should be aware of the following information:

## Public Records

Visitors should be aware that, subject to certain statutory exceptions, most documents and records maintained by the state of Florida, including but not limited to electronic data, are public records under Florida law. Therefore, information submitted through this website may be subject to disclosure pursuant to a public records request. Records required to be maintained pursuant to the laws of Florida will be retained and disposed of in accordance with applicable record retention schedules.

## Usage Statistics

In order to generate usage statistics to help us improve our website, we automatically collect certain information on every visitor to the website. However, this information does not disclose "personal identifiers" (such as name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.). Each time a request is made to view a page within this website, our website creates a log file capturing generic user information. Examples of this type of information includes the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the date and time you accessed this site, the Internet protocol address of the individual computer (or proxy server) making the request, and the Internet address of the site from which you may have linked to this site. All information collected by way of server log files is used in aggregate form only, and may be analyzed for trends and statistics.

## Online Forms and Email

This website will not collect personally identifiable information (such as name, address, telephone number, etc.) unless you provide such information voluntarily. We may ask for such information so that we can tailor interactive features of this website to your specific interests and needs (including periodically forwarding information that matches your selected interests). You are free to provide or to not provide the requested information. If you choose to not provide this type of information, you can still visit most of the website, but you may be unable to participate in certain online forums. Any personal information voluntarily provided by visitors, including personal information submitted on online forms and email, will be used for the purposes stated on the web page and may also be shared with other agencies as required by law or pursuant to agency authority. Information submitted through this website also may be subject to disclosure pursuant to a public records request.
