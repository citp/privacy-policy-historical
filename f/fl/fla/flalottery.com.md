# Florida Lottery Internet Provacy Policy

Thank you for visiting flalottery.com. Your privacy is very important to us. Simply stated, our policy is to collect no personal information about you when you visit any of the Florida Lottery web pages. 

When you visit the Florida Lottery's Web server it automatically recognizes only the Internet domain and IP address from which you accessed the site. This information does not result in the identification of your personal e-mail address or other personal information.

In addition, information is only gathered regarding the volume and timing of access to the site by collecting information on the date, time and pages that you visited while at the site. This is done so that the content of the site can be improved. This information is not shared with other organizations. Again, only aggregate information is collected, and your personal information is not identified.

If you choose to share personal information, for example, by sending a message to our ASKLOTT account, the information may be saved for a designated period of time in order to comply with the state of Florida's archiving policies. However, information will not be disclosed to third parties or other government agencies, unless required by state or federal law. If you have other questions about flalottery.com privacy policies, or have suggestions on how these policies can be improved, please feel free to e-mail us at [asklott@flalottery.com](mailto:asklott@flalottery.com) or contact us by telephone at (850-487-7777).
