Codemasters respects your privacy. This document explains our policy relating to your personal data that is provided to us.

Codemasters is the trading name of The Codemasters Software Company Limited whose registered office and headquarters are at Lower Farm, Stoneythorpe, Southam, Warwickshire, CV47 2DL, United Kingdom. The website is www.codemasters.com ("the Site").

We will deal with your personal data in compliance with the current UK data protection legislation. Please note this applies only to Codemasters not to other companies' or organisations' websites to which we link. Personal data will be collected, processed and used by Codemasters for the purposes of providing Codemasters' services and products to you and the other purposes mentioned below.

We may hold personal data relating to the transactions you enter into with others (such as an online seller) or us through the Site. We will disclose personal data to a party to the transaction to assist your transaction. When you purchase an item from us, we collect your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card details for the purpose of processing your order and notifying you of the status of your order. This allows us to involve you in our purchasing process, to administer the purchasing process, to fulfil our obligations and to notify you if there are any issues with the purchasing process as well as to arrange for payment. Information may be used to check your credit status and credit account details for ordering purposes and to bill for services or products used or purchased. We may use the data collected to obtain clearance of your credit card payment.

We may use personal data to let you know about products and services that may be of particular interest to you. We may also want to provide you with related information from third parties that we think may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, please send an e-mail to:

Because the Internet infrastructure is global, the information you provide may be transferred outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") to countries that do not have similar data protection legislation. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers.

Unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy data relating to you will not be disclosed to any third party unless you have specifically given your consent. We will not rent or sell your personal information without your permission (other than as part of a sale of the whole or a substantial part of the assets of Codemasters).

When you register for any of Codemasters' services, newsletters, mailing lists, competitions or promotions we will require information identifying you so that we can provide the service requested.

Our success relies on us producing games that our customers want to play. To help us to ensure we make the very best games we may from time to time analyse the data that we hold and such analysis may be made to find out what is most likely to appeal to individual customers and web-site users. Also, we may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, browser type, operating system, Internet, domain, demographic and profile data, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third parties, but these statistics will not include personally identifying information. We hope that this will provide you with a more interesting and fun experience. We may provide your information to our customer service agencies for similar purposes. We or our agents and sub-contractors may occasionally contact you including by post, email or telephone to tell you more about our products and services or to ask you for your feedback and comments on our products and services.
