  * **Social Media.** The We Company collects Personal Information to enable you to use online social media resources, including the use of our Member Network (MENA). If you register or log into your account through a third-party social media service, we will have access to some of your account information from that service, such as your name and other information in that account, as authorized by your settings on that service. You have the ability to disable the connection between our Services and your third-party social media account(s) at any time.

The information collected through the use of Google Analytics is not combined with your Personal Information.

We also may use other third-party analytics tools to collect similar information about use of certain online Services.

  * **Mobile Computing.** We provide websites and online resources that are specifically designed to be compatible and used on mobile computing devices. Mobile versions of the Services may require you to log in with an account. In such cases, information about use of each mobile version of the website may be associated with user accounts. In addition, The We Company enables you to download an application, widget, or other tool that can be used on mobile or other computing devices. Some of these tools may store information on mobile or other devices. These tools transmit Personal Information to The We Company to enable you to access your user accounts and to enable The We Company to track use of these tools. Some of these tools enable you to e-mail reports and other information from the tool.

We also collect certain information about you that is not Personal Information. This may include intellectual property or other company information you share with us or through the Services, in accordance with any applicable agreements between you or, if applicable, your company, including, for example, trademarks, logos, and other intellectual property you own.

In addition, we collect and/or generate anonymized and aggregated information from your use of the Services. We use anonymized and aggregated information in various ways, including to measure your interest in and use of portions or features of the Services. Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information.

## 4\. SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We disclose your Personal Information in limited circumstances to The We Company, our community, our service providers and advertisers, and other end users, in order to provide our Services and to improve ways of working in our community. Where required by applicable law, we will only share your Personal Information with particular third parties with your consent.

  * **Among The We Company.** We may share your Personal Information among The We Company depending on where you are located and the Services that you use. The We Company uses your information in accordance with this Policy.

  * **Our Community.** Our Services include online and offline member communities, forums, networks, and other features through which you may share information and connect with others. This includes:

    * Our Services may make member networks, chat rooms, forums, and/or other groups available to users. Remember that anyone can read, collect, or use your postings on a network or forum or in a chat room or group and we cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party’s use of information that you publicly disclose online.

    * We foster our community by creating profiles for members or permitting members to create their own profiles on member networks or forums. Typically, such a profile contains your name, the name of your company, and other information you provide or add to your profile (content, comments, photos, etc.). Depending on the Services you use, this profile might be created automatically and be accessible to other members of the network or forum. The Made by We Member Network profile information is accessible to all members. You can also share your profile with a broader audience (e.g., via social media).

    * When we receive information about you in connection with your relationship with our members or clients—for example, if you are a member’s employee or if you are visiting one of our clients—we may share your information with the member or client with which you have such a relationship, for example, by alerting the member or client that you have arrived to visit. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of our members or clients, or their third-party service providers, including those they integrate with our Services.

    * We also may share information about you with others in the community to provide you with certain features. For example, if you sign up for a mentoring program, we may share information about you with potential mentors.

  * **Service Providers.** We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of services on our behalf. We take steps to ensure that these service providers act only in line with our instructions and on our behalf, or otherwise use Personal Information as described in this Policy.

  * **Research / Survey Solicitations.**   From time to time, we will share your Personal Information to perform research (online and offline) via surveys on our behalf. Participation is voluntary, and we will use the information that we collect for research and reporting purposes, and to help us to improve the quality of our Services. We use the survey responses to determine the effectiveness of our Services, including the quality of our communications and our advertising and/or promotional activities. If you participate in a survey, your responses will be used along with other participants’ responses.

  * **Third-Party Advertising Partners.**   We share limited Personal Information with third parties that serve our advertising online, so that they can display our advertisements to individuals who may find them most relevant. We share this information in order to meet our legitimate interests in advertising our products effectively.

    * to comply with the law or respond to legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity or law enforcement;

  * **Other Parties in Connection with a Corporate Transaction.**   We disclose or share your information in the event that we purchase, sell, finance, transfer, or acquire all or a portion of a business or assets, such as in connection with a merger, or in the event of a bankruptcy reorganization or liquidation.

  * **Other Third-Party Partners, With Your Consent.**   We may request your consent to share Personal Information about you with certain third parties so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials that may be of interest to you. With your consent, we also use and publicize your name, likeness, and other personal characteristics and private information for advertising, promotion, and other commercial and business purposes.




### 4.1 THIRD PARTIES THAT PROVIDE CONTENT OR FUNCTIONALITY ON OUR SERVICES

We partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the Personal Information described in this Policy. For example:

  * Third-parties that provide features and functionality on the Services by means of plug-ins. Even if you do not click on or interact with social networking services or other plug-ins, they collect information about you, such as your IP address and the pages that you view.

  * Advertising providers help us and our advertisers provide advertisements on our Services or elsewhere, including advertisements that are targeted based on your online behavior, and analytics companies help us measure and evaluate the usage of our services.

  * Other content providers offer products and services on our Services and operate contests, sweepstakes, or surveys on our Services.




We, as well as certain of these third-party partners may use tracking tools (e.g., cookies, web beacons, and Internet technologies) to collect information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP address or page(s) visited). For more information on these types of tracking tools, please see our [Cookies Policy](https://www.wework.com/legal/cookie-policy). We also share such information that we have collected with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) to deliver future targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-WeWork related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.”

Some of these companies participate in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising. Please visit the websites operated by the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/), the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/), and the European Interactive Advertising Digital Alliance (EDAA) to learn more. Canadian users may also visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada. Further information in local languages is available at [www.aboutads.info](https://www.aboutads.info/) or [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

### 4.2 SOCIAL MEDIA

We are active on social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.) and share information, images, and video with the public through unaffiliated external social media sites. We encourage you to read their policies. Remember that the social media sites are public, which means that anyone can see your posts, and your posts may even show up in search engine results.

While we will not edit comments, we may delete a comment from our page on a social media site if it, for example, does not relate to the post, promotes a commercial product or service, uses obscene, threatening, or harassing language, or if it is a personal attack or hate speech that targets or disparages any ethnic, racial, age, or religious group (or other legally protected group), or if it advocates illegal activity or violates copyright laws.

## 5\. RIGHTS IN YOUR INFORMATION: ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, ERASURE, AND RESTRICTION

We value your rights to your data. In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to (i) request confirmation of whether we store, use, or share any of your Personal Information; (ii) obtain access to or a copy of your Personal Information; (iii) receive an electronic copy of Personal Information that you have provided to us, or ask us to send that information to another company (the “right of data portability”); (iv) restrict our uses of your Personal Information or, as described above, object to those uses; (v) seek correction of inaccurate, untrue, or incomplete Personal Information; or (vi) request erasure of Personal Information held about you by The We Company, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law.

Prior to disclosing Sensitive Personal Information to a third party or processing Sensitive Data for a purpose other than its original purpose or a purpose authorized subsequently by the data subject, WeWork will endeavor to obtain your explicit consent (opt-in). Where your consent for the processing of Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract, The We Company will comply with the law or contract.

### 6.2 EMAIL AND TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS

  * **Opting-Out of Marketing Communications.**   We provide a means to unsubscribe in our marketing-related email communications. Note that we will continue to send transaction-related emails regarding products or services that you have requested following an unsubscribe. We may also need to send you certain communications regarding operation and administration of the Services, and you will not be able to opt out of those communications, e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Use or this Policy. If you no longer desire to be contacted by us, you must terminate your relationship with The We Company and can no longer use our Services.

  * **Collaboration.** We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We may partner with other organizations to run events or programs.

Please refer to that organization’s privacy policy for information on how to opt-out of its communications.

  * **Text Messages.** We may send you SMS text messages related to our Services or transactions. You can opt-out of these messages at any time by replying STOP.




### 6.3 COMPLIANCE WITH THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING ALLIANCE

As part of this service, The We Company’s online advertisements may sometimes be delivered with icons that help individuals understand how their data are being used and provide options to restrict that use.

Your information will likely be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to or stored in another country, including countries that may have privacy protections less stringent than your jurisdiction. In accordance with applicable law, we implement measures, such as standard data protection clauses, to ensure that any transferred Personal Information remains protected and secure. You can obtain further information about these measures by contacting us using the contact details set out below in Section 12.5.

## 9\. RETENTION

The We Company will retain your Personal Information for as long as you have a relationship with us, and for a period after your relationship with us has ended.

  * Maintain business records for analysis and/or audit purposes;

  * Comply with record retention requirements under the law;

  * Defend or bring any existing or potential legal claims; or

The security of all Personal Information provided to The We Company is important to us. The We Company takes reasonable steps endeavoring to use appropriate technical or organizational measures to protect your Personal Information, including against unauthorized or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while The We Company strives to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to The We Company, and you do so at your own risk. As such, we ask that you help us be safer together by implementing your own security controls, such as a strong password, not sharing your credentials or badge with others, logging out when you leave your desk, and other security best practices.

## 11\. AUTOMATED PROCESSING

In the future, we may use automated processes to help us determine your eligibility for new services, alternate space, or other business-related opportunities. In such cases, if and as applicable, and to the extent required by applicable law, we will endeavor to implement suitable safeguards, including, for example, an opportunity for you to request human intervention, express your point of view, contest any decisions made, or request that we restrict the use of your Personal Information for the purposes of these automated decisions.

You may request such removal by emailing us at privacy@wework.com.
