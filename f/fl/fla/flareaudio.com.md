For the purposes of this policy, Flare means Flare Audio Limited, with registered offices at Unit 11, Chartwell Business Centre, Chartwell Road, Lancing, West Sussex, United Kingdom BN15 8FB.

Like many companies, we use technology on our website to collect information that helps us enhance your online experience.

The cookies we use at Flare® allow our website to work, and to help us to understand what information and advertising is most useful to visitors.

## WHAT COOKIES ARE

A cookie is a text file containing information which is downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are useful because they allow websites to recognise a user's device. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. You can find more information about cookies at: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

When we refer to Cookies throughout this Policy, we intend to cover all similar devices including web beacons and log files. For more information on those additional tools, please read our Glossary.

## WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND WHY

Part of creating an enjoyable and lasting experience for our customers is to use cookies to process information in order to better understand what you want from our site.

Examples of the types of information we collect via cookies may include:

  * how many users visit the Flare® website, how often the site is visited, the pages visited on the site, click-through on the site and the total time spent on the site;
  * whether you have visited our website before or if you are a new visitor;
  * the website visited before the Flare® site;
  * your viewing preferences (e.g. layout, sizing preferences, language, etc.);
  * your purchases and orders; and
  * your username, password, browser type and IP address, so we can recognise you on future visits.



Please note that we do not collect your name or e-mail address via cookies.

In addition, cookies help us to:

  * customise your visit: we may use information from your visit to help improve your next visit to our site;
  * customise the advertising and marketing messages you receive on this site either from ourselves or from third parties. This could involve identifying website features in which you have an interest, and recommending accessories for your Flare® products. Our goal is to provide you with what you want as quickly and easily as possible; and
  * look at customer trends: we compile information from thousands of customer visits and analyse it as a whole. This kind of study focuses on identifying trends among the many visitors to our site rather than analysing information about any individual customer.



## THE TYPE OF COOKIES WE USE

When you use our website, the following categories of cookies may be set on your device:

### First-party cookies

These cookies are set by Flare®. For the most part, they are strictly necessary to enable you to move around the website and use its features.

  * Strictly necessary cookies – These cookies are set by Flare® and enable you to move about the site or to receive certain requested features, such as allowing you to place orders on the website.
  * Analytics cookies – These cookies are set by Flare® to collect statistical (aggregated and anonymous) information about the use of the website by you and other visitors. This information allows Flare® to enhance the functionality of the website.



### Third-party cookies

In addition to our use of these applications, certain third parties and affiliates may set and access cookies on your computer, and in conjunction with web beacons.

  * Strictly necessary cookies – These cookies enable useful services and functionalities, for example the online chat support.
  * Online behavioural advertising cookies – These cookies collect information about your browsing habits, product and services preferences. This information will allow Flare® and advertising networks we work with to display relevant ads in the most appropriate places on partner websites and on Flare®'s websites. For example, third parties or affiliates may administer Flare® banner advertising programs on a non-Flare® website.



How long cookies are stored on your device

The length of time cookies are stored on your machine can vary, but they generally fall into two categories: temporary or persistent.

### Temporary cookies

We use temporary session cookies on all of our secure pages to assign and store a session ID to you so that you can move uninterrupted between the areas of our site. This session ID is also used for internal reporting purposes. It is not personally identifiable to you, and this type of cookie does not leave any retrievable information on your hard drive. Most of our first party cookies are session cookies which expire when you close your internet browser.

### Persistent cookies

Our first party analytics cookies and third party cookies are persistent cookies because they are used to help us understand visitor patterns over a longer term or to provide additional functions you have requested in relation to site customisation and saved or stored content. They can be stored on your computer for 24 hours, a week, or several years, depending on the function they're helping to perform.

## HOW TO MANAGE COOKIES

If you don't want to receive certain categories of cookies on our websites, you can use the following tool to opt-out of them. Please note that we will need to set a cookie so that we can remember your choices when you next visit the website from the same browser.

At the present time it is not technically possible for us to allow you to carry your settings with you between your browsers and devices (i.e. your computer or smartphone) so you will need to change these settings independently on each browser/device you use. You will need to set these preferences every time you use a new browser or a new device.

### Strictly necessary cookies

These cookies are set by Flare® and enable you to move about the site or to receive certain requested features, such as allowing you to place orders on the website.

### Analytics cookies

These cookies are set by Flare® in order to collect statistical (aggregated and anonymous) information about the use of the website. This information allows Flare® to enhance the functionality of the website.

### Strictly necessary cookies set by third parties

These cookies enable useful services and functionalities, for example the online chat support, and are offered by Flare®'s partners.

### Online behavioural advertising cookies

These cookies are set by Flare® or by advertising partners in order to collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits, product and services preferences. This information will allow Flare® and partners to display relevant ads on partner websites and on Flare®'s websites.

In addition, you are free to manage your cookies via your web browser. You can always set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, which gives you the option to decide whether or not to accept it. You can remove cookies from your machine at any time.
