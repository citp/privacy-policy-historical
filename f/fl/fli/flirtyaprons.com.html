                <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; </li>
                <li>We provide such information to trusted businesses or persons for the sole purpose of processing personally identifying information on our behalf.

            Notification of Changes<br>
            If we decide to change our privacy policy, changes will be posted to this privacy statement, our homepage, and other places we deem conspicuous and appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. <u><strong>Flirty Aprons</strong></u> will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be notified via e-mail. Users will then be presented with a choice as to whether or not we become authorized to use their information in this different way. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users (who have opted to receive communications from <u><strong>Flirty Aprons</strong></u>), notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.<br>
            <br>
            <u><strong>Flirty Aprons</strong></u> and its affiliates maintain professional standards and have a high quality of respect to our members as well as our guest and affiliates</p>
