  * **Advertisers, Advertising Networks, and Other Third Parties:** We may share information about how you use the Services and interact with content or ads to better tailor services, products, marketing and advertising on the Services and on third-party platforms. To enable these purposes, we may share certain demographics information, user-generated content, device information and identifiers, connection and usage data, geolocation data, public and commercial information, and social media information. These third parties may use their own tracking technologies to collect or request information about you, please see our [Cookies Notice](https://web.archive.org/policies/cookies-and-tracking). 
  * **Partners:** We may share your information with third party partners. For instance, if you enter a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, we may share the information you provide for that entry with the sponsor. Depending on the partnership, we may share certain information including contact information (at your direction), identification and demographic information, transactional information, user-generated content that you provide, research and feedback, device information and identifiers, connection and usage information, public and commercial information, and social media information. We may also share your information with third parties that provide video locker services if you purchase a movie or other show to view at home. Examples of such a third party would be Movies Anywhere. Similarly, we may share your information with the providers of loyalty programs if you take an action in the Services indicating that you would like to obtain a benefit under such a program through activity on the Services.
  * **Social Networks:** We may share your information with social media platforms for example, if you click on a Facebook “like” button on the Services, the “like” may appear on your Facebook account. To control this sharing of information, please review and adjust your privacy settings for the relevant social network. Depending on your privacy settings and actions on such network, we may share contact information, identification and demographic information, user-generated content, device information and identifiers, connection and usage data, and social media information.
  * **Service Providers:** We engage vendors to perform services for business purposes on our behalf and share information with them to enable them to provide us with such services, including research and analytics, hosting, transaction and payment processing, promotion administration, fraud prevention, identity management, acquisition and other services. Service providers may use such information for their operational purposes in order to provide their services to us. 
    * **Research and Measurement Companies:** We share information about content you view on the Services with video measurement services such as Nielsen TV Ratings, as well as other analytics providers. See Your Rights and Your Choices sections for more information. 
  * **Search Engines:** You may be able to engage with other members of the Services or the public. This may make the name and photo associated with your profile and any comments or user-generated content you provide visible to other members of the Services or the general public. If the information is available to the general public, it may also be searchable by search engines. 
  * **Law Enforcement, Regulators, Anti-fraud Coalitions and Other Groups:** We share any of the categories of information we collect, as appropriate, with these third parties in order to: protect and enforce the legal rights, privacy, and safety of ourselves and our visitors; protect against possible fraud or other illegal activity; respond to requests from government and other authorities; and otherwise comply with legal process. 



###### **Other Sharing**

In the event that Fandango (or any Fandango business) is involved in a merger, acquisition, transfer of control, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets, or diligence associated with such matters, we may sell or transfer the information described in this Privacy Policy as part of that transaction.

##### 3\. LEGAL BASES FOR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

Laws other than the federal, state and local laws of the United States do not apply to our watch-at-home movie Services (e.g., FandangoNOW/M-GO) as content from those Services can be viewed only in the United States. Similarly, for our movie ticketing Services (e.g., Flixster, Fandango.com and MovieTickets.com), the only laws that shall apply are the laws of the countries in which the theaters ticketed by each respective Service are located. The information set forth below in this section is applicable only to European Users of Rotten Tomatoes. It supplements certain sections of this Privacy Policy and provides additional information that should be read together with other sections of this Privacy Policy. To the extent there is any conflict between this section and another section of this Privacy Policy, this section shall govern. 

When this policy mentions "Fandango", "we", "our" or "us", it refers to the company or companies responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (or “Data Controller”). This includes Fandango Media, LLC and Fandango’s Owners (as defined above), currently NBCUniversal, LLC and Warner Bros (please see above for further information on these companies).

The laws of some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, require companies to tell you about the legal basis for using, sharing, or disclosing your information. To the extent those laws apply, we may rely on the following legal bases: 

  * **Performance of a contract:** where use of your information is necessary to provide you with the Services under a contract, for example the terms of service.
  * **Legitimate interest:** where use of your information is necessary for our or others’ legitimate interests and where the use is not outweighed by your rights and interests. Below are some examples of such interests: 
    * providing the Services 
    * improving the Services and developing new ones
    * recognizing and better understanding our users, including across platforms 
    * conducting security and fraud prevention activities
    * marketing and promoting our content and services
    * building and managing business relationships
    * conducting compliance and risk management activities 
    * providing and managing access to our systems
  * **Legal obligation:** where use of your information is necessary to comply with laws and regulations such as those relating to anti-bribery and corruption and anti-money-laundering, complying with requests from government bodies or courts, or responding to litigation.
  * **With consent:** we may ask for your consent to process your information in a certain way. Where we rely on this basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time – please see the Your Rights and Your Choices sections below to do this. 



###### How Long We Keep Your Information

We will keep your information only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes described above, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. The retention period that applies to your information may vary depending on the Services you use and how you interact with them. 

##### 4\. CHILDREN

The Services are not designed or intended for use by children under 13, and thus if you are under 13 we ask that you do not use the Services or provide us with any information. If we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information then we will, to the extent required by law, delete such information from our records. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child under 13 has provided us with information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@fandango.com](mailto:privacy@fandango.com).

##### 5\. YOUR RIGHTS 

Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights with respect to your information. For example, under local laws, you may be able to ask us to:

  * provide access to certain information we hold about you, in some cases in a portable format, if technically feasible 
  * update or correct your information 
  * delete certain information 
  * restrict the use of your information



We will respond within the time period prescribed by applicable law. Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations. 

Some Services can be provided only if we have your information, therefore deletion of your information will result in termination of such Services. 

We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, including authenticating you through the email address we have on file. We may require further documentation such as a password and user ID before granting access to your information.

###### Mobile App and Connected Devices

Depending on the device you use, you may be able to manage your advertising and location preferences through your device settings and as outlined in our [Cookies Notice](https://web.archive.org/policies/cookies-and-tracking). Many operating systems provide their own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to manage personalized in-application advertisements. You should review your device manufacturer’s support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems for more detail on how to manage such preferences.

You may opt out of location data collection on our mobile app(s) by managing your location preferences in the "My Account" section of that app, or by disabling the GPS services for that app on your mobile device.

Please include as much detail as possible when you make a request.

You can stop all collection of information by a mobile app by uninstalling the app. 

###### Third-Party Online Services

The Services may contain links to third party services.

We do not control those third parties’ policies or practices. Where Fandango collects personal information on a co-branded website or service, we will provide a link to our privacy policy as appropriate. In some circumstances, we may host some websites on behalf of others and those entities may place or permit the placement of cookies and other tracking technology. We are not responsible for these tracking practices.

###### Google Maps

If you use Google Maps / Google Earth as part of the Services, you agree to comply with the Google Maps / Google Earth Additional Terms of Service (including the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)).

##### 7\. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION

We maintain organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect the information we collect and use. These safeguards vary depending upon a variety of factors including the sensitivity of the information we collect and use. Despite all reasonable practices, no security method is infallible. 

##### 8\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS 

Fandango is a global company and has its headquarters in the United States. We may transfer your information to those described in this Privacy Policy outside of your country of residence, including in the United States and other countries. This is necessary to provide the Services and for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Data privacy laws vary from country to country and they may not be equivalent to, or as protective as, the laws in your home country.

By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use.
