	</div>	

	<p class="space_big">We know you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. <strong>By visiting Flirt 4 Free, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</strong></p>
	
	<div class="space_big">
		<h3>What Personal Information About Customers Does Flirt 4 Free Gather?</h3>
			
		<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at Flirt 4 Free. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> We receive and store any 
		information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way.  You can choose not 
		to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of 
		many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as 
		responding to your requests, customizing future visits for you, improving our services, 
		and communicating with you.</p>
		
		<p>You provide most such information when you buy, or participate in a contest or 
		questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide 
		information when you purchase a product; join a site; provide information to customer 
		support regarding an account (you might have more than one if you have used more than 
		one e-mail address, user name, or credit card when shopping with us); communicate 
		with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; or complete a questionnaire or a contest 
		entry form. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information 
		as your name, address, and phone number; credit card information; e-mail addresses; 
		birth date and content of e-mails to us.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store 
		certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many 
		Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your 
		Web browser accesses Flirt 4 Free.  A number of companies offer utilities designed 
		to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Due to the sensitive issues involving 
		access to adult content by children, we do not permit access to our sites from 
		these anonymous services.</p>
		
		<p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol 
		(IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login name; e-mail 
		address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and 
		version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform 
		Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including 
		date and time; cookie number; products you viewed; services you visited; your 
		customer service history, and phone number used to call our 800 number.</p>
		
		<p><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong> To help us make e-mails 
		more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail 
		from Flirt 4 Free. We also compare our customer list to lists 
		received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages 
		to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, 
		simply send email to <a href="mailto:remove@vs.com">remove@vs.com</a>.</p>
	</div>	
	
	<div class="space_big">		
		<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
		
		<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard 
		drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser 
		and to provide features such as "What's New".</p>
		
		<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
		your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when 
		you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies 
		allow you to take full advantage of some of VideoSecrets' coolest services, and 
		we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p> 
	</div>	
	
	<div class="space_big">
		<h3>Does Flirt 4 Free Share the Information It Receives?</h3>
			
		<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in 
		the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only with the 
		subsidiaries Flirt 4 Free, controls and as described below.</p>
	
		
		<p><strong>Agents:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals 
		to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments 
		in real time, sending e-mail notifications or updates, and providing customer 
		service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, 
		but they do not have our authorization to use it for other purposes.</p>
	
	
		<p><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong> Sometimes we send offers to 
		selected groups of VideoSecrets customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do 
		this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to 
		receive such offers, please send email 
		to <a href="mailto:remove@vs.com">remove@vs.com</a></p>
			
		<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our 
		business, we might sell or buy sites or assets. In such transactions, customer 
		information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely 
		event that VideoSecrets, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer 
		information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</p>
	
		<p><strong>Protection of Flirt 4 Free and Others:</strong> We 
		release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate 
		to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; 
		or protect the rights, property, or safety of Flirt 4 Free, our users, or 
		others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for 
		fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
	
		<p><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Other than as set out above, you 
		will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will 
		have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p> 
	</div>	

	<div class="space_big">
		<h3>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h3>
		
		<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using 
		Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.</p>
	
		<p>We reveal only the last eight digits of your credit card numbers when confirming 
		an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate 
		credit card company during order processing.</p>
	
		<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your account 
		passwords and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared 
		computer.</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="space_big">
		<h3>What Information Can I Access?</h3>
			
		<p>Flirt 4 Free gives you access to the following information about you 
		for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 
		This list will change as our Web site evolves.</p>
		
		<p><a href="/my-account/">Your Account</a></p>
	</div>
		
	<div class="space_big">	
		<h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
		
		<p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even 
		though it might be needed to make a purchase.</p> 
		
		<p>You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the 
		"What Information Can I Access?" section above. When you update information, we 
		usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</p> 
	
		<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please send 
		email to <a href="mailto:remove@vs.com">remove@vs.com</a> (If you 
		do not want to receive Terms and Conditions and other legal notices from us, 
		such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of 
		Flirt 4 Free, and it is your responsibility to review them 
		for changes.)</p> 
			
		<p>The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
		your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when 
		you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you 
		will not be able to use such services as Flirt 4 Free and other 
		live shows if you do not use cookies.</p>
	
		<p>In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about 
		online privacy on its own Web site, Site Seeing on the 
		Internet <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/online/sitesee/index.html</a>.</p>

		not permit access to any of our sites or pages by individuals under the age of 18 years.  If
