We only collect, process, and use personal data and data provided by you - unless already permitted by legal authorization -with your consent. If your consent is provided electronically within the scope of our website, we comply with statutory obligations to provide information.

These service providers only have access to your personal data to the extent which is necessary for the completion of their tasks.

We process the data collected from you according to the German Data Protection Act. All employees are obliged and have been advised to maintain data confidentiality and privacy obligations. When submitting payments, the transfer of your data is protected by SSL encryption technology.

### 8\. Facebook Social Plugins

This website uses Social Plugins ("Plugins") provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”). The plugins can be identified by the Facebook logos (white "f" on a blue background or a "thumbs up" icon) or the extension “Facebook Social Plugin” (<http://developers.facebook.com/plugins>).

When a user visits a page of website that contains a social plugin, the browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser which embeds the latter into the website. We accordingly have no influence over the scope of the data that Facebook acquires using this plugin and therefore draw your attention to the information we have available in this respect (<http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=17512>).

The embedded plugins let Facebook know that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or entering a comment, your browser will send the corresponding information directly to Facebook, at which point it will be saved. If you are not a member of Facebook, Facebook may still acquire and store your IP address. Facebook ensures that, in Germany, the IP address will only be stored anonymously.

For the information on the purpose and scope of data collection and handling by Facebook, as well as your rights in this respect and configuration options regarding the protection of your personal sphere, please visit Facebook's data use policy (<http://www.facebook.com/policy.php>).

If you are a Facebook member and do not want Facebook to collect data concerning your visit to our website and do not want this linked to your Facebook membership data, please log out of Facebook before visiting our website.

You can also block Facebook Social Plugins by using add-ons for your browser, such as “Facebook Blocker” (<http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker>).

### 9\. Twitter

This website uses the service functions for Twitter (<https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons>). These functions are provided by Twitter, Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA, and can be identified by terms such as “Twitter” or “Tweet” combined with a stylized blue bird. A Twitter button enables you to either share a posting or page of this website on Twitter or to follow us on Twitter.

When a user visits a page of website that contains this plugin, the browser establishes a direct connection to Twitter servers. Twitter directly transfers the Twitter button contents to your browser. Thus, we have no influence on the data acquired by Twitter using the plugin and therefore draw your attention to the information we have available in this respect. According to Twitter, only the user's IP address and the URL of the relevant website in connection with the button are transmitted and only used for the purposes represented by the button. For further information, please follow this link to Twitter's privacy policy (<http://twitter.com/privacy>).

### 10\. Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how you use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will be generally transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USA.

If the IP anonymizer is activated on this website, your IP address will be truncated within the area of Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the whole IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. The IP anonymizer is activated on this website. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators, and providing them with other services relating to website activity and internet usage.

Google will never link your IP address sent by your browser to other Google data. You can configure your browser software to block the installation of cookies on your computer; however, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by the cookie which relates to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) from being recorded at Google, as well as the handling of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link (<http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de>).

### 11\. Google AdSense

This website uses Google AdSense, a service for integrating advertisements by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google AdSense uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how you use the site. Google AdSense also uses "web beacons" (invisible graphics). These web beacons make it possible to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on these pages of our website.

The information generated by the cookie and the web beacon about your use of the website (including the user's IP address) and the delivery of advertising formats will be generally transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USA. Google may transfer this information to contractual partners. However, at no point will Google link your IP address with other stored data.
