Many of the advertisements you see on the TripAdvisor family of sites are served by a company in the TripAdvisor group or one of its service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your interests.

  * Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.



Your browser will have the option to prevent websites using cookies (your browser's help screen or manual will tell you how to do this), but please note that this may reduce the functionality of our site and other websites.

Like all websites, our servers automatically record "log files" containing information about the volume and characteristics of our Website traffic e.g. IP address, numbers of pages viewed, length of time spent on site. We use log files to build pictures of how our site is used, which help us to monitor and improve the service. We cannot identify you from your log files alone.

We will respond to your request within one month, but have the right to extend this period with two months.

  7. **How  we protect your personal data**



We want you to feel confident about using the Website to plan and book your holiday rental, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no website can guarantee security, we have implemented and maintain appropriate physical, administrative, technical, and organisational measures to protect the personal data you provide us against unauthorised or unlawful access, use or disclosure, and against accidental loss, damage, alteration or destruction.

For example, only authorised employees are permitted to access personal data, and they only may do so for permitted business functions.

Our Website may include links to third party websites, plug-ins and applications. If you access other websites from the links provided on our Website, the operators of those websites may collect information from you, which will be used by them in accordance with their Privacy Policy, which may differ from our Privacy Policy.

**Marketing**

Queremos que le resulte fácil aprovecharse de las oportunidades relacionadas con los viajes que se encuentran disponibles en nuestro Sitio web. Uno de los métodos que utilizamos para conseguirlo es el envío de mensajes de correo electrónico que contienen información sobre sus intereses relacionados con los viajes. Creemos que estos mensajes de correo electrónico le proporcionarán información útil sobre las ofertas especiales relacionadas con los viajes disponibles en nuestros sitios.

Le enviaremos mensajes promocionales si ha dado su consentimiento, si los ha solicitado o si ha adquirido nuestros servicios y no ha cancelado la suscripción para recibir mensajes promocionales.

Cada vez que recibe por correo electrónico un mensaje de esta clase, podrá indicarnos si no desea recibirlos más, o rechazar las notificaciones automáticas en la aplicación o modificar los ajustes de su dispositivo móvil con este fin. Podrá cancelar la suscripción para recibir comunicaciones promocionales en cualquier momento haciendo clic en el enlace de cancelación de la suscripción que encontrará al final de cada mensaje que le enviemos.

Tenga en cuenta que puede que le sigamos enviando comunicaciones de servicios, como mensajes administrativos acerca de su cuenta o sobre transacciones relacionadas con alguna de sus reservas o su cuenta de Niumba. No es posible darse de baja de estas comunicaciones de servicio.

  3. **Con quién compartimos sus datos personales**



Es posible que Niumba comparta su información con otras partes, como empresas de otros grupos y terceros que se detallan a continuación.

Si estamos obligados por ley a hacerlo, compartiremos los datos personales para proteger a nuestros clientes y el sitio, así como nuestra empresa, nuestros derechos y nuestros bienes.

  * _Proveedores_ : entre los que se incluyen los gestores o propietarios de alojamientos que atiendan reservas de viajes y los proveedores externos que presten otros servicios, como por ejemplo, de fotografía (si dichos servicios están disponibles ocasionalmente y desea hacer uso de ellos). En el Sitio web y los sitios afiliados, todos los productos y servicios que prestados por terceros se describen como tales. Tenga en cuenta que también es posible que estos proveedores se pongan en contacto con usted, si es necesario, para obtener información adicional sobre usted o sus planes de viaje, para facilitarle las reservas de viajes o para otros fines de acuerdo con las prácticas que se describen en sus políticas de privacidad y sus condiciones de uso.

Los proveedores terceros pueden recopilar y consultar únicamente la información necesaria para realizar sus funciones, pero no tienen permiso para compartirla ni utilizarla con ningún otro propósito.
  * _Socios comerciales_ con quienes podemos ofrecer productos o servicios, o cuyos productos o servicios creamos que pueden serle de interés. Puede saber si hay algún tercero está involucrado en un producto o servicio que haya solicitado porque su nombre aparecerá junto al nuestro o separado.

Tenga en cuenta que no tenemos control sobre las prácticas de privacidad de estos socios empresariales terceros.
  * _Empresas de nuestra familia corporativa._ Es posible que compartamos sus datos personales con el grupo de empresas de TripAdvisor, así como con nuestras empresas matrices y nuestros sitios web y nuestras empresas afiliadas corporativas nacionales e internacionales.

En la medida en que nuestra empresa matriz y nuestras empresas afiliadas corporativas tengan acceso a sus datos personales, seguirán unas prácticas al menos tan restrictivas como las prácticas descritas en la presente Política de privacidad. Asimismo, cumplirán con las leyes aplicables que rijan la transmisión de comunicaciones promocionales y, como mínimo, en todos los mensajes de correo electrónico comerciales que le envíen le ofrecerán la opción de elegir si desea dejar de recibir tales mensajes en el futuro.

Datos recopilados para ofrecerle publicidad relevante

Datos recopilados por socios comerciales y redes publicitarias para divulgar publicidad pertinente

En su navegador, se le ofrece la posibilidad de evitar que los sitios web utilicen cookies (en el manual del navegador o en la ayuda en pantalla encontrará cómo hacerlo), pero le rogamos que tenga en cuenta que, si lo hace, puede verse afectado el funcionamiento de nuestro sitio y de otros sitios web.

Al igual que ocurre con todos los sitios web, nuestros servidores guardan automáticamente “archivos de registro” que contienen información sobre el volumen y las características del tráfico de nuestro Sitio web como, por ejemplo, la dirección IP, el número de páginas visitadas y el tiempo empleado en el sitio. Nos valemos de los archivos de registro para hacernos una idea de cómo se utiliza nuestro sitio, lo que nos ayuda a supervisar y mejorar el servicio. No podemos identificarle únicamente a partir de sus archivos de registro.

  6. **Sus derechos**

  7. **Cómo protegemos sus datos personales**



Queremos que sienta confianza cuando utilice el Sitio web para planificar y reservar su alquiler vacacional, por eso nos comprometemos a proteger la información que recopilemos. Aunque ningún sitio web puede garantizar su seguridad, hemos implementado y mantenemos medidas físicas, administrativas, técnicas y organizativas apropiadas para proteger los datos personales que nos proporciona frente al acceso no autorizado o ilegal y la revelación de información y contra pérdidas, daños, alteraciones o destrucciones accidentales.

Por ejemplo, solo los empleados autorizados podrán acceder a sus datos personales y solo podrán hacerlo para llevar a cabo funciones empresariales permitidas.

  8. **Enlaces externos**



Es posible que nuestro Sitio web incluya enlaces a sitios web, complementos y aplicaciones de terceros. Si accede a otros sitios web desde los enlaces que se proporcionan en nuestro Sitio web, es posible que los operadores de dichos sitios web recopilen información sobre usted y que la utilicen de acuerdo con su política de privacidad, que puede diferir de la nuestra. No controlamos los sitios web de terceros y le recomendamos que examine las declaraciones de privacidad publicadas en esos otros sitios web para conocer sus procedimientos a la hora de recopilar, utilizar y divulgar datos personales.

  9. **Transferencias internacionales**



Sus datos personales podrán transferirse a otros países para los fines descritos en esta Política de privacidad. Cuando transferimos sus datos personales al Espacio Económico Europeo, adoptamos las precauciones siguientes para garantizar que sus datos personales se protegen de forma adecuada.

Siempre que almacenemos o transfiramos sus datos personales fuera del Espacio Económico Europeo, lo haremos de conformidad con la ley vigente y nos aseguraremos de que recibe el mismo nivel de protección mediante la implantación de medidas de seguridad adecuadas. Las transferencias de datos personales se realizarán:

  * a países reconocidos por la Comisión Europea por proporcionar un nivel adecuado de protección;
  * A países que no ofrecen una protección adecuada pero cuyas transferencias se rigen por las cláusulas contractuales normalizadas de la Comisión Europea o por la adopción de otras soluciones de transferencias transfronterizas apropiadas para ofrecer un nivel de protección idóneo.



Al utilizar nuestros servicios, usted acepta que su información se pueda transferir a nuestras instalaciones y a las de aquellos terceros con los que la compartimos, tal como se describe en la presente Política de privacidad.
