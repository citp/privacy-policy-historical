### _When Fliqz Discloses Information:_

**Fliqz does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your express consent.**  
To provide web site hosting, maintenance and security, fulfill orders, offer certain functionality, improve our site, and to create new site features, we may disclose User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use appropriate confidentiality measures.  
Fliqz may share automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Fliqz Sites.  
Fliqz may disclose User information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant. We may make such disclosures without providing Users notice, in some cases.  
Fliqz reserves the right to disclose User information that is necessary to enforce our Terms of Use; take precautions against liability; protect Users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Fliqz Sites; and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Fliqz, our members, or others.

### _Your Choices:_

You may, of course, decline to share personally identifiable information with Fliqz, in which case you will not be able to upload videos or media to the Fliqz Sites. You may update, correct, or delete your member information and email subscription preferences at any time by going to the account section of the Fliqz Sites.   
To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.

### _Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:_

Fliqz allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Fliqz Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Fliqz Sites. They automatically receive your IP Address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.  
Fliqz does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Fliqz to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.  
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. Fliqz's Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

### _Our Commitment to Data Security:_

Fliqz uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Fliqz and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Fliqz makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.  
If Fliqz learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Fliqz may post a notice on the Fliqz Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at [privacy@fliqz.com](mailto:privacy@fliqz.com).

For that reason, Fliqz does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the Fliqz Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE FLIQZ SITES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. If Fliqz learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected on Fliqz without verifiable parental consent, then Fliqz will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
