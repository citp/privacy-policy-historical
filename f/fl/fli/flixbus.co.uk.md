## 9\. Use of cookies

When you visit our website, information is stored in the form of a cookie (small text files stored on your browser). Information about your use of the website is saved there (identification ID, visit date, etc.). With the use of cookies, we facilitate the use of our online offer through various service functions (such as the recognition of previous visits) and consequently can better adapt the internet offer to your needs. You can stop the storage of cookies and delete existing cookies by making the appropriate changes to your browser settings. The help function of most browsers tells you how to change these settings. If you do not accept cookies, this may affect the service functions of the internet offer. We therefore recommend that the cookie function be left switched on.

In addition, we use third-party cookies for retargeting and remarketing technologies to optimise our web offerings as well as interest-based marketing purposes. The stored surfing behaviour is analysed using an algorithm, so that targeted interest-related product recommendations in the form of advertising banners or advertisements can then be displayed on third party websites. Without the express consent of the person concerned, the pseudonymised user profiles will not be combined with the personal data of the user of the pseudonym.

Comprehensive information about how to accomplish this on a wide variety of browsers can be found on the following websites: [youronlinechoices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/), [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) and/or [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/). You can also find information there about how to delete cookies from your computer as well as general information about cookies.

### 9.1 Google AdWords

To optimise our web offerings as well as for product recommendations, we use the technology provided by Google Limited („Google“) (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, „Google“) to create pseudonymised user profiles about the surfing behaviour of the website visitors for marketing purposes. For this purpose, cookies may be used, which make it possible to recognise an internet browser on a return visit. The stored surfing behaviour is analysed using an algorithm, so that targeted interest-related product recommendations in the form of advertising banners or advertisements can then be displayed on third party websites. Without the express consent of the person concerned, the pseudonymised user profile will not be combined with the personal data of the user of the pseudonym. The creation of pseudonymised user profiles for interest-based advertising/ad preferences can be refused at any time by [visiting the https://www.google.com/settings/ads page](https://www.google.de/settings/ads).
