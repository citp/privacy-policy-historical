# Privacy Policy → FlixBus

## Privacy Policy and Consent to Data Usage

FlixMobility GmbH’s Internet portal and the booking portal integrated therein (hereinafter jointly referred to as “website”) are operated by FlixMobility GmbH, Birketweg 33, 80639 Munich, Germany (hereinafter “FlixMobility” or “we”). Protecting your personal data is very important to us. Data protection is therefore a high priority for FlixMobility GmbH. We strictly comply with the legal provisions of the Data Protection Act and the Telemedia Act when collecting, processing and using your data.

By agreeing to the following data privacy policy, you consent to the collection, processing and use of your data by FlixMobility GmbH in accordance with data protection laws and the provisions set out in the following. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future.

## Collection, Processing and Use of Personal Data

Personal data are all information relating to a specific or identifiable person. This includes, for example, your name, your telephone number, or your postal and email addresses.

You can generally use our website without providing personal data.

In order to process ticket orders and deliver transportation services we collect, store and process your first and last name and your mobile number. The following additional data may be required for necessary payment processing: to pay for a booked trip by credit card, FlixMobility requires your full name, your email address and your credit card data. FlixMobility will not store your credit card number; it is transmitted directly to the payment processing service. When paying for a booked trip via direct debit, FlixMobility records your full name, address, date of birth, email address and the details of your current account. If payment is made by instant bank transfer or PayPal no payment data are stored.

The data required for contract processing and the provision of transportation services are only forwarded to the coach companies delivering these services and to other third parties (e.g. service providers for IT, transportation, customer service and payment processing) to the extent necessary for registering and processing ticket sales. In justified cases (e.g. damage to buses) we reserve the right to pass on customer data to the transporting coach partner. The forwarded data may be used by our service providers exclusively to fulfil their contractual obligations and not for other purposes.

FlixMobility will not share personal data with third parties for marketing purposes.

## Credit Check During Direct Debit Payment via Billpay

In addition, Billpay may use tools from third parties in order to detect and prevent cases of fraud.

## User Login/Customer Account

You have the option of setting up a personal customer account with us. In the password-protected area of the customer account you can easily manage your bookings and save your data for future trips.

The fields marked as required (*), which include personal data, are only used to implement and process your user account. Initially only your email address is required. We use it to verify your identity. During registration you can optionally also enter your name, your address, and, if you wish, your bank account data.

These data are used both for creating invoices and to automatically pre-fill your information during future bookings. In addition, you can also voluntarily save your mobile number so we can contact you in the event of a delay or change to your trip’s route.

If you have agreed to this, the “Stay Signed In” function saves so-called persistent cookies on your end device; these are used to automatically sign you in during subsequent visits to our website. This function is not available if you have deactivated saving of such cookies in your browser settings.

You can update or delete your customer account – and thus also your saved personal data – at any time in your personal customer account.

Due to legally mandated data retention periods, personal data required for contract performance are not deleted when you delete your account.

## Newsletter

If you subscribe to our newsletter, your e-mail address is used to communicate with you and to send you, for example, service messages, system messages, emails confirming your registration, to transmit user account information, information about your tickets and itineraries or your travel profiles, until such time as you unsubscribe from the newsletter. In addition, we use your email address for our own advertising purposes. You can unsubscribe at any time.

If we receive your email address in connection with a booking or trip and you have not opted out, we reserve the right to regularly send you offers for products similar to those you have previously purchased from us. You can opt out of this use of your email address at any time by emailing [unsubscribe@flixbus.com](mailto:unsubscribe@flixbus.com) or by using the opt-out link in the advertising email, without incurring any costs beyond the cost of transmission according to the base rates.

## Data Security

We employ technical and organisational measures to protect the privacy of users of our website and the connected systems. To ensure the secure transmission of personal data, we use the SSL 3.0 encryption protocol (the underlying encryption scheme used for the Public Key Infrastructure is RSA-2048). This method is successfully used throughout the World Wide Web. All personal data (name, address, payment information, etc.) are encrypted and thus transmitted safely on the Internet. A symbol (closed padlock) in the bottom bar of your browser window indicates that you are in a secure area.

## Cookies

FlixMobility uses so-called cookies on its website. Cookies are small files that are stored on your drive and store certain settings and data for exchange with our system through your browser. Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, i.e. after you close your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your device and allow us or our partners to recognise your browser the next time you visit the website (persistent cookies). Storing this information helps us to customise our website for you and makes it easier to use by, for example, saving certain data entries from you so that you do not have to constantly repeat them. Your browser offers settings to restrict the use or deletion of cookies; the help function on most browsers will tell you how to make these settings. Not accepting cookies may affect the service functionalities of our website.

## Right to Information and Right of Appeal

Under the Federal Privacy Act, you have the right to request information about your stored data free of charge, and the right to demand the rectification, deletion or blocking of these data. For more information or to revoke your consent to data storage as outlined above, please contact: FlixMobility GmbH, Birketweg 33, 80639 Munich, Germany or [datenschutz@flixbus.de](http://datenschutz@flixbus.de/).

## Google Remarketing

In order to optimise our website and make product recommendations we use the technologies of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; “Google”) to create pseudonymous user profiles on the browsing behaviour of visitors to our website for marketing purposes.  For this purpose cookies may be used that allow an Internet browser to be recognised during a subsequent visit. Your stored browsing behaviour is analysed based on an algorithm that makes it possible to subsequently display targeted interest-based product recommendations on third-party websites in the form of advertising banners or advertisements. The pseudonymous user profiles are not merged with personal data of the pseudonym bearer without separate explicit consent by the person in question. You can opt out of pseudonymous user profiles for interest-based promotion/advertising specifications at any time by accessing the website <https://www.google.de/settings/ads>.

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer, to help analyse how you use the site.

This means that IP addresses are processed only in a shortened form and in member states of the European Union or other signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area to prevent direct correlation with an individual person. Only in exceptional cases is the complete IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website and Internet use to the website owner. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. You can prevent your browser from storing these cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser software; we would however like to point out that you may not be able to use all the features of this website if you do so.

An overview of Facebook plugins and their appearance is available here: <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins>.  
When you visit a page of our web presence that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers.

If you interact with the plugins, for example by pressing the "Like" button or commenting, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information will also be published on your Facebook profile and shown to your Facebook friends.  
Facebook can use this information for purposes of advertising, market research and tailored design of Facebook pages. To this end, Facebook creates usage, interest and relationship profiles, e.g. in order to evaluate your use of our website with regard to advertisements appearing on your Facebook page, to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website and to provide other services related to the use of Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to assign the data collected via our web presence to your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before you visit our site.  
Purpose and scope of data collection, the further processing and use of these data by Facebook, your rights in this respect and the available settings for protecting your privacy can be found in Facebook’s privacy policies: http://www.facebook.com/policy.php.
