# Buy and sell web sites — Flippa

## What We Collect

We save the details you provide to us in your account profile, including your email address, phone numbers, physical address – you get the idea. The majority of this information is optional, but whatever you provide is safe with us. We will publicly display the country you are in by default, though you have the option to disable this behavior within your account profile. We won’t disclose private information to anyone unless we’re forced to by law.

We also collect the following usage statistics at an aggregate level:

  * Your IP address
  * Your browser version and its capabilites
  * Your operating system
  * The date and time of your visit



## What We Do With It

Aside from the obvious uses of your details to enable the functionality of the Flippa site, we use the information we collect to:

  * Improve website and system administration
  * Conduct research and development
  * Complete anonymous traffic analysis, via [Google Analytics](http://google.com/analytics)
  * Provide statistics to advertisers in the form of aggregated data



This information is kept on secure dedicated servers within the Flippa offices, and with trusted third party hosting providers.

The information collected during the registration process for Flippa may be used to:

  * Contact members
  * Customize content to match your preferences
  * Display member status
  * Display the date of a member’s last visit



The information we collect in this process can also be used to prevent suspended users from reregistering under a different username. We might also send cookies to your browser to enable automatic logins when you visit in future, as well as for content customization. That’s right – this little site is more complicated than it looks!

If you purchase products from Flippa, we’ll keep your contact information and a transaction history. We might use your contact details to keep you informed of the status of your order, as well as to let you know about Flippa products and services.

Feeling nervous? Don’t be! The data we collect about you will only be used by us and our agents. Flippa hereby reserves the right to transfer any data collected in the event of an acquisition, full or partial, of the company or its assets.

If you have any questions about our privacy policies, or you need help to opt out of our email lists, let us know.

## Spam?

No way! You’re a Flippa member! We’re not about to start bombarding you with annoying promotional offers (though we may send you the occasional email if you ask us to). And we’ll never sell your email addresses or personal details to advertisers, scammers, spammers, or other shifty parties. Creampuff, our boisterous, protective Doberman pinscher, usually takes care of those guys for us anyway.

Oh, don’t forget that you can control which emails you receive from us through your Account Preferences. Just log in, access the Preferences page, and make your changes.
