# Privacy Policy ✈ FlightAware

Thank you for visiting FlightAware. FlightAware is committed to honoring the privacy of our members and visitors. 

This Privacy Policy is applicable to FlightAware, LLC and its respective subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “FlightAware,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). We operate [flightaware.com](https://web.archive.org/) and [discussions.flightaware.com](https://discussions.flightaware.com/) (the “Websites”). This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect about you when you use our products or services. This policy also explains your choices about how we use information about you. Your choices include how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you. **If you do not agree with this policy, then do not access or use our services or interact with any other aspect of our business.**

This Privacy Policy is subject to any agreements, including the Terms and Conditions that govern your use of the Services. This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the means used to access or provide information through the Services.

“Account Information” means Personal Information that we may collect during registration for a Service that we provide or the purchase of a product, including names, e-mail addresses, e-mail preferences, account passwords, mailing addresses, and billing addresses. In cases where service subscriptions relate to aeronautical usage, we will also request information about the aircraft, including the registration number, country of registry, manufacturer, model and serial/fuselage/airframe number of the aircraft.

“Anonymous Information” means information that we do not link to Personal Information and does not enable contact with any identifiable person.

“Data Protection Laws” means laws relating to data protection, privacy, and/or information security, including all such laws governing use of Personal Information.

“Personal Information” is any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number, job title, job industry, company/organization name, and any other information you voluntarily provide or any other non-public information that we associate with your contact information and that can identify you as an individual.

By using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy. FlightAware provides the Services principally from the United States, but may also provide the Services in other jurisdictions, as necessary. Be advised that, through your use of our Services, which are governed by United States law and applicable Data Protection Laws of other jurisdictions, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms and Conditions, you are transferring your Personal Information to the United States (or other jurisdictions as necessary for us to provide the Services), and you consent to that transfer.

Additionally, you acknowledge by your use of our Services that you understand your Personal Information may be processed in countries (including the United States) where Data Protection Laws may be different or less stringent than in your home jurisdiction.

Finally, you acknowledge that your Personal Information may become accessible as permitted by law in the United States, including to law enforcement and/or national security authorities.

We employ reasonable physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of your Personal Information, whether stored electronically or in paper format. Information is maintained in secure facilities, protected from unauthorized access, and retained only as long as is reasonably required. Electronic files are backed up for redundancy and password-protected to ensure access only by authorized employees. We encrypt Personal Information where we deem appropriate, and we periodically test, assess, and evaluate the effectiveness of our safeguards.

We collect information about you when you input it into the services we provide or otherwise provide it directly to us.

  * **Account and Profile Information:** We collect information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for or make purchases. 
  * **Content you provide through our products:** You may provide content through our products, such as "Squawk" posts, comments on "Squawks," discussion forum posts, photos, or comments on photos. The content includes any information about you that you may choose to include. Content also includes the files and links you upload. 
  * **Information you provide through our support channels:** You may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing or questions about our services. 
  * **Payment Information** We collect certain payment and billing information when you register for certain paid services. 



This information lets us provide personalized services and communicate separately with you. We also use aggregated information about the use of our services to evaluate our users' preferences and improve our products. In addition, depending on the Services used, we may collect flying preference information, including the type of aircraft on which FlightAware products or Services are provided, and passenger-specific details, including departure and arrival locations.

When you contact us to inquire about certain products or Services, you must provide your certain Personal Information, including your name, email address, phone number, and other information necessary for us to respond to your inquiry. Likewise, when you leave us feedback, we collect any information that is contained in your feedback. When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, fax, or letter, we will collect your address, fax number, or e-mail address and any Personal Information contained in the e-mail, fax, or letter you send us.

We collect information about you when you use our services, including browsing our websites and taking certain actions within the Services.

  * **Your use of our products:** We keep track of certain information about you when you visit and interact with any of our products. This information includes what features you use. 
  * **Device and Connection Information:** We collect information about the device(s) that you use to access our products. We also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better experience. How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the products. 
  * **Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:** FlightAware and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different products and devices. 



Like most web sites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a continuous connection. Cookies let us remember information about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within our service without reintroducing yourself. Web browsers let you easily see and control cookies. FlightAware and its advertisers may also use cookies to determine on which advertisements users have seen and how users responded to them. Similarly, FlightAware and its advertisers may use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous advertising metrics and to deliver cookies related to such advertisements.

Cookies, web beacons and similar tools allow us, our service providers, and other third parties to identify your device, track your interactions with other websites, and track activity over time and across websites by storing information locally on your device. We use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer or device until you delete them). If you register for a Service provided by us, we may include web beacons with the content and ads that we deliver to you as a part of that service, which we use to collect information regarding your interaction with such content and ads. 

The information that these tools collect include your internet protocol address, unique device identification information, regional and language settings, browser type, and operating system, the network used to access our Website, and information about your use of our Website (such as how you navigate and move around the Website). Depending on applicable Data Protection Laws, this information may be considered Personal Information.

We may receive Personal Information about you from other third-party sources, including from other service users, our service providers, analytics providers (including Google Analytics), and our business partners. We may also receive data from third party services and from our business and channel partners. Other users of our products may provide information about you when they submit content through the products. For example, you may be mentioned by someone else on a "Squawk" comment or discussion forum post. Such information may include demographic information, itinerary details, dietary preferences, browsing preferences, language preferences, and other personal preferences. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.

To the extent applicable under Data Protection Laws, we process Personal Information for, or based on, one or more of the following legal bases:

  * **Performance of a Contract.** We may use Personal Information to enter into, or perform under, an agreement between us, including: to complete a purchase; process payment; ship or provide goods or Services; and provide customer support. 
  * **Legitimate Interests.** We may use Personal Information for our legitimate interests to the extent it does not infringe on any data subject’s fundamental rights and freedoms, including: improve our Services; providing information about our products and/or Services; to the extent necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security; and for administrative, fraud detection, and legal compliance purposes. 
  * **Compliance with Legal Obligations and Protection of Individuals.** We may use Personal Information to comply with the law and our legal obligations, as well as to protect you and other individuals from certain harms. 
  * **Your Consent.** From time to time, and as required by applicable Data Protection Laws, we may seek your consent to collect and process your Personal Information, as well as communicate with you to provide information that may be useful or interesting.

  * **To communicate with you:** We use your contact information to send transactional communications via e-mail and within our products, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We may also use your information to in keeping records of our relationship designed to facilitate timely and accurate invoicing and to administer our billing and accounting systems; and to answer billing, account, or technical inquiries from you. Depending on your settings, we may send you e-mail notifications of certain events, e.g., flight tracking event notifications. You may opt-out of communications via the account preference setting in your profile or via "unsubscribe" links in specific e-mails. 
  * **For safety and security:** We use information about you and your use of our products to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of FlightAware policies.

You have a variety of legal rights regarding the collection and processing of your Personal Information. You may exercise these rights, to the extent they apply to you under applicable Data Protection Laws, by contacting us as provided in the section, [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/about/contact).

You may request deletion of your Account Information or Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Personal Information, we will delete it from our active databases but the information may remain in our archives or disaster recovery systems.

Note, however, that we may request certain reasonable, additional information (that may include Personal Information) to help us authenticate your request and/or to clarify or understand the scope of such requests. These rights vary depending on applicable Data Protection Law, but may include:

  * The right to know whether, and for what purposes, we process Personal Information about you;
  * The right to be informed about the Personal Information we collect and/or process about you;
  * The right to learn the source of Personal Information about you that we process, and whether we obtain that Personal Information from a source other than you.

  * The right to know with whom we have shared Personal Information about you, for what purpose, and what Personal Information has been shared (including whether Personal Information was disclosed to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes);

  * The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority located in the jurisdiction of your habitual residence, place of work, or where an alleged violation of law occurred.



For additional information about specific legal rights, please reference the following sections: Your California Privacy Rights, Your European Union Privacy Rights, and Your Canadian Privacy Rights.

We strive to maintain the accuracy of any Personal Information collected from you, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to update our records when you tell us your information is not accurate. However, we must rely on you to ensure that the information you provide to us is complete, accurate, and up-to-date, and to inform us of any changes. Please review all of your information carefully before submitting it to us, and notify us as soon as possible of any updates or corrections as outlined in the section, Contact Us. In accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws, you may obtain from us certain Personal Information in our records. If you wish to access, review, or make any changes to Personal Information we hold about you, you may contact us as provided below in the section, Contact Us, or—for certain information—through your account on the Services. Please note, however, that we reserve the right to deny access as permitted or required by applicable Data Protection Laws.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the “Shine the Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we have disclosed to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once per year per person, must be sent to the email address in the section, Contact Us, and are free of charge.

Notwithstanding this right, we do not disclose Personal Information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

In addition to the above-listed rights, European Union privacy law provides individuals with enhanced rights with respect to their Personal Information. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the processing of Personal Information, these rights may include:

  * The right to object to decisions based on profiling or automated decision-making that produce legal or similarly significant effects on you;
  * The right to request restriction of processing of Personal Information or object to processing of Personal Information carried out pursuant to (i) a legitimate interest or (ii) performance of a task in the public interest (including, but not limited to, processing for direct marketing purposes);
  * In certain circumstances, the right to data portability (which means that you can request that we provide certain Personal Information we hold about you in a machine-readable format); and
  * In certain circumstances, the right to erasure and/or the right to be forgotten (which means that you can request deletion or removal of certain Personal Information we process about you).



Please note that we may need to request additional information from you to validate your request.

Our products are not directed to individuals under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16.

If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact our customer support team.

Please see [the privacy section of our FAQ](https://web.archive.org/about/faq#privacy).

Our provision of links to other websites or locations is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other websites or locations or their contents. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites.

We use data hosting service providers in the United States to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data. While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

  * **Account information:** We retain your account information until you delete your account. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations and to continue to develop and improve our products. Where we retain information for product improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our products, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you. 
  * **Marketing information:** If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, then we retain information about your marketing preferences unless you specifically ask us to delete such information. 



Unless otherwise required by law or to the extent we reasonably deem necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, and the rights, property, and safety of our users, we will delete Personal Information when: (1) it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; (2) when you withdraw your consent (where lawfulness of processing was based on your consent) and there is no other legal ground for the processing; (3) when you object to the processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing; and (4) when it is necessary to comply with legal obligations.

We use analytics systems and providers that process Personal Information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, and these systems and providers may provide some of this information to us. We do not currently process or comply with any web browser’s “do not track” signal or similar mechanisms.

This Privacy Policy replaces all previous disclosures we may have provided to you about our information practices with respect to our Services. To accommodate changes in our business, products, services, technology, and legal developments, we may add, change, or remove portions of this Privacy Policy as we feel it is appropriate to do so.
