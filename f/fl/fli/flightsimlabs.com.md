**YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**

You have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to find out more about these rights:

You have the right to:

**Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request** **“).** This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you. If you require this, then please reach out to our support team via email.

**Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.** This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. If you require this, then please reach out to our support team via email.

**Request erasure of your personal data.** This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. Please note that these retention requirements supersede any right to erasure requests under applicable data protection laws.

**Object to processing of your personal data.** This is in situations where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights. Please note that these requirements supersede any right to objection requests under applicable data protection laws. If you object to the processing of certain data then we may not be able to provide the Flight Sim Labs Products and Services and it is likely we will have to terminate your account.

**Request restriction of processing of your personal data.** This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Please note that any requests in relation to the restriction of the processing of your data means that we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (including the Flight Sim Labs Products and Services). In this case, we may have to cancel your use of the Flight Sim Labs Products and Services but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

**Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.** We will provide to you, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, which you can then transfer to an applicable third party. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. If you require this then please reach out to our support team via email.

**Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data**. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide the Flight Sim Labs Products and Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

**REPETITIVE / EXCESSIVE REQUESTS**

If your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

**IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE PERSONAL DATA**

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (including the Flight Sim Labs Products and Services). In this case, we may have to cancel your use of the Flight Sim Labs Products and Services but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

**COMPLAINTS**

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection, the Cyprus supervisory authority for data protection issues ([commissioner@dataprotection.gov.cy](mailto:commissioner@dataprotection.gov.cy)). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.
