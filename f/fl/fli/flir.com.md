You can set your browser to disable cookies, but this may prevent you from enjoying all of the features of the FLIR Site.

We use cookies to deliver content that is specific to your interests, to streamline the login process, and to collect anonymous user data in the aggregate.

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy Statement, FLIR does not disclose your personally identifiable information to outside parties.
