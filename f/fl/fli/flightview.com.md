#### How FlightView Uses Your Personal Information

This policy covers how FlightView treats personal information that FlightView collects and receives, including information related to your past use of FlightView products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

#### This privacy policy only applies to FlightView

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that FlightView does not own or control, or to people that FlightView does not employ or manage.

#### Information Collection and Use

FlightView collects personal information when you register with FlightView, when you use FlightView products or services, when you contact FlightView support or sales, when you visit FlightView pages or the pages of certain FlightView partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. FlightView may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.

When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. For some services we might also ask for your address. When you register with FlightView and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

FlightView collects information about your activities with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of products and services that we offer.

FlightView automatically receives and records information from your computer, browser or mobile device including your IP address, device ID, FlightView cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.

FlightView and our trusted partners use information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, deliver offers and information, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

#### Children

FlightView does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13.

#### Information Sharing and Disclosure

FlightView does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with FlightView under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help FlightView communicate with you about offers from FlightView and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of FlightView's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We transfer information about you if FlightView is acquired by or merged with another company. 



FlightView displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, men ages 25-39 from a particular geographic area. 

FlightView does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 

FlightView works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.
