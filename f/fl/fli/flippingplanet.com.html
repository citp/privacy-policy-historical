      <p><font size="2">Browsing this site doesn’t reveal your identity

      <p><font size="2">Any time you visit a page on the internet, you send 
      quite a bit of information to the server. The web servers that host this 
      site maintain access logs with the information that you send. These 
      servers are owned by third parties and this information is used to provide 
      site statistics and to get an idea of popular pages, what sites link here, 
      and which sites are sending visitors.&nbsp; The data logged may be used by 
      us to solve technical problems with the site and, in cases of abuse of 
      this site, to investigate the abuse.<br>
      <br>
      Comments, trackbacks, pingbacks and forms submitted here will be 
      identified by your IP address. It's sometimes possible to use these 
      numbers to trace/identify someone or the ISP or employer / educational 
      institution the IP address is registered to. Your IP address could 
      potentially be used in conjunction with other data to identify you. If 
      this is a concern please use an anonymous browsing service (see http://tor.eff.org).<br>
      <br>
      Some of the facilities on this site are usable only if you have cookies 
      enabled. You may wish to clear these cookies and the browser cache if you 
      wish to refrain from revealing any identifying information, especially if 
      you are using a public or shared computer.<br>
      <br>
      In general, it is not our practice to disclose personal information to 
      third parties. We may share personal information we collect in the 
      following circumstances:<br>
      <br>
      * As required by law, such as in response to a valid request from law 
      enforcement.<br>
      * To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints 
      or to enhance, add or maintain functionality of this site<br>
      * When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when 
      investigating technical issues.<br>
      * For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to 
      block the abusive user or to complain to that user’s Internet Service 
      Provider.<br>
      * If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.<br>

      community, or this website.<br>
