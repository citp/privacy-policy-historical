####  Cookies

Fleetmatics may use cookies to automatically collect information about your use of our websites. A "cookie" is a text file that is sent from a Web server to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device. Thereafter, when you visit that website, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser accessing the website, and this information about your activities is stored in the cookie. Use of cookies allows Fleetmatics to provide a higher quality, more relevant, customer experience. The information collected in cookies (e.g., the web pages you visit on the website and navigation patterns, the date and time of your visit, the number of links you click within the site, the functions you use on the site, the databases you view and the searches you request on the site, the data you save on, or download from, the site, the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting the site, and when you open our e-mails or click on any of their links) is used and analyzed to improve our service to you and to personalize your web-browsing experience by providing Fleetmatics with a better understanding of your interests and requirements regarding our websites and applications. Use of cookies may also allow us to automate entry into password-protected portions of our website so that you will not need to re-enter your password each time you visit such website. Cookies alone do not personally identify you; they are designed to recognize your web browser. However, if you have provided us with personal information, such as through completion of a web form, cookies may be linked to your personal information, such as your e-mail address or password.

Fleetmatics uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-cookies. Session cookies exist only during one session.

Strictly necessary cookies

These cookies enable you to navigate our websites and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of the websites and using Fleetmatics’ Services. These cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests.

If you have chosen to identify yourself to Fleetmatics, we use cookies containing encrypted information to allow us to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the web site or the Services, a cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed on your browser.  
| Because required cookies are essential to operate the Fleetmatics websites and the Services, there is no option to opt out of these cookies.   
  
Performance cookies

| 

Anonymous usage cookies or “performance cookies” are used to associate a random session identifier with the usage activity that occurred during that session. Usage activity may include things like what pages were visited, how long a page was viewed, what page links were clicked on the most. This information is useful to create an overall view of how the greater community of users is interacting with our products and services.

|  By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. You may decline these cookies by modifying your browser settings, though this will prevent you from successfully using the Services.   
  
Functionality cookies

| 

These cookies allow Fleetmatics’ websites to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. These cookies may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other website.

By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. You may decline these cookies by modifying your browser settings, though this will prevent you from successfully using the Services.  
  
Targeting cookies or advertising cookies

| These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. 

Fleetmatics sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies remember which visitors have visited the Fleetmatics websites. The information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after Fleetmatics receives it. 

We also contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons (see below) on our websites, from emails, and on third-party websites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting information through the website through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other websites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.
