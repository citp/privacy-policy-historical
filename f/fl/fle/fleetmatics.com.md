# Privacy Policies | Verizon

At Verizon, we are committed to maintaining strong and meaningful privacy protections for customers. Our privacy policy is designed to inform you about the information we collect, how we use it, and your options about certain uses of information.

Verizon's privacy policy applies to website visitors, app users, applicants and customers in the United States.  It applies across the Verizon family of companies and the products and services we provide, except it does not apply to our Oath affiliate which has a separate privacy policy.  In addition, some Verizon services and apps, such as [go90](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/go90-app-privacy-policy), [MapQuest](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/mapquest), [hum](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/hum-privacy-policy), [Message+](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/verizon-messages-app-privacy-policy) and [AppFlash ](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/appflash-privacy-policy)have additional privacy practices that are presented separately. If there is a conflict between this privacy policy and the service-specific policies, the service-specific policy governs when you are using that service.

A [separate policy](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/international-policy) governs the collection of personal data by the Verizon family of companies outside the United States.

Below, we've summarized key elements from our [full privacy policy](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy) for your convenience.

#### Information we collect and how it is used

We collect and use information when you interact with us, when you use our products and services, and when you visit our websites. This information is used to deliver, provide and repair products or services; establish and maintain customer accounts and billing records; contact you about our products and services and direct offers or promotions to you; monitor website statistics; and manage and protect our networks. Information may also be aggregated or de-identified for business and marketing uses by us or by third parties.

We may also obtain consumer information from outside companies who provide such data. We use this data and combine it with other information we have to help us analyze and model customer information, predict customer preferences and direct marketing offers.

#### Information provided to or used by third-party advertisers

Verizon and third-party advertisers seek to provide advertising that is more relevant to your interests on  the websites, apps, services and devices you use. Advertising technology companies present on our sites may place [cookies](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/cookies) on your browser when you visit our sites and others, use device identifiers or use similar technologies to collect information about your activities on our websites or apps and may combine this information with similar information they obtain from other websites and apps.

We also may help third-party advertisers target their ads using certain information about customers, without sharing information that identifies you individually. You have choices and may limit the use of your information. [Learn more.](http://www.verizon.com/about/privacy/full-privacy-policy#information_provided_to_or_used_by_third-party_advertisers)

Except as explained in our Privacy Policy, in privacy policies for specific services, or in agreements with our customers, Verizon does not sell, license or share information that individually identifies our customers with others outside of Verizon who are not doing work on Verizon‘s behalf without your consent. We may share information with our vendors and partners for business purposes and when necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. Verizon may also share certain non-personal identifiable information with outside companies, for example, to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns, provide aggregate business and marketing insights, or share de-identified information.
