# Privacy Policy

My privacy policy is simple to understand:

  * Personal information: When you register for this site, you are required to provide your email address for verification. I may send you emails occasionally to notify you of theme updates, new products or other offers that may be of interest to you. I hate spam as much as you do, so I refuse to share your personal information with any other parties. You will always have the option to opt out of future email messages.
  * Cookies: My site does not use cookies other than the normal session cookies used by WordPress for keeping you logged in. Some links on the site may be links to other sites and those sites may place a cookie on your computer for sales tracking purposes only.
  * Credit card information: Any products available for sale are hosted on a third-party server and all payment processing is handled securely via PayPal. I do not have access to any of your payment information.



If you have any questions about how I use your personal information, please [contact me](http://www.flexibilitytheme.com/contact/).
