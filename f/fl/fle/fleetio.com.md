You can review the most current version of the Policy at any time at [https://www.fleetio.com/privacy](https://web.archive.org/privacy).

#### INFORMATION GATHERING

We collect, use and disclose two types of information: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.

  1. “Personal Information” is information that is directly associated with a specific person or entity, including but not limited to, names, email addresses, usernames, passwords, and payment information.
  2. “Non-Personal Information” is information we collect or compile that by itself cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity.
  3. We may further compile “Non-Personal Information” into “Aggregate Data”. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Data, and we may share Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Data that we collect or compile with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customer needs and improve our Service, and for advertising and marketing purposes.
  4. We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Service. That information includes your computer’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language, and referring website addresses. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and files or pages accessed or used by you.
  5. You reserve the right to ask us what personal data is being processed and the rationale for such processing if that should ever be unclear.
  6. While using our Service, you will have access to all data within your account. You reserve the right to access this data and/or request copies of this data.
  7. While using our Service, you’ll be able to update all personally identifiable information to maintain accuracy.
  8. You maintain the right to withdraw consent to manual or automated data processing when previous consent has been given. This could include all future processing or processing during a specific timeframe. This could include removal of data from an account or a request to remove an email from a specific mailing list.
  9. You reserve the right to erasure and data portability. You will have the ability to export data in your account and keep for yourself or import into another system. After Service cancellation, data will not be retained on our servers if requested in writing. In addition, you can delete any type of personally identifiable information within your account or request to be removed from any type of customer communication at any time.



#### COOKIE POLICY

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. For example, we use cookies to enable you to use the Service without re-entering your username and password if you select to use the “Remember Me” functionality. A “web beacon” is an electronic image that is embedded in a web page. We use “web beacons” to count visits and compile statistics on usage or in our emails to tell if an email has been opened or acted upon.

We have also included information about cookies set by third parties. Given that these relate to third party services, we cannot guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the list, but we can say that we have done our best to ensure the list is as accurate as possible at the time this policy was prepared. Nevertheless, we strongly recommend that you consult the third party websites listed in the cookie descriptions to find out more about the third party cookies in question.
