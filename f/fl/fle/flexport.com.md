We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. Our privacy practices may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements.

On our Web sites, you may have an opportunity to post user-generated content using social networking tools available on those sites.

Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal information with any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

We will respond to such requests within a reasonable time and, in any case, within the time limits established by applicable law. We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity.

#### Data Transfers

We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected.

If you are located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, we comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the EEA or Switzerland.

#### How We Protect Personal Information

We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technological measures to protect the confidentiality and security of information about you. Unfortunately, no Web site, server or database is completely secure or "hacker proof." We therefore cannot guarantee that information about you will not be disclosed, misused or lost by accident or by the unauthorized acts of others. Flexport never collects information for third party commercial marketing purposes nor does it create individual profiles or provide your information to any third party organization. Flexport will only share your information with third parties when and as you request or as otherwise required by law.

#### Use of Our Web Sites by Children Under the Age of Thirteen

We are proud of our Web sites and we strive to ensure that they do not offend people of any age. However, unless otherwise noted on a particular site, our Web sites are not intended for children under the age of thirteen years without the permission of a parent or guardian. If you believe that a child has submitted personally identifiable information on or through our Web sites without the consent and supervision of a parent or guardian, please contact us using the information provided below so that we can take appropriate action.

#### Links to Other Web sites

Our Web sites may provide links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. These Web sites may operate independently from Flexport. Linked sites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review. In addition, a link to a non-Flexport Web site does not mean that Flexport endorses or accepts any responsibility for the content, or the use, of such Web site. It is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever you select for your use is free of such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses and other items of a destructive nature. Flexport is not liable for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites and to the extent any linked Web sites you visit are not owned or controlled by Flexport, we are not responsible for the sites' content, any use of the sites, or the privacy practices of the sites.

#### Updates to Our Global Privacy Policy

This Policy describes Flexport's current data protection policies and practices. We reserve the right to update it periodically and without prior notice to you to reflect changes in those policies and practices. When we do, we will post the revised version behind the link marked "Global Privacy Policy" at the bottom of each page of our Web sites.
