### Automated decisions

We may make automated decisions based on personal information we hold about your business, yourself, directors, shareholders, personal guarantors and any linked associates. Automated decisions assist us in making decisions which can affect the products, services and pricing.  

 _(i) Approving Credit_

We use an automated system to run your application through our initial lending criteria to determine if we are able to provide funding to your business. Your application will either be accepted or rejected based on the criteria set by ourselves. We also use credit data to assess the creditworthiness of your business and the likelihood you will pay back any money you borrow. This includes data about your credit history and that of your business.  In addition to the credit score of the directors and that of the business, we may also consider additional information including other financial information to be able to reach an overall decision to lend.

 _(ii) Statistical Analysis_

We may carry out periodic statistical analysis or testing to ensure the accuracy of existing and future products and services. To that effect, we may place you in segments to understand our customers’ needs and manage our relationships with them. 

_(iii)  _ _ _Prevention of Money Laundering__

We may use  personal information to (i) verify your identity, the directors, partners, shareholders, personal guarantors and that of your financial associates (ii) undertake checks for the prevention and detection of crime, fraud and/or money laundering (iii) identify if your personal or business information have been used for fraud or money laundering purposes and where we believe that there is such a risk, we will report  our suspicion to the National Crime Agency as required by law.

 _(iv) Pricing_

We may decide what to charge for our products and services based on credit risk data analytics.

 _(v) Your rights over automated decision_

Under GDPR, you have rights to request that our initial decision to accept or reject your application is not based on the automated decision only or you can object to the latter or request for the decision to be reviewed.

Please contact us on dataprotection@fleximize.com if you wish to have more information about these rights. 

#### Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs)

We carry out credit and identity checks with at least two CRAs when you apply for a loan for your business.

On submitting the application, you agree that you have the full consent of all parties and any linked “financial associates” i.e. a person with whom you may have had or have a joint personal financial arrangement such as joint accounts or have made joint credit applications which may be your spouse or partner, or civil partner. 

If the applicant is a sole trader, we may check any financial associate. If the application is for a business partnership, we may check each partner and their financial associates and where the application is for a limited company, we may check each director, shareholder and their financial associates. The credit file of all personal guarantors may also be checked. By submitting any application form, you agree that you have the full consent of each related party. 

We will share personal information such as name, residential address, date of birth, telephone number, email address of directors, shareholders, personal guarantors, linked associates including business details with the CRAs. The latter will provide us with the financial situation and credit history information on the business and the individuals including their linked financial associates. Public information from the electoral register, Companies House, county court judgments, bankruptcies and fraud prevention/anti money laundering information will also be provided. 

We will use the information received from the CRAs to: 

  * Assess the creditworthiness of your business, yourself and your financial associates; 
  * Verify the details on your application and ensure what you have told us is accurate; 
  * Verify your identity and that of your financial associates and undertake checks for the prevention and detection of crime, fraud and money laundering; 
  * Manage your accounts with us; and 
  * Trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe us. 



Where you borrow from us, we will give details of your accounts and how you manage it to CRAs. We will continue to share your personal information with CRAs if you are our customer, and these will include information on your loan, current balance and repayment history. 

The above information may be shared by the CRAs with other lenders who may want to check your credit status and that of your business. 

Searches we undertake on your credit file will leave a footprint and may impact your credit file. In most cases, the footprint left will be a director search. All the footprints may be seen by other lenders. 

Where you are making an application with someone else or you tell us you have a spouse, partner or civil partner or that you are in business with other partners or directors, we link and search information about you and your associates at the CRAs. 

CRAs will also link your records together and these links will remain on your credit files until you or financial associate provides proof to the CRAs that you are no longer financially linked. 

You can contact the CRAs currently operating in the UK in order to check the information they hold about you.  The information they hold may not be the same, so it is worth contacting them all. Below are links to the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice which provide information about them, the data they hold, how it is shared and your data protection rights.

  
  


#### Fraud Prevention

As part of our application process, we will need to confirm the identity of your business, your own identity, the identity of the directors, shareholders personal guarantors and linked financial associates and therefore exchange your personal information with CRAs in order for them to assist.

Both ourself and the CRAs can only use your personal information if we have a proper reason to do so; such as to obey the law or where we rely on legitimate interest and it should not unfairly go against what is best for you. The following information will be shared with the CRAs: 

  * Name; 
  * Date of birth; 
  * Residential address; 
  * History of where you have lived; 
  * Contact details, such as email addresses and phone numbers; 
  * Financial data such as the company bank account details; 
  * Data relating to you or your businesses products or services; and 
  * Data that identifies computers or other devices you use to connect the internet such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address.



Information from the CRAs will help us conduct the following: 

  * Confirm identities and residential address; 
  * Help prevent crime, fraud and money-laundering; 
  * Fulfil any contracts you or your business has with us; 
  * Checking details on prospective candidates and employees as part of their employment; and 
  * Trace your whereabouts. 



Where we suspect fraud or money laundering, the CRA and us may share your personal information with law enforcement agencies.  

As far as fraud and money laundering prevention is concerned, we shall keep your data as for as long as we exist. However, the CRAs may keep them for a different length of time. 

We may submit the information you provide to us through our automated system that will identify fraud patterns and indicate unusual activities for you and your business. Either of these could indicate a possible risk of fraud or money-laundering and where that is the case, we will reject your application and report it to the National Crime Agency accordingly. We and the CRAs may keep a record of the risk you or your business pose to our business.

### Overseas Transfers

We may transfer your personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). If your information is transferred to or is accessible, in any countries which is not considered by the European Community to adequately protect personal data, we will always take steps to ensure that your information is protected, and those transfers comply with applicable privacy laws.  We may transfer your information to other countries, including those outside the European Economic Area, either for storage and back up purposes or if we engage suppliers, sub-contractors or third-party data processors who are based or have operations overseas. We will always take steps to ensure that your information is protected and that those transfers comply with applicable privacy laws. 

##### Transferring data outside of the EEA 

We will only send your data outside of the EEA to: 

  * Adhere to your instructions 
  * Follow our legal obligations 
  * Work with suppliers, sub-contractors or third-party data processors. 



Where we send data outside of EEA (other than the USA), we have in place a Model Contract with the Processor that imposes similar requirements on them whereby, we have required them to implement similar data protection standards as applicable to us. We have also assessed the security measures in the processor’s business to ensure the processing of data is effected as per the standards of the new data protection law.

Where we send data to the USA, we will ensure that we transfer to organisations that are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. This means that your data will be processed and protected under the same standards as imposed by the data protection regulation within the EEA. 

### Marketing from us and Member Benefit Schemes

As part of our marketing strategy, we may use your personal information to analyse which products, services and offers may be relevant for you.

We may use your personal information to send you marketing messages in relation to our products and services and to advise you of offers available to yourself via the Member Benefit Schemes based on legitimate interest. That is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information. It must not unfairly go against what is right and best for you. 

As a member, you will have full control over your marketing preferences with us and would be able to activate and access carefully selected offers from our trusted third-party partners that we believe will be of added value to your business.  We will generally update your members area with offers available to you, but we may also send you emails or letters by post to inform you of new and relevant offers. We will not pass your personal data to these organisations unless you request this or redeem an available offer. If you do not wish to receive updates on third-party offers, you can opt-out via your member area. 

You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages by updating your marketing preferences by logging in your member’s area.  However, you will still receive mandatory and key service communications such as any changes to your existing products and services with us. 

We may ask you to confirm or update your choices, if you take out any new products or services with us in future. We will also ask you to do this if there are changes in the law, regulation, or the structure of our business. 

If you change your mind you can update your choices at any time in your member’s area. 

### Referring to Third-Party Providers

In the event, your business does not satisfy our lending criteria and we cannot lend to you, we may where you have consented to it, pass your personal details such as your name, email address, contact details, credit application to third party lenders and brokers who may assist you in obtaining credit.  You will be contacted directly by them to discuss your credit application
