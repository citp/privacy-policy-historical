    <p>
        FlexJobs is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. We strive to provide
        a safe, secure user experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the online data
        collection and usage policies and practices that apply to the FlexJobs website.
    </p>
    <p>This site provides access to third party content and links. You understand and agree that we're only acting as a conduit and that we have no liability related to the third-party, whether arising under the laws of copyright, libel, privacy or obscenity. </p>

    <h2>
        Collection and Use of Information by FlexJobs</h2>
    <p>
        In some areas of FlexJobs, we request or may request that you provide personal information,
        including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, contact information,
        and any other information from which your identity is discernible. In other areas,
        we may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your ZIP
        code, preferences, gender, interests. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination
        of the two types of information.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of FlexJobs, such
        as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information
        about your computer hardware and software that is or may be collected by us. This
        information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain
        names, access times and referring Web site addresses, but is not linked to your
        personal information.
    </p>
        <p>
        Your data will be stored and processed in the United States. The information we
        gather on the FlexJobs site may be shared within the FlexJobs-affiliated companies
        on a worldwide basis in order to deliver the products and services we offer or in
        order to undertake analysis of our database.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the FlexJobs site
        or refer a job posting to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email
        address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or
        her to visit the FlexJobs site to view the job posting. We do not store this information.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Our Use of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        We use the information we gather on FlexJobs, whether personal, demographic, collective
        or technical, for the purpose of operating and improving our service, fostering
        a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have provided consent for us to do so, we may also use the information we
        gather to inform you of other products or services available from us or our affiliated
        companies.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other communications
        regarding updates at the FlexJobs site, to contact you about your opinion of current
        products and services or potential new products and services that may be offered.
        We may also provide additional communications, promotions and information on new
        FlexJobs opportunities and additional job postings which may be of interest to you.
        The nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information
        we have about you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, you may receive free informational newsletters from us relating to
        topics that may be of special interest to you, such as career management advice.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have areas on the FlexJobs site where you can submit feedback. Any feedback you
        submit in these areas becomes our property, and we can use such feedback (such as
        success stories) for marketing purposes or to contact you for further information.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Choices Regarding the Disclosure of Personal Information to Others
    </h2>
    <p>
        We do not disclose your personal information to third parties, or your combined
        personal and demographic information or information about your use of FlexJobs,
        except as set forth below.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>We disclose information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. We use
            data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed)
            to determine whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products or services
            of a particular affiliate. </li>
        <li>We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions
            on our behalf. Examples include hosting our Web servers, analyzing data, providing
            marketing assistance, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals
            will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions,
            but they may not share that information with any other third party. </li>
        <li>We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a
            governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary
            to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect
            our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect
            national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. </li>
        <li>We disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial
            portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation
            or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event
            we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary,
            we or our trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information
            in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Personal Information on Resumes, Profiles, Cover Letters, and Work Samples</h2>
    <p>
        Since FlexJobs is a career site, you can store your profiles, resumes, cover letters,
        and/or work samples in our database. In doing so, we give you two options regarding
        the accessibility of your information:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>You can make your information available only to users registered with FlexJobs.
        </li>
        <li>You can make your information available to any visitors to our site, including search
            engines. In doing so, your information is considered part of the public domain.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof)
        only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource
        professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this
        database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who
        access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. However, the portions
        of your searchable resume (not your contact information) that are automatically
        made public in your FlexJobs profile are accessible to anyone who uses the FlexJobs
        service. You may remove your resume on FlexJobs or delete your profile on FlexJobs
        at anytime, but, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to the
        FlexJobs resume database or to obtain a copy of that database or have paid for access
        to the FlexJobs services, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access may
        have retained a copy of your resume or FlexJobs profile in their own files or databases.
        We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles
        in these instances.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Posting to Public Areas of FlexJobs</h2>
    <p>
        Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public areas
        of FlexJobs or FlexJobs Networking, such as in online forums, blogs or chat rooms,
        or in the FlexJobs searchable resume database, such information may be collected
        and used by others over whom we have no control. We are not responsible for the
        use made by third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in
        public areas of FlexJobs.</p>
    <h2>
        Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience and time
        online. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page
        server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
        Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a Web server
        in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
    <p>
        One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
        you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
        to a specific page. For example, if you personalize FlexJobs pages, or register
        for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user
        name, password and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster
        and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return
        to FlexJobs, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
        easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click
        streams and for load balancing.</p>
    <p>
        You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
        accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies
        if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to
        notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies
        on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder
        performance and negatively impact your experience on FlexJobs.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Access to and Modification of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        You may review, correct, update or change your MyFlexJobs account at any time. From
        your MyFlexJobs account you may also opt out of receiving newsletters and certain
        other information from FlexJobs.</p>
    <p>
        To change your MyFlexJobs account information, simply log into your account, go
        to your Account Management, review your account information and, if you wish, edit
        it with the options provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        We retain indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an effort to make
        your repeat use of FlexJobs to make our service more efficient, practical, and relevant.
        Of course, you can delete your resume from FlexJobs's online database, close your
        MyFlexJobs account at any, in which event we will remove all our copies of your
        resume from FlexJobs, except for an archival copy which is not accessible on the
        Internet.</p>
    <h2>
        Security of the Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures
        designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
        access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized
        third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information
        for improper purposes.</p>
    <h2>
        Children</h2>
    <p>
        The FlexJobs site is not intended for children under 18 years of age. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children under 18.</p>
    <h2>
        Changes to Privacy Statement</h2>
    <p>
        If we decide to materially change our Privacy Statement for FlexJobs and FlexJobs
        Networking, we will post those changes through a prominent notice on the web site
        so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information,
        and to whom we will disclose it.</p>
