Flextronics' sole purpose for operating websites is to provide information concerning its services and products to customers, vendors, business partners, employees and others. Flextronics recognizes the importance of maintaining the privacy of any personal information collected through the websites it operates. Therefore, visitors can reach Flextronics on the Web without revealing any personal information. Visitors may elect to voluntarily provide personal information via Flextronics websites – but are not required to do so – when filling out and submitting online questionnaires concerning feedback on the website, requesting information on products or services, or seeking employment. The personal information voluntarily provided by website users is contact information limited to the user's email address solely used for the purpose of answering questions and forwarding requested information. Flextronics does not ever sell or share this information with non-agent third parties.
