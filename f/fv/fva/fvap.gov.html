<h2 class="centeralign">Example of Information Collected for Statistical Purposes</h2></a>
<p class="leftalign">
Below is an example of the information collected based on a standard request for 
a World Wide Web document:
<br><br>
<strong>xxx.yyy.com - - [28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500]<br> 
"GET /sitename/news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0" 200 16704 <br>
Mozilla 3.0/www.altavista.digital.com</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>xxx.yyy.com (or 123.123.23.12)</strong> -- this is the host name (or IP address) associated with the requester (you as the visitor).  In this case, (...<strong>.com</strong>) the requester is coming from a commercial address. Depending on the requestor's method of network connection, the host name (or IP address) may or may not identify a specific computer. 
<br><br>
Connections via many Internet Service Providers assign different IP 
addresses for each session, so the host name identifies only the ISP.  The 
host name (or IP address) will identify a specific computer if that computer has a 
fixed IP address.
<br><br>
<strong>[28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500]</strong> -- this is the date and time of the request
<br><br>
<strong>"GET /sitename/news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0"</strong> -- this is the location of the 
requested file
<br><br>
<strong>200</strong> -- this is the status code - 200 is OK - the request was filled
<br><br> 
<strong>16704</strong> -- this is the size of the requested file in bytes
<br><br> 
<strong>Mozilla 3.0</strong> -- this identifies the type of browser software used to access the page, 
which indicates what design parameters to use in constructing the pages
<br><br>
<strong>www.altavista.digital.com</strong> -- this indicates the last site the person visited, which indicates
how people find this site
<br><br>
Requests for other types of documents use similar information.  No other user-identifying information is collected.
