We (the Financial Services Authority - FSA) receive personal information through this website. You may, for example, be asked for personal information if you want to take advantage of specific services that we offer, such as ordering online or subscribing to our publications.

Where you provide personal information, we will only use it to deliver the services you have requested. 

This privacy policy only covers the FSA's website.

The FSA site does not automatically capture or store personal information, other than logging your IP address and session information such as how long your visit lasted and the type of browser used. This is recognised by the web server and is only used for system administration and to provide statistics, which we use to evaluate how the site is used. 

This policy does not cover links within this site to other websites.

We use cookies to make sure your session on this website is secure. We also use embedded pixels - with cookies, these help us to track how many people are using our site. These collect data about the paths that users take when navigating our website. We use this information to evaluate site content, navigability and composition, as well as page response rates (how quickly pages download). With both cookies and embedded pixel technology, the information we collect is anonymous and does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. We cannot personally identify you.
