<h2>1. Definition of Policy &amp; Revision Date</h2>
<p>
 This Privacy Protection Policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes our privacy collection
 and protection policies and those of our affiliates. This Privacy Policy was last revised 
 August 13, 2004. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or 
 control or to people that we do not employ or manage. In addition, certain companies with whom 
 we contract have their own privacy statements which can be viewed by clicking on links on such 
 companies' websites. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the privacy of  
 your personal information. This privacy policy applies to all of the websites   owned by us and 
 describes the methods for collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information. 
 As used herein, "personally identifiable   information" means any non-public information 
 that that would enable us or a   third party to identify or contact you by electronic or other 
 means. We encourage you to carefully read this privacy policy in its entirety.
 </p>
 
<a name="collect" id="collect"></a>
<h2>2. Method for Collection of Information</h2>
<p>
 We collect non-public personally identifiable information by asking you for it when you order 
 or signup for a service and when you contact technical support or customer service. Such 
 information may include your name, physical address, telephone number, credit card or bank 
 account information and/or email address.  We may share this information with our commonly owned 
 affiliates. We may also receive similar information from our strategic partners that have already
 obtained information from and/or about you in accordance with their respective agreements with you 
 and we may combine information that we receive from you with information that we receive from our 
 strategic partners or others. Once you register with us, you are not anonymous to us. We may also 
 use "cookies" and similar technology to obtain information about your visits to our 
 sites. While cookies help us improve your experience while visiting our sites, you may block  
 them through your Internet browser or other commercially available software. However, in doing so, 
 you may make some of our sites' features no longer accessible. We automatically receive and 
 record information on our server logs   from your browser, including your IP address, our cookie 
 information and the pages you request.
 </p>
 
<a name="infouse" id="infouse"></a>
<h2>3. What we do with Non-Public Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>
 We use the personally identifiable information we collect principally to provide you with the 
 service(s) you have ordered, to collect payment from you on account of the services that you 
 receive from us and to let you know about other offerings which may be of interest to you. 
 Postal   and e-mail address information, for example, enables communication about services 
 offered and ordered, as well as the proper provisioning and billing of those services. Like 
 most businesses today, we use third-party vendors to carry out certain functions and the 
 delivery of certain services to you. And like most businesses today, we share online data with 
 those third-party vendors to the extent necessary for them to perform their work. For example, 
 we may use a third-party payment processing company in order to process credit card payments. 
 In such an instance, we will share your personally identifiable information in order to verify 
 the credit card account information that you have submitted to us. We contractually require 
 such third-party vendors to use personally identifiable information that we share with them 
 only for the purpose(s) for which it was shared. We also contractually require such entities 
 to protect such information from any further or otherwise improper use. In addition, we may 
 share such information with other industry and credit-related organizations to improve operations 
 and to protect against fraud, security and credit risks. We do not otherwise rent, sell or 
 share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to 
 provide products or   services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the 
 following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>From time to time, we may provide personally identifiable online information in response 
  to subpoenas and other legal demands from law enforcement agencies or in response to court 
  orders.</li>
  <li>We may also use or disclose personally identifiable information when we believe that this 
  information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal   action against individuals who 
  may be endangering public safety or interfering   with or improperly using our property or 
  services, or interfering with our customers' or others' use of our property or services.</li>
  <li>We may use the email address you provide to give you product announcements, service updates 
  or additional information that you may request.</li>
  <li>In the future, should we decide to share such data with third parties for marketing, it will 
  provide notification to you and will give you the opportunity   to indicate whether you would 
  prefer that we not provide such information about you to third parties.</li>
  <li>Because this information is a critical part of our business, in the event of a merger, sale 
  or other corporate reorganization or legal proceeding involving our company or companies, 
  your personally identifiable information would be treated like our other assets (and could 
  be transferred along with our other business assets). In this event, we will notify you before 
  information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 We do not market to, or knowingly collect personal information from, children under the age of 
 13 on any of its websites.
</p>

<a name="security" id="security"></a>
<h2>4. Security of information</h2>
<p>
 All personally identifiable information is maintained in secure databases. We use multiple layers 
 of encryption, firewalls and other technology to ensure the security of  your personal information,
 and to prevent unauthorized access or improper use.
</p>

<a name="other" id="other"></a>
<h2>5. Other websites</h2>
<p>
 Some links on our websites may take you to websites operated and/or controlled by third parties. 
 As you surf the web, please be mindful of the respective identifications of the entities 
 operating the websites that you visit and remember that we have no control over the collection 
 or use of information on third-party websites, or the use of any personal information that you 
 may provide in connection with the use of such websites.
</p>

<a name="commit" id="commit"></a>
<h2>6. Commitment to Security &amp; Privacy</h2>
<p>
 We are committed to maintaining the security of your personally identifiable information and 
 promoting trust and confidence on the Internet.
</p>

<a name="accept" id="accept"></a>
<h2>7. Acceptance of Policy, subject to change</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to revise or modify this policy, or any other policies or agreements at 
any time without prior notification. By using   our services, you accept the terms and conditions 
of this policy.</p>

<a name="contact" id="contact"></a>
<h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
<p>
As a customer, you are able to modify your personally identifiable information online. If you do 
not have access to the internet for any reason or do not know where to go to view and/or modify 
your information, feel free to contact our Client Relations department using the information 
that follows.
