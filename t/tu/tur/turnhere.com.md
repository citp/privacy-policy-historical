# Privacy Policy | TurnHere Internet Video

Effective May 11, 2009

TurnHere wants to be your trusted source for informative and entertaining film descriptions of cool places around the world, and we are committed to respecting your privacy rights. To protect any Personal Information that you may furnish while visiting www.turnhere.com (the "TurnHere Web site", or the "Web site"), we have created the following guidelines. The information collected on the Web site may be shared with our Partners or Service Providers, and used by them in accordance with the terms set forth in this policy.

### Information Collected

While visiting the Web site we may ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") for purposes of interacting with the Web site. Such Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, company name, phone number, street address, e-mail address and, for certain services, credit card information. On any page that collects Personal Information, we will specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service, enter you in the promotion you have requested, or respond to your inquiry or comment. Information collected online is often defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable:

  1. Anonymous Information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that thousands of people have visited this Privacy Policy web page, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from visits such as this constitutes anonymous information. Many of the individuals who access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the only data we collect about them is anonymous information.
  2. Personal Information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, email address or phone number. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to provide Personal Information to TurnHere so that we may provide valuable services to you. Registering with TurnHere will also cause a cookie to be issued; this cookie allows TurnHere to "recognize" you when you are on our site to allow us to personalize our service for you.



**Anonymous Information:** As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically-collected data as well as any information received from third parties to Personal Information.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. See "Third Party Advertisers."

**Personal Information:** In order to use the basic features of this Web site, you need not register or provide any Personal Information. We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share Personal Information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy. We believe we can enhance your experience on our Web site with the information you share with us. We use Personal Information about you to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze Web site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the Web site's content, layout, and services. We may also use your Personal Information, such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from you regarding the information that we have collected, or respond to your comments and suggestions. While we believe these services will enhance your experience at our Web site, you will at all times be able to opt out from receiving these communications, either by specifically opting out of these services or by deleting your profile from our database. We also may disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential advertisers, partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, and for other lawful purposes.

We may also offer other services as a part of our Web site (e.g., weather information alerts, contests, sweepstakes and other promotions with unaffiliated third parties). If you choose to use these optional services or opportunities, we may provide some of your Personal Information to these parties. We will not do so without telling you in advance, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures by choosing not to use these services or features of the Web site.

Depending on the services you have chosen to use, some or all of your Personal Information may be used by TurnHere to provide such services. Personal Information may also be provided to intermediaries and third parties, including credit card processors, who assist TurnHere in providing you with the service you request. Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, however, TurnHere will not share, rent or sell your information to third parties without your permission.

TurnHere is the sole owner of the information collected on www.turnhere.com. TurnHere may collect Personal Information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

#### Send-To-A-Friend

If you choose to use our service to tell a friend about a film you saw on our Web site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email. Your friend may contact us at [legal@turnhere.com](mailto:legal@turnhere.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.

We will occasionally send you information on services, special deals, products and/or promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Choice/Opt-out."

#### Service-related Announcements

We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.

#### Customer Service

Based upon the Personal Information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, if you have provided such information.

#### Profile 

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, or clear gifs to create a "profile" of your preferences. We may tie your Personal Information to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you.
