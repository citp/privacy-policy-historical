**Lawful Basis for Processing Your Data:**

Turning will process your personal data based on the following Legal Basis for Processing according to Article 6 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):

  * Consent: you have given consent for the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose. If you reside in a country governed by GDPR, then you must actively “opt in” for Turning to have your consent.  Regardless of where you reside, you always have the right to “opt out” at any time.
  * Legitimate interests: the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of Turning as we work with your organization to provide you the services.

–  Name

**Purposes of Personal Data Collection and Use:**

In order for you to set up an account and use our response technologies, you need to provide Turning with certain personal information that can associate you with your specific account.

**Your Rights Regarding Personal Data Provided to Turning:**

  1. The right to be informed – meaning Turning must make clear what they are processing, why, and who else the data may be passed to.
  2. The right of access – which is your right to see what data is held about you by Turning.
  3. The right to rectification – which is your right to have your data corrected or amended if what is held is incorrect in some way.
  4. The right to erasure – which is your right, under certain circumstances, to ask for your personal data to be deleted. This is also called ‘the Right to be Forgotten’. This would apply if the personal data is no longer required for the purposes it was collected for, or your consent for the processing of that data has been withdrawn, or the personal data has been unlawfully processed.
  5. The right to restrict processing – which gives you the right to ask for a temporary halt to Turning’s processing of personal data, which may impact your ability to use our software
  6. The right to data portability – which is your right to ask for any personal data supplied to Turning, to be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
  7. The right to object – which is your right to object to further processing of their data which is inconsistent with the primary purpose for which it was collected, including profiling, automation, and direct marketing.
  8. The right to consent and withdraw consent related to how your personal data is used.
  9. The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.



These access rights may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access. If you would like to request access to, correction, amendment, or deletion of your personal data, you may request a data access form at [privacy@turningtechnologies.com](mailto:privacy@turningtechologies.com).  We may request specific information from you to confirm your identity. Requests will be responded to without delay and within one month of request being submitted. In some circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information. You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.

**Data Sharing:**

**Data Retention:**

Turning will retain the personal data that we collect about you for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in the Turning Technologies Policy. Please be aware that we may also be required to retain your personal data for legal and accounting reasons.

**Use By Children:**

We do not intend to collect personally identifiable information from children through the Website. If you are considered a minor as defined in your jurisdiction (i.e., country, state or territory), you should consult with a parent or guardian about the use of the Website.

Our emails provide users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving Turning’s marketing communications.
