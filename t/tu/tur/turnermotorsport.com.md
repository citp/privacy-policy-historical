# Privacy Policy | Turner Motorsport

Your privacy is important to Turner Motorsport, LLC ( **“Company”, “we”, “us”** ). This privacy policy ( **“Policy”** ) explains how Company collects, uses, and discloses information through its websites, platform, mobile applications and other online services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the **“Services”** ) or otherwise interact with us. If you obtain your use of the Services in connection with the services offered by a third party, the individual terms of that third party’s contract with us and its own privacy policy may differ from what is described in this Policy. 

**Changes to This Policy.**

We may change this Policy from time to time. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “last updated” date above. If there are material changes to this Policy and you have an active account with us, we will notify you more directly. We encourage you to check this Policy whenever you use any of Services to understand how your personal information is used. 

**Information Collected.**

We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Services. We may also supplement this information with information from other companies. We collect two general types of information: personal information and aggregate data. As used in this Policy, the term **“personal information”** means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and email address), and demographic and other information when directly linked to information that can identify an individual. 

Our definition of personal information does not include **“aggregate data”**. Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, no personal information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Services. 

The following are the specific types of information we collect from you: 

> **Information You Give Us.** We collect information you give through our Services, and when you register for and use our Services. Examples include the following: 
>
>> **Registration and Contact Information.** When you register to use our Services or update your profile, we may collect various kinds of information about you including, your name and email address; shipping address; company name, company title, and other profile information you provide; demographic information; and information you upload like photos. 
>> 
>> **Device and Activity Information.** When you use your mobile device with the Services, data recorded on your mobile device about your activity is transferred from your mobile device to our servers. This data is stored and used to provide the Service and is associated with your account. We also collect information about any rehabilitee protocols you may be using. 
>> 
>> **Payment and Shipping Information.** If you choose to order a product through the Services, our payment processing vendor collects your payment card information and billing address, and your shipping address and other contact details, such as email address and phone number, may also be collected. 
>> 
>> **Submissions and Company Services.** From time to time we may use surveys, contests or sweepstakes requesting personal or demographic information and customer feedback. If you choose to order a product through the Services, you may post a Product review. 
> 
> **Automatically Collected Information.** We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Services. For example, it is standard for your web browser to automatically send information to every web site you visit, including ours. That information includes your computer’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language, and referring web site addresses. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and files and pages accessed or used by you. 
> 
> **Cookies and Web Beacons.** We may also use certain kinds of technology such as cookies and web beacons to collect information. Among other things, the use of cookies and web beacons enables us to improve our Services and emails by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing our web site, to personalize and improve your experience, to record your preferences, and to allow you to visit our Services without re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount of data which is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify your browser setting to reject our cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie by editing your browser options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the web site and services may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and access certain web page features or services. A web beacon is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be used on our web pages to deliver cookies, count visits and compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness or in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. 

**Use of Personal Information.**

In general, we use your personal information to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Services and to otherwise serve you and our users. For example, we may use your personal information:

> 
> Between and among Company and our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership; 
>

The Services may include features that by their nature support sharing your content (i.e., photos, videos, text) that you upload or post on the Services in a public forum, such as a discussion forum or product reviews. Other users of the Services can see personal information you choose to share, such as your location, interests, occupation and birthday; and they can post comments in response to certain of your public submissions. 

This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate data, and we may share aggregate data about you and our users with third parties for various purposes in perpetuity, including to help us better understand our customer needs and improve our Services, to provide new Services and for advertising and marketing purposes. 

**Network and Information Security.**

We take reasonable steps to protect information we collect from you to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. 

The servers on which information is stored are kept in a controlled environment with limited access. While we take reasonable efforts to guard personal information we knowingly collect directly from you, no security system is impenetrable. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any collected personal information you choose to include in the Services are maintained at adequate levels of protection to meet specific needs or obligations you may have relating to that information. 

**Data Retention**

We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law. 

**Data Transfers**

To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to our servers in the United States or other countries. When we transfer information from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to countries that have not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we employ data processing agreements based on the Standard Contractual Clauses to help ensure that your data is protected wherever it is transferred. You may request a copy of these clauses by contacting us at info@turnermotorsport.com. 

When we transfer personal data from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States, we comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. 

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us. We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution - American Arbitration Association, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution - American Arbitration Association are provided at no cost to you. 

Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. Company is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. 

If we share personal data transferred to the U.S. under the Privacy Shield with a third-party service provider that processes such data on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
