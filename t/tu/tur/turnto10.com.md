# Privacy Policy - Local News - TurnTo10.com | WJAR

For each visitor to the Web site, MEDIA GENERAL's servers automatically collect information about which pages are visited and the domain name (e.g.TurnTo10.com) of visitors. This information is used for internal review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for Web site traffic audits. We also provide this information (as well as information from third-party market researchers) about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.

MEDIA GENERAL may place a "cookie" on the browser of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. A cookie may be used to tell when your computer has contacted the Web site. MEDIA GENERAL uses the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as delivery of features and advertisements, so MEDIA GENERAL can customize delivery of information to you without compromising privacy. For example, cookies may be used to ensure that you will not see the same banner advertisement too often in a single session.

Through your use of the Web site, MEDIA GENERAL may collect information about you that identifies you or your household. Normally, you would provide such information when specifically asked for it by MEDIA GENERAL. Any information in MEDIA GENERAL's possession solely as a result of your use of the Web site and that is associated with you or your household is considered "Personal Information." It consists of both information supplied by you (e.g. name, address, telephone number and e-mail address) and information collected about how you use the Web site (e.g. the fact that you have bought merchandise through the Web site). It does not include aggregate information (e.g. the total number of household users older than 18 years, the zip code in which a user lives) or information that you have made public on the Web site or that is otherwise publicly available.

MEDIA GENERAL uses Personal Information only for purposes necessary to provide the Web site and other products and services to you. These purposes are:

  * to process requests or orders placed with advertisers or merchants
  * to perform such normal business operations as billing, collecting and accounting
  * to personalize and publicize the Web site based on your interests, including making you aware of editorial features, advertisements and commercial items
  * to investigate complaints and to protect the Web site and MEDIA GENERAL, its readers and employees as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by legal counsel for MEDIA GENERAL



Except as necessary to process your requests or orders placed with advertisers or merchants featured on the Web site, MEDIA GENERAL does not rent, sell, barter or give away any lists containing Personal Information for use by any outside company. MEDIA GENERAL also respects the privacy of data on your personal computer and does not access, read, upload or store data contained in or derived from your private files without your authorization.

**Links**   
The MEDIA GENERAL site contains links to other sites. MEDIA GENERAL is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites, including any sites that may indicate a special relationship or partnership with MEDIA GENERAL (such as co-branded pages or "powered by" or "in cooperation with" relationships). MEDIA GENERAL does not disclose personally identifiable information or unique identifiers to those responsible for the linked sites. The linked sites, however, may collect personal information from you that is not subject to MEDIA GENERAL's control. To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policy of the sites you may visit by linking from the MEDIA GENERAL site.

**Opt Out Procedures**  
You always may opt out of receiving future mailings or other information from MEDIA GENERAL. If the mailing does not have an e-mail cancellation form, send e-mail to comments@mediageneral.com detailing the type of information that you no longer desire to receive.

**Children's Privacy**  
The following additional terms, conditions and notices apply to use of the Web site by children under the age of 13 years whenever MEDIA GENERAL becomes aware that a user is in that age range:

• Users under 13 years of age may not submit or post information on the Web site without the consent of the user's parent or legal guardian. Prior to collecting any personal information about a child under 13, MEDIA GENERAL makes reasonable efforts to obtain consent from the child's parent after informing the parent about the types of information the MEDIA GENERAL will collect, how it will be used, and under what circumstances it will be disclosed.

• Although MEDIA GENERAL will apply these children's terms and conditions whenever it becomes aware that a user who submits Personal Information is less than 13 years old, no method is foolproof. MEDIA GENERAL strongly encourages parents and guardians to supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools also can prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.

• "Personal information" collected from children may include any of the information defined above as "Personal Information" with respect to general users of the Web site and may be used by MEDIA GENERAL for the same purposes. Except as necessary to process a child's requests or orders placed with advertisers or merchants featured on the Web site, MEDIA GENERAL does not rent, sell, barter or give away any lists containing a child's Personal Information for use by any outside company.

• If a child enters a game, contest or other activity sponsored by MEDIA GENERAL on the Web site, the child may be required by MEDIA GENERAL to provide the minimum Personal Information reasonably necessary for the child to participate in such activity.

• A child's parent or legal guardian may request MEDIA GENERAL to provide a description of the Personal Information that MEDIA GENERAL has collected from the child, as well as instruct MEDIA GENERAL to cease further use, maintenance and collection of Personal Information from the child.

• If a child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail address or other personally-identifying information on chat areas, bulletin boards or other forums or public posting areas, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other parties.

**General**  
These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and MEDIA GENERAL with respect to use of the Web site, superseding all prior or contemporaneous communications and/or proposals. MEDIA GENERAL reserves the right to make changes to these Terms and Conditions immediately by posting the changed Terms and Conditions in this location. By continuing to use the Web site, you are agreeing to all changes made by MEDIA GENERAL. A printed version of these Terms and Conditions shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to use of the Web site to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.

The Web site is controlled and operated by MEDIA GENERAL from its principal office in the State/Commonwealth of Virginia, USA. MEDIA GENERAL makes no representation that materials on the Web site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who choose to access the Web site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The Web site is not intended to subject MEDIA GENERAL to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than the State/Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America.
