**This privacy policy is effective as of November 15, 2010**

Turn Inc. (“Turn”) provides advertisers and publishers (“Business Partners”) access to a set of technologies and processes designed to display advertisements to consumers viewing a publisher’s website(s) (the “Turn Ads”).

### Site Privacy Policy

The Site is intended primarily to offer information about Turn and the services we provide.

**Information Collected via the Site** | We collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII” or “Personal Information”) from the Site when you choose to provide it to us. PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but is not limited to: name, postal address, telephone number, or email address. For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on this Site. We use this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry. Once collected, we will store your PII for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes. The information that we store is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.

We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) via the Site. Non-PII cannot be used to contact any single person or entity and may include your IP address, pages viewed on this Site, browser type, Internet Service Provider, the time/date of your visit to this Site, and your computer’s operating system (e.g., Windows XP). Turn uses this information for internal purposes such as to administer the Site, improve and customize the Site, help Turn understand and analyze how the Site is being used and to track aggregate Site usage.

**Cookies and Web Beacons** | Turn uses cookies and web beacons in connection with our Technology. Cookies help Turn better understand the effectiveness of a Turn Ad (for example, by tracking the way in which you may respond to, select and interact with a Turn Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which you view a Turn Ad). Turn’s cookies also help control the number of times you view a Turn Ad. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites you visit. As an alternative to deletion/disabling of cookies, you can also choose to [opt out of receiving targeted advertising in connection with our Technology](https://www.turn.com/privacy/optout).

Turn also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows Turn to record that someone has visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon.

**Third Party Websites** | Turn Ads may contain links to other websites, including those of our Business Partners. Such websites may use cookies and/or other data collection tools. Turn is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such websites. Turn encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website. Turn has no control over the use of any information by third party websites, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any PII. Similarly, while Turn contractually requires that our Business Partners adhere to law and industry self-regulatory codes such as those offered by the DAA and NAI, Turn does not have access to, or control of, the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed on any advertisement by a third-party. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party.

**Access / Updating / Deleting your PII** | If you’d like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any PII that you have provided to us on this Site, please send your request to us at [privacy@turn.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20131226045606id_/http://www.turn.com/privacy/&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#097;&#099;&#121;&#064;&#116;&#117;&#114;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;) and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.

### Information Collection and Use

Turn is a member of the [Network Advertising Initiative](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) (“NAI”) and is in compliance with the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Principles.

**Overview of Turn’s Technology** | Our Technology collects information about the website(s) that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online. You may encounter our Technology: when Turn or one of our Business Partners purchase online advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when one of our Business Partners places one of our web beacons on its website, which you visit.

We use the information collected by our Technology in order to help make the Turn Ads you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.

**What information is collected?** | Turn does not collect PII via our Technology. Our Technology does collect and use Non-PII, including: the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many Business Partner web pages have been viewed, search terms entered on Business Partner websites, referring/exit pages, and the date and time a Turn Ad was viewed.

Turn uses this information to analyze trends, identify the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement and to tailor advertisement placement for our Business Partners accordingly. We also may aggregate this information and share it with Turn’s affiliates, advertisers, employees, customers and Business Partners.

Turn does not create nor use any sensitive data segments to tailor ads on behalf of our advertiser clients. However, we recognize that consumers may have differing opinions regarding which data segments are sensitive. In order to provide transparency around potentially sensitive data segments collected and used by Turn, we will provide examples of them here. For example, we may collect health related segments of consumers that we believe may have an interest in healthy living because they have visited websites that are focused on health related topics such as yoga and healthy living. Similarly, we may collect financial related segments of consumers that we believe may have an interest in investing because they’ve visited websites that are focused on investment strategies or searched for ”investment tips.”

While we don’t consider any of the above data segments to be sensitive, we think it’s important to provide this transparency to help you have a better idea of which segments might be collected by us, so you can make informed decisions.

**Cookies and Web Beacons** | Turn uses cookies and web beacons in connection with our Technology. Cookies help Turn better understand the effectiveness of a Turn Ad (for example, by tracking the way in which you may respond to, selectand interact with a Turn Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which you view a Turn Ad). Turn’s cookies also help control the number of times you view a Turn Ad. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites you visit. As an alternative to deletion/disabling of cookies, you can also choose to [opt out of cookie-based data collection](https://www.turn.com/privacy/optout).

Turn also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows Turn to record that someone has visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon.

**Third Party Links and Websites** | Turn Ads may contain links to other websites, including those of our Business Partners. Such websites may use cookies and/or other data collection tools. Turn is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such websites. Turn encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website. Turn has no control over the use of any information by third party websites, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any PII. Similarly, while Turn contractually requires that our Business Partners adhere to law and industry self-regulatory codes such as those offered by the DAA and NAI, Turn does not have access to, or control of, the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed on any advertisement by a third-party. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party.

**Information Relating to Children** | Our products and services are designed for those 13 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13. If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under 13, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.

### Info Storage / Security / Integrity

**Storage of Non-PII** | We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to 180 days in order to ensure that our Technology is functioning properly. After 180 days, we render this information anonymous and store it for up to three years.

**Information Security** | The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about our security practices, please send an email to us at [privacy@turn.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20131226045606id_/http://www.turn.com/privacy/&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#097;&#099;&#121;&#064;&#116;&#117;&#114;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;).

**Data Integrity** | Turn processes information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current and reliable for its intended use.

### Access/ Info Sharing / Disclosure

Turn will allow an individual access to their Personal Information to the extent it is available and allow the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. If you’d like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any PII that you have provided to us, please send your request to us at [privacy@turn.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20131226045606id_/http://www.turn.com/privacy/&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#097;&#099;&#121;&#064;&#116;&#117;&#114;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;) and we will process your request within a reasonable period of time after receipt.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure** | _Disclosure of Information to Third Parties_ We do not collect PII via our Technology, and we do not sell, rent or share PII collected on the site with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. We may, however, share your PII with trusted third party contractors who provide services for us. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for us.

We may share Non-PII collected via our Technology with Web Partners. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via our Technology with Non-PII collected from Business Partners. This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually.

We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII collected via the Site, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.

### Enforcement, Questions and Complaints

Turn uses myriad processes to ensure compliance with this privacy policy and periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented and accessible and in conformity with the Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns using the contact information provided and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of information.

To address any issues regarding our compliance with the NAI Self-Regulatory Principles, Turn, along with the NAI and other NAI members have created a compliance program that incorporates attestation reviews, a consumer complaint process, sanctions and annual reporting to help ensure that member companies keep their promises to you and abide by the NAI’s Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct.
