### How does Turtlediary use my information?

### Who is collecting information?

When you are on the Turtlediary site and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with Turtlediary alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise.

These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

### How does Turtlediary protect children's privacy?

Turtlediary is committed to protecting the safety and wellbeing of children, and we continually work to ensure that our data collection practices conform to all applicable laws, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

We are required by law to obtain parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose Personal Information from Children who are under 13 years of age. Turtlediary does not ask a child under age 13 for more personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity. Such personal information may include the child's name and email address as gathered upon registration, messages that the child may post via message boards or chat rooms, email inquiries as well as information gathered passively via Cookies. Turtlediary does not gather information on the ages of our users and will never knowingly share personally identifying information about users who are under the age of 13 with business partners or other third parties.

A Parent has the right to review their Child's personal information, either by logging in to the Child's account profile or by contacting us directly. A Parent may update their child's personal information directly in the account profile. Additionally, a Parent may ask us to delete their child's personal data and close the account, which would further prohibit future collection or use of the child's personal information. Upon such request, we will delete the Child's account and all the information and data stored for such account to the extent possible. When we delete such data, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives. 

Turtlediary may (and the Parent authorizes us to) rely on the instructions that we reasonably believe are given by a Child's Parent. For example, if a person contacts our technical support and provides the requisite account information, we may assume that the person calling is the Child's Parent.

* * *

### What else should I know about my privacy?

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas) that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

Some Turtlediary services offer the option to show your name and e-mail address in various capacities. If you decide to show your name and e-mail address, you are making it available to others over the Internet.

Additionally, some Turtlediary services offer the ability to build custom Web pages or customize the content on a Web page. Just like any other Web-page building tool, the pages thus created can be accessed by anyone over the Internet. Please do not include any information on your Web page that you do not want to disclose over the Internet. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN SUCH CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS OR OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS.
