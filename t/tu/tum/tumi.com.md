## What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored?

We collect and store personal information that you enter into this Site or that you provide through your dealings with TUMI’S Offline Channels, the TUMI Tracer® program, to any TUMI employee, affiliate or agent.

Personal Information is information you provide that lets us know specific facts about you so that we can fulfill your orders and/or customize information we deliver to you. The personal information that we collect from you and store or that is submitted by you when you open an account, place an order, or otherwise transact business with us may include, but is not limited to: (i) your name; (ii) your address; (ii) your email address; (iv) your telephone number; and/or (v) your credit card or other payment information. This personal information is used to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations and to provide customer service. Some of this information also may be used to contact you about sales, special offers and new site features, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications from TUMI.

By choosing to provide TUMI with your personal information, you consent to the use of your personal information as provided in this Privacy Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection. You may withdraw or limit your consent at any time by following the steps set forth in "Can I Indicate Whether or Not I Want To Receive Promotional Communications?" below or by contacting our Customer Service Department by email at [service@tumi.com](mailto:service@tumi.com) or by phone at [1-800-299-8864](tel:1-800-299-8864).

We collect and store certain other information automatically whenever you interact with this Site. For example, we collect your IP address, browser information and reference site domain name every time you visit this Site. We also collect information regarding customer traffic patterns and site usage. This information is used to analyze and improve this Site and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.

When you visit our website, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our site and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the time and date of your visits, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. During your visits to other websites where we advertise, we (or third parties) may use certain data collected on our site to show you the type of TUMI.com advertisements likely to be of greater interest to you. Although you may not opt out of receiving online advertisements generally, you may control the collection of data on our site used for targeted TUMI.com advertising during your visits to other websites.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our website. Also, like many Web sites, we use "cookies", which are files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. Cookies help us to identify account holders and to optimize their shopping experience. Cookies also allow us to hold selections in a shopping cart when a user leaves this Site without checking out. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on this Site.

We also may collect and store information about you that we receive from other sources, to enable us to update and correct the information contained in our database and to provide product recommendations and special offers that we think will interest you.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

## Is Information Collected From Children?

We do not sell or ship any items ordered through this Site directly to anyone who we know to be under the age of 18, nor do we collect any personal information from anyone who we know to be under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you should use this Site only with the involvement of a parent or guardian and should not submit any personal information to us.

## With Whom Do You Share Information?

We do not share with others any personal information that you provide to us through this Site or through this Site's Customer Service Department, except with your consent or as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may share personal information that you provide to us through this Site or through this Site's Customer Service Department with our affiliates and service providers. In turn, our service providers may share this personal information with their affiliates and with service providers whom they engage to perform services related to this Site or the operation of our business. Examples of these services include Web Site operation, payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, customer service, marketing and promotional material distribution, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing. These service providers are authorized to use this personal information only in connection with the services they are engaged to perform.

We may use the services of one or more third parties to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and determine how customers use this Site. To do this, we may use web beacons and cookies provided by third parties, which enable us to collect information such as product codes and prices for merchandise that customers purchase and the pages visited. This information helps us to learn things like what pages are most attractive to our customers, which of our products most interest our customers and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.

Our site may, from time to time, include third party advertising. We do not provide personal information to these third party advertisers; however, they may use technology to send the advertisements that appear on our Site to your browser. In this process, the third party advertiser automatically receives your IP address. They may also employ cookies and web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their own advertisements and personalize your interaction with them. We do not have access to or control over the cookies, web beacons or other technology they may use, and the information collected by these third party advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please contact them directly for further information regarding their information privacy policies. For your reference, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about internet advertising companies, including methods of "opting-out" of their information collection practices. 

We also may offer you the opportunity to purchase products and services provided by third parties. If you purchase any of these products or services, we will provide your personal information to the third parties that provide them for that purpose.

We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: the law or legal process requires it; we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency or court; or such release is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of TUMI, or any of our affiliates, service providers, customers or others.

We may share non-personal information with our marketing partners, advertisers and others from time to time. Examples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this Site during a specific time period or purchased a specific product through this Site. This information generally is shared in an aggregated form.

As with any business, it is possible that as our business develops, we might sell or buy online stores or other assets. In such transactions, information about customers often is among the transferred assets. Accordingly, in the unlikely event that TUMI, or substantially all of its assets related to this Site, is acquired by a third party, such information may be one of the transferred assets. Under such circumstances, TUMI would to the extent possible require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time.

By using this Site, you acknowledge and consent to the fact that personal information provided by you or collected by us through your use of the Site is stored and processed by us in the United States where data protection laws may not afford the same level of protection as those of the country in which you are located (this is the case for users located in the European Economic Area ("EEA")). You also acknowledge and consent to the fact that we may, at our discretion, store and process such data in other countries (including countries outside the EEA) where data protection laws may not afford the same level of protection as those of the country in which you are located.

## What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information Secure?

Various security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, are used to protect personal information that we collect. If you place an order through this Site, you will be asked to set up an account and provide an email address and password. You must provide, among other information, an appropriate email address and password in order to access account information. Please note that while we have endeavoured to create a secure and reliable site for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from this Site cannot be guaranteed.
