### Using the Tumi Website

Like most websites, the server upon which the Tumi website resides automatically collects data about your visit to the site, including your computer’s IP address, your web browser type, operating system type, and what pages linked you to the site. We refer to this server-collected information as “traffic data”. Tumi may utilize such aggregated traffic data to interpret the usefulness and popularity of the website, and to develop improvements to it. Tumi may make traffic data available to employees, contractors or other third parties to the extent necessary for them to perform certain site-related services on Tumi’s behalf.

The Tumi website may make use of temporary or session “cookies” in order to enable the basic functionality of the website. Third-party links may appear on the website and, if so, those third parties may set and access cookies on your computer. Those organizations will have their own privacy policies that govern their use of any personal identifiable information. Most web browsers have the capability of rejecting cookies, and if you are concerned about their usage, you are encouraged to avail yourself of that technology. Please be advised, however, that the Tumi website may not function properly for you without cookies.

Children under 13 years old are not the target audience for the Tumi website. To protect their privacy, Tumi prohibits the solicitation of personal identifiable information from these children.

### Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put into place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect both online and at Tumi stores and sponsored events. The Tumi website utilizes a Cisco firewall and SSL encryption to keep your personal information secure.

### Disclaimer

Tumi reserves the right to change, modify or update this policy at any time without notice. Any substantial changes in the way of your personal information is used will be posted on the Tumi website.
