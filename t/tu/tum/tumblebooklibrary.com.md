# TumbleBooks - eBooks for eKids!

**TumbleBooks Inc. Privacy Policy**

**Commitment  
**TumbleBooks Inc. is committed to principles of Internet safety and respect for your privacy. We share this commitment with our affiliate enterprises KidContent Inc., Tumbleweed Press, and 10belowzero.com, all of which subscribe to the same Internet Privacy and Safety Policy, set out below. In fact, one of our earliest publications is _Surfing Safely_ , a story designed to teach children (and adults) about Internet safety. We recommend that users of all ages take a few minutes and view this TumbleBook™ title in our TumbleKids section and heed the advice contained in it.

**Privacy and Safety Policy  
**We respect your privacy. As we develop our online activities we will revise our Privacy and Safety Policy to respond to legal and practical requirements and changes in technology. The terms of this Policy form part of the Terms of Use and TumbleReader™ End Users License Agreement that govern this web site and its use.

Complete confidentiality and security is not yet possible over the Internet. Internet use is subject to interception, loss and alteration. You acknowledge and agree that TumbleBooks Inc. and its affiliates shall not be responsible for any loss or damages you may suffer as a result of the transmission of confidential or sensitive information over the Internet, and that all such communications are at your own risk, provided all reasonable precautions have been taken by TumbleBooks Inc. and its affiliates.

It is the responsibility of parents to monitor use of the Internet by children and to instruct and supervise children accordingly. It is our responsibility to take all reasonable measures, having regard to existing technology, to preserve and safeguard the safety and privacy of our users of all ages.

We collect information generated by use of our sites for the purpose of assessing technical performance and enhancing user experience. From time to time we may also request and you may choose to send us personal information through one of our web sites or through e-mail addresses available at our web sites.

We will not collect sensitive information about you from anyone else without your consent. All information is maintained in a place and format that benefits from every reasonable security measure available.

We will not sell, rent, trade, share, reveal, or disclose any of your personal information unless:

  * You provide your consent and are above the age of 16 (if you are below the age of 16, we will never convey such information except for the reasons below)
  * We are required to do so pursuant to a legal or governmental order, rule, or law
  * We reasonably believe that use or disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious or imminent threat to an individual’s life, health, safety, or well being or to the public health or safety
  * We reasonably believe unlawful or improper activity has been or may be engaged and such disclosure is to aid in the investigation or prevention of such activity



Children should always ask parents for permission before sending any information about themselves over the Internet. Any personal information we gather from children (16 years of age or younger) may be used for demographic or profile purposes or internal site use analysis and may be shared in aggregate form only.

In accordance with the above principles, we may use Cookies and other user analysis devices
