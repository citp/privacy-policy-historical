TUSD respects the privacy of all visitors to the district web site at [www.tusd.k12.az.us](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229073324id_/http%3A//tusd1.org/index.htm) (also known as [www.tusd1.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229073324id_/http%3A//tusd1.org/index.htm)) and protects your privacy to the extent permitted by law. 

You can read and download information at the TUSD web site without identifying yourself or providing any personal information.

  * information you voluntarily provide through email messages, web forms, and surveys.
  * information automatically gathered through web visit logs.
  * information collected by network traffic logs.



**Voluntary Information**  
We do not collect any personal information about you unless you voluntarily choose to provide it to us by sending email, completing online forms, or filling out online surveys. You are not required to participate in any of these activities to view or download any information from our web site.

If you send an email message to the TUSD webmaster, your email message will be answered directly by the webmaster or forwarded to the TUSD employee best able to address your message.

The following types of information may be requested by online forms:

  * Your name.
  * Your email address.
  * Your phone number.
  * Your affiliation with TUSD.
  * Comments or information solicited by the specific form.



Your responses to an online survey will be used to fulfill the purpose of that survey.

Any personal information that you voluntarily provide to us through email messages, forms, or surveys will only be used to respond properly to your request. TUSD does not share, disclose, or sell email addresses or phone numbers to other organizations.
