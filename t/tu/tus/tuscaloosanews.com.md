# privacypolicy | TuscaloosaNews.com | Tuscaloosa News

This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for Tuscaloosa News newspaper and TuscaloosaNews.com (the “Site”). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to "Tuscaloosa News" include TuscaloosaNews.com and Tuscaloosa News newspaper. Tuscaloosa News is part of The New York Times Regional Media Group ("NYTRMG") – a division of The New York Times Company.

Third party sites that TuscaloosaNews.com links to are governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those websites or other websites to which they link.

In this Privacy Policy, you will find answers to the following questions:

  * What information do we gather about you?
  * What do we do with the information we gather about you?
  * What is our e-mail policy?
  * With whom do we share the information that we gather?
  * How do I change or update my personal information?
  * How do I opt-out from receiving promotional offers?
  * Is my information protected?
  * Other information: Compliance with legal process
  * Other information: Children's Guidelines
  * Other information: Changes to this Privacy Policy



## What information do we gather about you?

The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.

#### Personally Identifiable Information

### Registration for our Web sites

Anyone can view the Site, but a free registration process is required to access the full range of information and services we offer.

TuscaloosaNews.com requires that you supply a unique e-mail address and demographic information (zip code, age, sex, household income to register. By using TuscaloosaNews.com, you are agreeing to the terms of our [Member Agreement](https://web.archive.org/termsofservice)).

### Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers

On occasion, Tuscaloosa News collects personal information from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than Tuscaloosa News, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer. 

### Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research

Tuscaloosa News may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Web sites, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.

### Mobile Messaging Service

We may elect to offer certain text messaging services (the "SMS Service"). We use the information collected from your interaction with the SMS Service solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed, except as required by law. We will not use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage: their practices are governed by their own privacy policies. 

Tuscaloosa News collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and Tuscaloosa News. When you send a text message to Tuscaloosa News or via Tuscaloosa News, we log the incoming phone number, the wireless provider associated with the number, and the date and time of the transaction. The only information we automatically collect is that related to the use of our Mobile Services. Tuscaloosa News uses this data to analyze the message traffic in order to operate, develop and improve our SMS Service. 

#### Non-personally Identifiable Information

### Information Collected by Us using Technology

As is standard practice on many Web sites, we use “cookies”, Web Beacons and other similar technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. You will not be able to access certain areas of our Web sites, including TuscaloosaNews.com, if your computer does not accept cookies from us.

We reserve the right to place a TuscaloosaNews.com cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.

For more detailed information about our use of cookies, see the “[Cookies](https://web.archive.org/section/registrationfaq#cookies)” section on the [Registration FAQ](https://web.archive.org/section/registrationfaq).

### Information Collected by Third Parties using Technology

Some of the services and/or advertisements on certain of our Web sites (including TuscaloosaNews.com) are delivered or served by third-party companies that may place or recognize cookies or Web Beacon to track certain non-personally identifiable information about our Web site users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, some advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, in order to collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Web sites and other Web sites. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads based on your interests on other Web sites.

We do not have access to, nor control over, advertisers’ or service providers' cookies or how they may be used.

You have choices about the collection of interest based information in this way:

  1. If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of cookies, and about your option not to accept these cookies, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp).

### Yahoo Ads

Yahoo! is an ad network partner that displays ads on NYTRMG sites. To improve your ad experience on NYTRMG sites and elsewhere on the Internet, we may send non-personal information to Yahoo! based on your browser's activities, such as type of pages viewed and categories of interests, so that the advertising you see is relevant to you. Yahoo! also may use information regarding its own users to select which ads to display. [Learn more about Yahoo!'s ad practices](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/details.html), including how to opt out of using anonymous information to select which ads to show you.

### Analytics Technologies

NYTRMG, of which we are a part, is currently using Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to administer our Web site and constantly improve its quality. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of TuscaloosaNews.com is owned and used by Tuscaloosa News or NYTRMG. Tuscaloosa News reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its Web site visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers.

## What do we do with the information we gather about you?

### Statistical Analysis

Tuscaloosa News may perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of subscribers, and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base.

### Banner Advertising

We may use behavioral, demographic and preference information to allow advertising on our Web sites to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. We will disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.

### User Generated Content (Message Boards, Forums, Reader Reviews and Chats)

We offer message boards for readers in a number of areas throughout our Web sites. The message boards are currently hosted and managed by Grouppee, a third party vendor. Any information you disclose when posting to a message board, along with your message board screen name or ID, becomes public and may be used by Tuscaloosa News for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. Chats are also currently hosted by Grouppee, and any posting to a chat becomes public as soon as they are published online. For more information, see the Terms of Service.
