**Collecting Information About You**

You can visit most of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. 

There may be times, such as when you subscribe to a service or participate in a survey, at which we ask you to provide certain information about yourself. This may include your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, birth date, gender, personal interests, etc. Whether or not to provide such information is your own personal choice. But if you choose not to provide information we request, you may be unable to access certain services, offers, or content on our Web site.
