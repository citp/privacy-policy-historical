Privacy Policy

Argela committed to protecting your privacy. Before providing us with any of your details, please read the following important information which concerns the protection of your personal data.

We will hold and process any personal information which you provide via the Site or by submitting emails and/or online forms for our own internal business purposes, including lawful purposes relating to recruitment where information is sent by you via the recruitment part of the Site. We do not pass on or sell online personal information to third parties. We may however share information within our organisation and in some cases it will be necessary to pass information to our pension or share administrators. This may include our employees, agents, contractors and sub-contractors. Please note that by sending your personal information to us you are explicitly consenting to the processing and transfer of such information in this way.

In addition to the information you submit to us via the Site, we may collect information about visits to the Site. We collect information on the page browser access. This is used within the Argela group to improve the design and layout of our sites. We gather information on the relative popularity of each page, the average number of pages accessed by visitors, the number of emails sent or files downloaded, and the average time spent on the site. None of this information is linked back to you as an individual.

In collecting information about visits to the Site, we may use "cookies" to identify visitors to the Site and to build up a demographic profile. A cookie is a small piece of text which attaches to your hard drive (but does not access your hard drive) and from which it can store and sometimes track information on how you make use of a web site. Most browsers will automatically accept a cookie but it is possible to set your browser to notify you prior to it being sent and at which point you can accept or reject it.

We may provide hyperlinks from the Site to websites of third parties. Please note that this privacy statement applies only to the contents of the Site and not to those web sites to which we may provide a link.

If any information with which you have provided us becomes inaccurate or out of date, or if you have any queries about this privacy statement, please contact us via this website.
