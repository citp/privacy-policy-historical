It is Tufts' policy to hold all personal information you supply in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy law.

#### Information Gathered About You or Your Devices

We collect information when you access one of the Services and when you subscribe to our email services.

_**Device Information**_

We may collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the Services such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language or other information of this nature. We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the Services.

    _IP Address._ Your IP address is automatically assigned to your device by your Internet Service Provider. An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services. We use IP addresses for several purposes, such as security, calculating usage levels, and diagnosing server problems. We also use your IP address to administer our Services by identifying (1) which parts of a Service are most heavily used, (2) where our users come from (i.e., a referring sign or a search engine, etc.), and (3) which portion of our audience comes from within or outside the Tufts network. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable unless we are required to do so under applicable law or court order or authorized to do so under our policies.

    _Physical Location._ We may use your device's physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content. We may also share your device's physical location with our service providers to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device's location, but if you do, we and/or our service providers may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.

_**Use of Cookies**_

Cookies are small files that are stored on your device and are used to collect and store information. This may include: which pages you see; how long you stay; what you click on our pages; if you visit the website again; and which country and city you are browsing from.

    _Types of Cookies._ A _session cookie_ is temporary, linking the actions of a user during any given browser session. When the browser is closed, the cookie is deleted. A _permanent cookie_ , also known as a _persistent cookie_ , is stored for a specific period of time and activates each time the user visits the website that created the cookie. A _third-party cookie_ is placed by a domain other than that of the website the user is visiting. Further general information about cookies and how they work is available at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

    _Why we use Cookies_. We use session, permanent and third-party cookies for security purposes, to display information more effectively, to understand and save your preferences for future visits and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction, so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. Cookies further allow us to select which of our programs, initiatives, offerings and services are most likely to appeal to you and to display them while you are on the Services.

We may contract with selected third parties to place cookies through the Services to provide us with better insights into the use of the Services or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about a user's online activities over time and across different websites when they use our Services. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

Some third-party cookies may originate from websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest or other social media services. Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy policy pages of these sites directly.

_**Use of Technology to Track Users of Services**_

    _Google Analytics_. One or more of our Services may also use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to track website statistics. Google Analytics uses cookies and other technologies to track visitor interactions and collects the IP address of website visitors in order to provide us a sense of where our visitors come from. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors or reporting IP addresses to us.

We use the information collected to understand how our visitors are using the website and make improvements for a better online experience. We do not use Google Analytics to track or collect personal information (name, email address, billing information or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information) and we do not associate personal information with web analytics information.

To see the full Google Analytics privacy policy and learn more about its privacy practices, please see [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy), [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/), and [Google Analytics: Safeguarding Your Data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245). You can opt out of the services by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

    _Pixel Tags_. One or more of our Services may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons, tags or clear GIFs) that embed graphic files in our Services. These graphic files contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Services, or, in the case of web beacons, opened an email that we have sent them.

These small data files or graphic files serve a variety of functions. In some instances, they may be necessary to deliver a particular service. Even when they are not essential to the delivery of a service, they may provide information that enables us to improve the performance and functionality of our services and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. They may also enable us to customize our services and provide advertising messages that are more relevant to you and your interests.

    _Adobe Flash Technology._ We may use Flash Local Shared Objects (Flash LSOs) and other similar technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.

_**Adjusting Cookie Settings**_

You can change your cookie settings by reviewing your internet browser's cookie options. Most browsers allow you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular website. The links below to popular browsers may help you understand your cookie options better. Typically, such information can be found under the browser's 'Help', 'Preferences' or 'Options' menus. You may also wish to refer to <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html>. We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track request signals.

  * [Cookie settings in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
  * [Cookie settings in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer#w_cookie-settings)
  * [Cookie settings in Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)
  * [Cookie settings in Safari – iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)
  * [Cookie settings in Safari – macOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac)



    _Blocking Cookies._ Should you choose to decline or block cookies by adjusting your browser settings, including cookies essential to the Services, please note that all or parts of our Services may not be functional or accessible to you. Our Services will issue cookies as soon as you visit the Services, unless your browser cookie settings are adjusted to prevent such an occurrence.

    _Interest-Based Advertisements._ Some of our Services engage in online interest-based advertising to enhance your experience and show you advertisements that might interest you. Like many organizations, we and our advertising partners display tailored interest-based advertising on the Services and on third-party platforms using information you make available to us when you interact with our Services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as searching on our Services or visiting other websites, apps or online services that contain our content or ads. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like mobile identifiers, cookies, and pixel tags.

To learn more about interest-based ads or to opt-out of receiving third-party interest based ads, please visit [http://optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/), or [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/), or Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page. Please note that if you opt out of interest-based advertising, you will still see advertisements – they will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, note that deleting browser cookies can remove the cookie preferences you have made, so you may need to opt-out again in the future.

#### Email Terms

When you give us your email address, we may use it to respond to inquiries, requests or questions, or to communicate information about the University or its activities. If you do not wish to receive communications from Tufts, please click on the unsubscribe link in the body of the message.

Depending on the context in which you submitted your contact information, your data may be accessible to Tufts and its schools, departments, institutes, centers, and divisions connected to Tufts.

In addition to the information described under Information Gathered About You or Your Devices above, we may obtain personal information about you from third parties.

**Partners and Service Providers**

Some of these partners have access to personal information about you that we may not otherwise have (for example, if you sign up directly with that provider) and may share some or all of this information with us. We use this information to administer our services and conduct marketing and advertising campaigns, as well as to process transactions that you request.

If you link to any third-party site through a Tufts' Site, Site content, or Site services, please be aware that you are doing so at your own risk. Tufts University encourages you to review any third-party website's terms or use and privacy policy as those, and not Tufts University's Terms of Use and Privacy Terms, are applicable to your use of their site and any information that it may collect.

#### Choice of Law

These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to its conflicts of law provisions. Both parties submit to the personal jurisdiction of and venue in, the state and federal courts sitting in the judicial district that includes Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The parties further agree that any cause of action arising under these Terms shall exclusively be brought in such courts. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. Tufts University's failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.

In addition to this statement, other notices have been published applying to the use and other processing that may be subject to the GDPR of personal data of Prospective Students and Applicants; Students; Students in Tufts-sponsored Study Abroad Programs in the EEA; Job Applicants, Faculty, Staff, Consultants and Other Persons Providing Services; Alumni and Donors; and Research Participants.

The information provided in this statement applies to any of your EEA Personal Data that we may collect, use or otherwise process under the GDPR. An explanation of EEA Personal Data is provided below.

#### 1\. Information associated with tufts.edu and other Tufts Websites

For information associated with a Tufts website, this EEA Privacy Statement should be read together with the Privacy Statement for tufts.edu and other Tufts University websites that have pointed you to that statement (together, a "Site" or "Sites").

The Sites are published in the United States and are subject to the laws of the United States. If you are located in the EEA and you voluntarily submit personal information to us, your information will be used as provided in the Privacy Statement [add link] and in this EEA Privacy Statement and will be transferred to, and/or stored in, the United States.

#### 2\. Why have I been directed to this webpage?

The general information published on this page is intended to supplement specific information that you may have already been given in connection with your engagement with a particular service, facility, event or initiative run by Tufts. You may have been directed here, for example, because you are accessing an optional staff or student service or using a Tufts facility, or because you are using a particular website or online resource, or because you have signed up to attend an event aimed at prospective students or members of the public. The below information is the same for many such situations, and we thought it would be helpful to have it in one place.

#### 3\. What is “EEA Personal Data?”

Your personal information is EEA Personal Data if:

  1. It is “personal data” as defined in the GDPR; and

  2. The GDPR includes protection of the personal data in its scope.




_**What is “personal data” under the GDPR?**_

The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).

**_What is the scope of the GDPR?_**

The GDPR generally applies to collecting, using or other “processing” (please see below) of personal data (as provided in Article 3):

  1. When the processing is part of the activities of an organization that acts in an established way in the EEA. It's not required that the processing take place in the EEA.

  2. When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the organization offers goods or services to persons who are physically in the EEA. A payment for the goods or services is not required.

  3. When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the processing activities are related to the monitoring of the behavior of a person who is physically in the EEA, as far as their behavior takes place within the EEA.




For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or while you participate in an established Tufts program occurring in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.

“Processing” is a term used by the GDPR to cover any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to destroying. GDPR Article 4 (2).

#### 4\. What is the purpose and lawful basis under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data?

It is Tufts' policy to collect, use and process EEA Personal Data about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under the GDPR. A legal basis under the GDPR may be:

  * We need it to perform a contract with you, such as to provide you services.

  * It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to promote and provide goods and services to you and to protect our legal rights and interests.

  * You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.

  * We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.

  * We need to process your data in connection with your or another person's vital interest.

  * We need to process your data in connection with the public interest.

  * We have another legal basis permitted under the GDPR.




If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.

Unless you are told otherwise, there is no requirement to supply us with any of your EEA Personal Data. It is Tufts' policy to not use EEA Personal Data to carry out any automated decision-making that affect you without an appropriate legal basis as required by the GDPR.

_**What are the purposes and lawful bases under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites?**_

Tufts will process your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites for a variety of service- and business-related purposes, including for analyzing and improving website performance; email and other communications; processing you have requested; third-party services; and security and legal requirements.

The use of your EEA Personal Data in the manner described above and in the Privacy Statement are necessary for the legitimate interests of the University in operating and improving its Sites, analyzing their use, and ensuring their security. The Sites collect limited EEA Personal Data and we use it in ways that are compatible with your individual rights and freedoms. Where you enter your EEA Personal Data into an online form on any of our Sites for any specified purpose, you will be told about the use we will make of that information (e.g., to send you newsletters or to enable your attendance at an event).

#### 5\. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?

We will use reasonable measures to ensure that your EEA Personal Data is only transferred to third parties who also maintain at least the standard of protection required under the GDPR.

#### 6\. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?

Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at Records Retention Schedules.

#### 7\. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?

The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR.

  * _The right of access_. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.

  * _The right to correct_. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.

  * _The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)_. The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.

  * _The right to restrict processing_. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.

  * _The right to data portability_. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.

  * _The right to object_. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.




#### 8\. Where can I go if I have questions?

If you have any questions about how your EEA Personal Data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data, please see How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR or contact Tufts' Data Privacy Team at [dataprivacy@tufts.edu](mailto:dataprivacy@tufts.edu).

If you are not happy with the way your EEA Personal Data is being handled, or with the response received from us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the GDPR supervisory authority in the EEA country where you habitually reside, where you work, or where you believe an infringement of the GDPR occurred.

#### 9\. Changes to this Privacy Statement

Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this Privacy Statement at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant. Any such changes will be posted on this page.

This Privacy Statement was last updated on May 25, 2018.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA) provides individuals with rights relating to their EEA Personal Data.

Tufts' EEA Privacy Statement describes what personal information qualifies as EEA Personal Data protected by the GDPR. For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or while you participate in an established Tufts program occurring in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.

The rights provided by the GDPR for EEA Personal Data include:

  * The right of access.
  * The right to correct.
  * The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten).
  * The right to restrict processing.
  * The right to data portability (to move the data to another party).
  * The right to object.



All of these rights are subject to certain exemptions and limitations. More information about these rights may be found in the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and in the EEA Privacy Statement.

Requesting to exercise your rights under the GDPR is known as making a Subject Access Request (sometimes called an SAR). A Subject Access Request form is made available for your convenience. The form sets out where you should send your request and asks that you provide us with proof of your identity.

[Subject Access Request Form [PDF]](https://www.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/SAR_Form.pdf)

Before we can act on your request, we must:

  * Confirm your identity
  * Be supplied with sufficient information from you in order to locate the information you seek.



On receipt of your completed request, verification of your identity, and sufficient details to enable us to locate the information, Tufts is obliged to provide you information on our actions on your request within one month. That period may be extended by two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.

If we determine not to fulfill your request, we are required to notify you within one month of our reasons for not doing so.

As provided in the GDPR, if a person's data requests are clearly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs or decline to act on the requests.

This statement provides information about the use of EEA Personal Data provided by prospective students and applicants for admission to the schools' programs and for financial aid for those programs. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.

#### 1\. What is “EEA Personal Data?”

For purposes of this statement for prospective students and applicants, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide (or arrange to provide) the personal information to us in connection with your interest in our academic programs and/or applying for admission to, or financial aid for, those programs. (In some cases, for purposes of other of Tufts EEA Privacy Statements, EEA Personal Data includes personal information Tufts collects or otherwise processes in the context of our established study abroad programs in the EEA.)

The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR Article 4 (1).

The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4 (2).

#### 2\. Who will process my EEA Personal Data?

The information provided here applies to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure and other processing of your EEA Personal Data by Tufts University and its schools as part of the admissions and financial aid process. The schools assessing your application for admission and for financial aid may provide you with additional statements about how they will collect, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your EEA Personal Data as you progress through the admissions and financial aid process.

For more information about the specific types of personal information we collect and why we do so, please see the following Section 4.

_All Schools - Sensitive Personal Data_

In addition to the personal information referred to above, Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections under the GDPR. This includes information you may provide concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or health/disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain programs of study, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are managed very carefully.

#### 4\. What is the purpose and lawful basis of the processing?

Tufts will use your EEA Personal Data provided on your admission application, the financial aid application, and the other information referred to above for the purposes of answering questions you may have, identifying you, processing your application, verifying the information provided, assessing your candidacy for admission to the programs to which you applied and deciding whether to offer you admission to those programs, assessing your eligibility for financial aid and determining what financial aid will be offered to you, and communicating to you those outcomes. The following table provides additional information about specific types of personal information we collect and otherwise process, the reasons we do so, and which legal bases under the GDPR are applicable.

Your EEA Personal Data will be transferred out of the EEA to the USA, which has different privacy laws than those of the EEA. Tufts has adopted appropriate measures to protect your EEA Personal Data. In most cases, the transfer of your EEA Personal Data is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and Tufts, for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest, or for important reasons in the public interest. In limited circumstances, the transfer may be necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or to protect your vital interests.

#### 5\. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?

Your application and related materials will be shared with the appropriate faculty and staff at Tufts. Each school has developed its own practices for sharing your personal information based on its consideration of the type and sensitivity of the personal information, the purpose for which the information was provided or otherwise collected, the purpose for sharing the personal information, and the safeguards used to protect the shared information. Accordingly, under certain, considered circumstances, and when relevant, your personal information may also be shared with:

  * _Parents, Spouses, and Guardians_. In some cases, we may share your information with a parent, spouse, or guardian if necessary to properly complete the admissions process or in the event of an emergency.
  * _Service Providers._ We may use third parties to support our operations and provide services to our prospective, admitted or enrolled students. In such cases, we may share your information with these third parties.
  * _School Counselors and Administrators._ We may share your information with your school counselors and administrators.
  * _University Affiliated Programs._ We may share your information with third parties that are affiliated with the University for the purpose of contacting you about goods, services, or experiences that may be of interest to you.
  * _Research and Studies._ We may share your information with third parties that study admissions or other topics related to higher education. We may also share your information with third parties that conduct research or develop products or services designed to improve admissions and other higher education functions.
  * _Required by Law._ We may share your information with third parties to the extent we are required to do so by law, court order, or subpoena. In the case of international applicants, we may share your information with appropriate agencies including the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in order to act as your sponsor for visa purposes.
  * _Emergency Circumstances._ We may share your information with a person you have designated as an emergency contact or with other third parties if, in our sole judgment, such disclosure is necessary to protect your health, safety, or property or the health, safety, or property of any other person.
  * _Compelling Purpose._ We may share your information in other cases when there is a compelling purpose regarding benefit to Tufts or members of our community.
  * _De-Identified and Aggregate Information._ We may use and disclose information about our applicants in de-identified or aggregate form without limitation.



#### 6\. How is my EEA Personal Data used if I am admitted and decide to enroll?

If you are accepted and decide to enroll, we will use your personal information for the purposes described at “How is my EEA Personal Data used?” in the EEA Privacy Statement for Students, as amended from time to time. Further information about this will be provided in your offer of admission, and if applicable, your financial aid decision.

If you are accepted and decide to enroll, Tufts will also provide data about you to the National Student Clearinghouse and other external agencies and funding bodies, as required.

#### 7\. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?

We will store your EEA Personal Data for as long as necessary to complete the application process. Some schools store applicant information permanently. If you are admitted, your personal information will normally be kept for at least one year or longer after the completion of the application process, depending on the policy of the school to which you applied. If you are admitted and decide to enroll, your personal information will be kept as part of your student record for the duration of your studies (and it may be used as part of our assessment of any future application you make for further studies at Tufts). Details about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/) and is available from the school to which you applied. Additional information about how long student information may be retained is available in the EEA Privacy Statement for Students.

#### 8\. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?

The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to Make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR.

  * _The right of access_. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.
  * _The right to correct_. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.
  * _The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)_. The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.
  * _The right to restrict processing_. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.
  * _The right to data portability_. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.
  * _The right to object_. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.

#### 1\. What is “EEA Personal Data”?

For purposes of this statement for students, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a student, or your personal information is used or otherwise processed in connection with a university established activity in the EEA.

The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).

The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4 (2).

#### 2\. How does this webpage relate to other information about data protection?

When you applied to become a student, you were told how Tufts would use your EEA Personal Data to process your application and for related purposes (see EEA Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants). You were referred to this webpage for a fuller statement of the uses we make of your EEA Personal Data while you are a student at Tufts.

In addition to the information published here, when you use specific services and facilities offered by Tufts, you may be told about other uses of your EEA Personal Data. For example, there are separate statements for persons who use or engage with Tufts websites (see Privacy Statement), IT services (see [Use of Institutional Systems Policy](https://it.tufts.edu/ispol)), the Counseling and Mental Health service (see [Confidentiality](https://students.tufts.edu/health-and-wellness/counseling-and-mental-health/about-us/confidentiality)), the Office of Equal Opportunity (see <http://oeo.tufts.edu/>), and the libraries (see [Tufts University Libraries Privacy Policy](http://www.library.tufts.edu/privacyPolicy.html)).

Additional information for students participating in Tufts-sponsored study abroad programs in the EEA is available at EEA Privacy Statement for Students in Tufts-Sponsored Study Abroad Programs in the EEA.

#### 3\. Who will process my EEA Personal Data?

The information published here applies to the use, sharing and disclosure of your EEA Personal Data by Tufts University, including its schools, units, centers and other affiliated organizations.

#### 4\. What EEA Personal Data will be processed?

The EEA Personal Data that Tufts keeps a record of may include the EEA Personal Data:

  * you provided in connection with your admission to Tufts, including financial aid applications, (see EEA Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants)
  * included in records about your studies at Tufts
  * included in records about your use of the academic and non-academic facilities and services that we offer.



Among the EEA Personal Data included may be your name, home and local addresses, student identification number, Social Security number or other governmental identification numbers, date of birth, courses taken, fee payments, financial aid provided, and information about your examinations, assessments and results.

Your EEA Personal Data is created, stored and transmitted in a variety of paper and electronic formats, including databases at Tufts (such as the main student records database, or the systems used by Tufts libraries). It is Tufts' policy to limit access to and the use of your EEA Personal Data to Tufts staff, faculty and authorized affiliates who have a legitimate interest in it for the purpose of carrying out their professional and contractual duties.

In addition to this, Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections. This includes information concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, health or disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain programs of study, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.

Tufts' [Non-Discrimination Policy](http://oeo.tufts.edu/policies-procedures/non-discrimination-policy/) “prohibits discrimination against and harassment of any student, employee, applicant for employment, third party or community member because of race; color; national or ethnic origin; age; religion; disability; sex; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity and expression; including a transgender identity; genetics; veteran status; retaliation; and any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law.”

#### 5\. What is the purpose and legal basis of the processing of EEA Personal Data?

Tufts may process your EEA Personal Data for a range of contractual, statutory, or legitimate University interests, or for public interest purposes, including the following:

  * To deliver and administer your education, record the details of your studies (including any placements with external organizations), and determine or confirm your academic achievements (e.g. results, awards).
  * Where relevant, to monitor, evaluate and support your research activity.
  * To administer the financial aspects of your relationship with us and any funders.
  * To deliver services to you (e.g. IT, athletics, libraries, accommodation, careers, housing).
  * To enable your participation at events (e.g. functions, commencement).
  * To communicate effectively with you by mail, email and phone, including the distribution of relevant newsletters and circulars.
  * To operate security, governance, disciplinary (including plagiarism and academic misconduct), complaint, audit and quality assurance processes and arrangements.
  * To support your training, medical, safety, and welfare requirements and your religious, spiritual, ethical, and cultural life.
  * To compile statistics and conduct research for internal, statutory, regulatory and accreditation reporting purposes.
  * To fulfill and monitor our legal obligations under equal opportunity, immigration and public safety laws and regulations, and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
  * To enable us to contact others in the event of an emergency.



We consider the processing of your EEA Personal Data for these purposes to be necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations with you (e.g. to manage your student experience and welfare while studying at a Tufts program in the EEA), or necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (e.g. equal opportunities monitoring), or necessary for the performance of tasks we carry out in the public interest (e.g. teaching and research), or necessary for the pursuit of the legitimate interests of Tufts as an educational and research institution or of an external organization (e.g. to enable your access to external services). If we require your consent for any specific use of your EEA Personal Data, we will collect it at the appropriate time. We will not use your EEA Personal Data to carry out any wholly automated decision-making that affects you.

#### 6\. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?

As described above, your EEA Personal Data may be shared with relevant Tufts staff, faculty and affiliates as required. In addition, it may be shared as permitted or required by law, on a considered and confidential basis, as appropriate, with a range of external organizations, including external examiners and auditors, and external individuals involved in relevant Tufts committees or procedures.

We may also share your EEA Personal Data as relevant with:

  * _Your Funders and Sponsors_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with organizations that may provide you funding or other financial sponsorship.
  * _Parents, Spouses, and Guardians_. In some cases, we may share your EEA Personal Data with a parent, spouse, or guardian if necessary, including in the event of an emergency.
  * _Service Providers_. We may use third parties to support our operations and provide services to our students. In such cases, we may share your EEA Personal Data with such third parties.
  * _University Affiliated Programs_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with third parties that are affiliated with the University for the purpose of contacting you about goods, services, or experiences that may be of interest to you.

  * _Required by Law and/or Governmental Authorities_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with third parties to the extent we are required to do so by law, court order, or subpoena. In the case of international students, we may share your EEA Personal Data with appropriate agencies including the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in order to act as your sponsor for visa purposes. On occasion and when necessary, we may share your EEA Personal Data with local governmental authorities, including the police and other law enforcement bodies, and statutory regulatory bodies.
  * _Emergency Circumstances_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with a person you have designated as an emergency contact or with other third parties if, in our sole judgment, such disclosure is necessary to protect your health, safety, or property or the health, safety, or property of any other person.
  * _Compelling Purpose_. We may share your EEA Personal Data in other cases when there is a compelling purpose regarding benefit to the Tufts or members of our community.
  * _De-Identified and Aggregate Information_. We may use and disclose information about our students in de-identified or aggregate form without limitation.



We will normally confirm details of your results and degrees awarded to external enquirers or organizations, and will provide references to third parties. Your name and the type of degree awarded will be published in the relevant graduation program.

If your EEA Personal Data includes basic contact details, that information may be included in our online directory, though you can choose to limit what information is visible (<https://whitepages.tufts.edu/faq.cgi>). In addition, please see the information provided at the start of this statement with respect to FERPA.

The above types of sharing may involve the transfer of your EEA Personal Data outside the European Economic Area. Such transfers usually are necessary (i) in order to meet our contractual obligations with you or contractual obligations with others that are in your interest, (ii) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, (iii) to protect your vital interest, or (iv) as otherwise permitted by the GDPR. The transfers are carried out with confidentiality and privacy safeguards in place to protect your EEA Personal Data.

#### 7\. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?

We store your EEA Personal Data for the duration of your studies (and it may be used as part of our assessment of any future application you make for further studies at Tufts). Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/).

#### 8\. How is my EEA Personal Data used after I graduate?

Core records for matriculated students are generally retained indefinitely so that the details of your academic achievements can be confirmed and for statistical or historical research. See [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/). Your contact and core personal details are passed to the Office of Alumni Relations while you are still a student so that you can be added to the alumni database. A statement for alumni and donors setting out how their EEA Personal Data is used by Tufts is published at EEA Privacy Statement for Alumni and Donors.

#### 9\. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?

The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR.

  * _The right of access_. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.
  * _The right to correct_. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.
  * _The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)_. The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.
  * _The right to restrict processing_. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.
  * _The right to data portability_. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.
  * _The right to object_. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.



#### 10\. Where can I go if I have questions?

If you have any questions about how your EEA Personal Data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights, please consult the EEA Privacy Statement and How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR. If you need further assistance, please contact Tufts' Data Privacy Team at [dataprivacy@tufts.edu](mailto:dataprivacy@tufts.edu), or your prospective school as appropriate.

The following statement has been prepared to provide notice to research participants whose EEA Personal Data is collected, used or otherwise processed by Tufts University, including its schools. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.

This statement should be read together with the EEA Privacy Statement.

#### 1\. What is “EEA Personal Data”?

For purposes of this statement for participants, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a research participant. The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).

The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4(2).

#### 2\. How does this webpage relate to other information about data protection?

The below information applies to all studies and projects that are conducted by Tufts researchers. In the unlikely event that there is any contradiction between this general information and the specific information that you have already been given, the specific information takes precedence.

In addition to the information published here, when you use specific services and facilities offered by Tufts, you may be told about other uses of your EEA Personal Data.
