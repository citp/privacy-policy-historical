It is Tufts’ policy to hold all personal information you supply in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy law.

#### Information Gathered About You or Your Devices

We collect information when you access one of the Sites and when you subscribe to our email services.

_**Device Information**_

We may collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the Sites such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language or other information of this nature. We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the Sites.

_**Cookies**_

Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer (unless you block them). This may include: which pages you see; how long you stay; what you click on our pages; if you visit the website again; and which country and city you are browsing from. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.

Cookies may be set by an organization other than the Sites. These "third-party cookies" may, for example, originate from websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, Pinterest or other social media services. Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy policy pages of these sites directly. You may disable cookies through your individual browser options. Visit <http://www.aboutcookies.org/> for information on how to do this.

_**Google Analytics**_

One or more of our Sites may also use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to track website statistics. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. We use the information collected to understand how our visitors are using the website and make improvements for a better online experience.

Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions and collects the Internet protocol (IP) address of website visitors in order to provide us a sense of where our visitors come from, but Google Analytics does not report visitors’ actual IP address information to us.

We do not use Google Analytics to track or collect personal information (name, email address, billing information or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information) and we do not associate personal information with web analytics information.

To see the full Google Analytics privacy policy and learn more about their privacy practices, please see [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) and [Google Analytics: Safeguarding Your Data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245).

#### Email Terms

When you give us your email address, we may use it to respond, or to communicate information about the University or its activities. If you do not wish to receive communications from Tufts, please click on the unsubscribe link in the body of the message.

Depending on the context in which you submitted your contact information, your data may be accessible to Tufts and its schools, departments, institutes, centers, and divisions connected to Tufts. It is used and processed for a full range of communications and programs involving academic and administrative departments. These include the following communications and marketing activities (by mail, email and telephone):

  * Sending University publications
  * Promoting our services
  * Notifying you of upcoming events
  * Promoting opportunities



Tools may be used to help us improve the effectiveness of our communications with you, including tracking whether the emails we send are opened and which links are clicked within a message. Lastly, we use data to undertake analysis projects to ensure only effective and relevant communications are sent to you.

If you send us email messages, you should be aware that information disclosed in email may not be secure or encrypted and thus may be available to others. We suggest that you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information in email.

#### How Do We Use Your Information?

We use your IP address to administer our Sites by identifying (1) which parts of a Site are most heavily used, (2) where our users come from (i.e., a referring sign or a search engine, etc.), and (3) which portion of our audience comes from within or outside the Tufts network. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable unless we are required to do so under applicable law or court order or authorized to do so under our policies.

The email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.

To the extent provided, we may use your user information in order to process student, financial aid or job applications, student or employee registrations, and other services and benefits that we provide to our students, employees and other persons.

#### Sites Use by Minors

The Sites are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 13.

#### Will Tufts share my personal information with others?

User information may be shared with third-party partners to the extent necessary for such third parties to provide services to us or to users of our Sites, or provide and improve web services or other communications to users. Any third parties who receive user information for this purpose are prohibited from using or sharing user information for any purpose other than providing services to Tufts or to users.

We may also provide your information to third parties in circumstances where we believe that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others.

#### Personal Information of Persons outside the United States

The Sites are published in the United States and are subject to the laws of the United States. If you are located in a country outside the United States and voluntarily submit personal information to us, your information will be used as provided in this Privacy Statement and will be transferred to, and/or be stored in, the United States.

The European Economic Area (EEA) Privacy Statement also provides information with respect to personal information that may be subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area effective May 25, 2018. That Privacy Statement includes information about the purpose and legal basis under the GDPR for the use and other processing of that personal information, as well as the rights associated with that personal information under the GDPR.

#### Changes to this Privacy Statement

Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this Privacy Statement at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant.

Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. Tufts University’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

## European Economic Area (EEA) Privacy Statements

_Effective starting May 25, 2018_

This EEA Privacy Statement discloses information about the privacy practices with respect to personal data protected under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the EEA. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.

In addition to this statement, other notices have been published applying to the use and other processing that may be subject to the GDPR of personal data of Prospective Students and Applicants; Students; Students in Tufts-sponsored Study Abroad Programs in the EEA; Job Applicants, Faculty, Staff, Consultants and Other Persons Providing Services; Alumni and Donors; and Research Participants.

The information provided in this statement applies to any of your EEA Personal Data that we may collect, use or otherwise process under the GDPR. An explanation of EEA Personal Data is provided below.

#### 1\. Information associated with tufts.edu and other Tufts Websites

For information associated with a Tufts website, this EEA Privacy Statement should be read together with the Privacy Statement for tufts.edu and other Tufts University websites that have pointed you to that statement (together, a "Site" or "Sites").

The Sites are published in the United States and are subject to the laws of the United States. If you are located in the EEA and you voluntarily submit personal information to us, your information will be used as provided in the Privacy Statement [add link] and in this EEA Privacy Statement and will be transferred to, and/or stored in, the United States.

#### 2\. Why have I been directed to this webpage?

The general information published on this page is intended to supplement specific information that you may have already been given in connection with your engagement with a particular service, facility, event or initiative run by Tufts. You may have been directed here, for example, because you are accessing an optional staff or student service or using a Tufts facility, or because you are using a particular website or online resource, or because you have signed up to attend an event aimed at prospective students or members of the public. The below information is the same for many such situations, and we thought it would be helpful to have it in one place.

#### 3\. What is “EEA Personal Data?”

Your personal information is EEA Personal Data if:

  1. It is “personal data” as defined in the GDPR; and

  2. The GDPR includes protection of the personal data in its scope.




_**What is “personal data” under the GDPR?**_

The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).

**_What is the scope of the GDPR?_**

The GDPR generally applies to collecting, using or other “processing” (please see below) of personal data (as provided in Article 3):

  1. When the processing is part of the activities of an organization that acts in an established way in the EEA. It’s not required that the processing take place in the EEA.

  2. When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the organization offers goods or services to persons who are physically in the EEA. A payment for the goods or services is not required.

  3. When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the processing activities are related to the monitoring of the behavior of a person who is physically in the EEA, as far as their behavior takes place within the EEA.




For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or while you participate in an established Tufts program occurring in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.

“Processing” is a term used by the GDPR to cover any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to destroying. GDPR Article 4 (2).

#### 4\. What is the purpose and lawful basis under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data?

It is Tufts’ policy to collect, use and process EEA Personal Data about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under the GDPR. A legal basis under the GDPR may be:

  * We need it to perform a contract with you, such as to provide you services.

  * It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to promote and provide goods and services to you and to protect our legal rights and interests.

  * You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.

  * We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.

  * We need to process your data in connection with your or another person’s vital interest.

  * We need to process your data in connection with the public interest.

  * We have another legal basis permitted under the GDPR.




If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.

Unless you are told otherwise, there is no requirement to supply us with any of your EEA Personal Data. It is Tufts’ policy to not use EEA Personal Data to carry out any automated decision-making that affect you without an appropriate legal basis as required by the GDPR.

_**What are the purposes and lawful bases under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites?**_

Tufts will process your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites for a variety of service- and business-related purposes, including for analyzing and improving website performance; email and other communications; processing you have requested; third-party services; and security and legal requirements.

The use of your EEA Personal Data in the manner described above and in the Privacy Statement are necessary for the legitimate interests of the University in operating and improving its Sites, analyzing their use, and ensuring their security. The Sites collect limited EEA Personal Data and we use it in ways that are compatible with your individual rights and freedoms. Where you enter your EEA Personal Data into an online form on any of our Sites for any specified purpose, you will be told about the use we will make of that information (e.g., to send you newsletters or to enable your attendance at an event).

#### 5\. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?

We will use reasonable measures to ensure that your EEA Personal Data is only transferred to third parties who also maintain at least the standard of protection required under the GDPR.

#### 6\. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?

Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at Records Retention Schedules.

#### 7\. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?

The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR.

  * _The right of access_. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.

  * _The right to correct_. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.

  * _The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)_. The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.

  * _The right to restrict processing_. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.

  * _The right to data portability_. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.

  * _The right to object_. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.




#### 8\. Where can I go if I have questions?

If you have any questions about how your EEA Personal Data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data, please see How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR or contact Tufts' Data Privacy Team at [dataprivacy@tufts.edu](mailto:dataprivacy@tufts.edu).

If you are not happy with the way your EEA Personal Data is being handled, or with the response received from us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the GDPR supervisory authority in the EEA country where you habitually reside, where you work, or where you believe an infringement of the GDPR occurred.

#### 9\. Changes to this Privacy Statement

Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this Privacy Statement at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant. Any such changes will be posted on this page.

This Privacy Statement was last updated on May 25, 2018.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA) provides individuals with rights relating to their EEA Personal Data.

Tufts’ EEA Privacy Statement describes what personal information qualifies as EEA Personal Data protected by the GDPR. For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or while you participate in an established Tufts program occurring in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.

The rights provided by the GDPR for EEA Personal Data include:

  * The right of access.
  * The right to correct.
  * The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten).
  * The right to restrict processing.
  * The right to data portability (to move the data to another party).
  * The right to object.



All of these rights are subject to certain exemptions and limitations. More information about these rights may be found in the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and in the EEA Privacy Statement.

Requesting to exercise your rights under the GDPR is known as making a Subject Access Request (sometimes called an SAR). A Subject Access Request form is made available for your convenience. The form sets out where you should send your request and asks that you provide us with proof of your identity.

[Subject Access Request Form [PDF]](https://www.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/SAR_Form.pdf)

Before we can act on your request, we must:

  * Confirm your identity
  * Be supplied with sufficient information from you in order to locate the information you seek.



On receipt of your completed request, verification of your identity, and sufficient details to enable us to locate the information, Tufts is obliged to provide you information on our actions on your request within one month. That period may be extended by two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.

If we determine not to fulfill your request, we are required to notify you within one month of our reasons for not doing so.

As provided in the GDPR, if a person’s data requests are clearly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs or decline to act on the requests.

This statement provides information about the use of EEA Personal Data provided by prospective students and applicants for admission to the schools’ programs and for financial aid for those programs. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.

This statement should be read together with the EEA Privacy Statement.

#### 1\. What is “EEA Personal Data?”

For purposes of this statement for prospective students and applicants, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with your interest in our academic programs and/or applying for admission to, or financial aid for, those programs.

The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR.

The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4 (2).

#### 2\. Who will process my EEA Personal Data?

The information provided here applies to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure and other processing of your EEA Personal Data by Tufts University and its schools ([www.tufts.edu](http://www.tufts.edu/)) as part of the admissions and financial aid process. The schools assessing your application for admission and for financial aid may provide you with additional statements about how they will collect, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your EEA Personal Data as you progress through the admissions and financial aid process.

#### 3\. What EEA Personal Data will be collected, used or otherwise processed?

_For prospective students and applicants to undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs of the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts:_

Additional information about the collection, use, combining and other processing of your EEA Personal Data is available by contacting the Admissions and Financial Aid offices of each school.

_All Schools._

In addition to the personal information referred to above, Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections under the GDPR. This includes information you may provide concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or health/disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain programs of study, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.

#### 4\. What is the purpose and lawful basis of the processing?

Tufts will use your EEA Personal Data provided on your admission application, the financial aid application, and the other information referred to above for the purposes of answering questions you may have, identifying you, processing your application, verifying the information provided, assessing your candidacy for admission to the programs to which you applied and deciding whether to offer you admission to those programs, assessing your eligibility for financial aid and determining what financial aid will be offered to you, and communicating to you those outcomes.

Additionally, Tufts may use or disclose the information provided for statutory, public interest and other purposes, including:

  * To prevent or detect fraud.
  * To comply with applicable laws and regulations and Tufts’ policies, including but not limited to its non-discrimination policy.
  * To help us to make reasonable accommodations for any disability, as requested by you.
  * To allow for consideration of any future accommodation requirements.
  * To offer and deliver university goods, services, and experiences to you.
  * To help inform and support university and school planning and decision making.
  * To provide information required by governmental and accrediting organizations.
  * To conduct research and statistical analysis. No information that could identify you will be published.



The University considers the processing of your personal information for the above purposes necessary to create a contractual relationship with you (e.g. to assess your application for admission), to comply with a legal obligation (e.g. non-discrimination), or to perform tasks carried out in the public interest (e.g. admissions research), and/or for the purposes of Tufts’ legitimate interests, including providing educational and academic programs. We require you to provide your personal information (except for questions marked as optional) during the admissions and financial aid processes in order to assess your candidacy properly. Admissions and financial aid decisions are not automated.

#### 5\. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?

Your application and related materials will be shared with the appropriate faculty and staff at Tufts. Each school has developed its own practices for sharing your personal information based on its consideration of the type and sensitivity of the personal information, the purpose for which the information was provided or otherwise collected, the purpose for sharing the personal information, and the safeguards used to protect the shared information. Accordingly, under certain, considered circumstances, and when relevant, your personal information may also be shared with:

  * _Parents, Spouses, and Guardians_. In some cases, we may share your information with a parent, spouse, or guardian if necessary to properly complete the admissions process or in the event of an emergency.
  * _Service Providers._ We may use third parties to support our operations and provide services to our students. In such cases, we may share your information with these third parties.
  * _School Counselors and Administrators._ We may share your information with your school counselors and administrators.
  * _University Affiliated Programs._ We may share your information with third parties that are affiliated with the University for the purpose of contacting you about goods, services, or experiences that may be of interest to you.
  * _Research and Studies._ We may share your information with third parties that study admissions or other topics related to higher education. We may also share your information with third parties that conduct research or develop products or services designed to improve admissions and other higher education functions.
  * _Required by Law._ We may share your information with third parties to the extent we are required to do so by law, court order, or subpoena. In the case of international applicants, we may share your information with appropriate agencies including the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in order to act as your sponsor for visa purposes.
  * _Emergency Circumstances._ We may share your information with a person you have designated as an emergency contact or with other third parties if, in our sole judgment, such disclosure is necessary to protect your health, safety, or property or the health, safety, or property of any other person.
  * _Compelling Purpose._ We may share your information in other cases when there is a compelling purpose regarding benefit to Tufts or members of our community.
  * _De-Identified and Aggregate Information._ We may use and disclose information about our applicants in de-identified or aggregate form without limitation.



#### 6\. How is my EEA Personal Data used if I am admitted and decide to enroll?

If you are accepted and decide to enroll, we will use your personal information for the purposes described at How is my EEA Personal Data used? in the EEA Privacy Statement for Students as amended from time to time. Further information about this will be provided in your offer of admission, and if applicable, your financial aid decision.

If you are accepted and decide to enroll, Tufts will also provide data about you to the National Student Clearinghouse and other external agencies and funding bodies, as required.

#### 7\. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?

We will store your EEA Personal Data for as long as necessary to complete the application process. Some schools store applicant information permanently. If you are admitted, your personal information will normally be kept for at least one year or longer after the completion of the application process, depending on the policy of the school to which you applied. If you are admitted and decide to enroll, your personal information will be kept as part of your student record for the duration of your studies (and it may be used as part of our assessment of any future application you make for further studies at Tufts). Details about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/) and is available from the school to which you applied. Additional information about how long student information may be retained is available in the EEA Privacy Statement for Students.

#### 8\. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?

The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR.

  * _The right of access_. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.
  * _The right to correct_. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.
  * _The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)_. The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.
  * _The right to restrict processing_. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.
  * _The right to data portability_. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.
  * _The right to object_. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.



#### 9\. Where can I go if I have questions?

If you have any questions about how your EEA Personal Data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights, please consult the EEA Privacy Statement and How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR. If you need further assistance, please contact Tufts’ Data Privacy Team at [dataprivacy@tufts.edu](mailto:dataprivacy@tufts.edu), or your prospective school as appropriate.

If you are not happy with the way your EEA Personal Data is being handled, or with the response received from us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the GDPR supervisory authority in the EEA country where you habitually reside, where you work, or where you believe an infringement of the GDPR occurred.

#### 10\. Changes to this Privacy Statement

Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this Privacy Statement at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant. Any such changes will be posted on this page.

The following statement has been prepared to provide notice to students whose EEA Personal Data is collected, used or otherwise processed by Tufts University, including its schools, while they are students at Tufts. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.

This statement should be read together with the EEA Privacy Statement.

In addition to the information provided in this statement, students are encouraged to review the information about the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for their school. FERPA permits the disclosure of certain personal information classified by a school as “directory” information. See [School of Arts and Sciences and School of Engineering FERPA Notice](http://students.tufts.edu/registrar/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa); [The Fletcher School FERPA Notice](http://fletcher.tufts.edu/~/media/Fletcher/Student%20Handbook/Student%20Handbook%202016-2017%20updated%20Jan%202017.pdf); [Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine FERPA Notice](http://vet.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017-2018-Student-Handbook.pdf); [Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy FERPA Notice](https://nutrition.tufts.edu/about/policies-and-procedures/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act); [School of Dental Medicine FERPA Notice](https://dental.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Student%20Handbook%202017-18.pdf); [Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences FERPA Notice](https://sackler.tufts.edu/studentLife/currentStudents/FERPA); and [School of Medicine FERPA Notice](http://medicine.tufts.edu/About-Us/Policies-and-Reports/FERPA). Privacy Blocks are available to students who wish to prevent the University from disclosing their directory information (in student directories and commencement programs, for example) by selecting the appropriate privacy settings through SIS (<http://go.tufts.edu/sis>).

#### 1\. What is “EEA Personal Data”?

For purposes of this statement for students, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a student, or your personal information is used or otherwise processed in connection with a university established activity in the EEA.

The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).

The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4 (2).

#### 2\. How does this webpage relate to other information about data protection?

When you applied to become a student, you were told how Tufts would use your EEA Personal Data to process your application and for related purposes (see EEA Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants). You were referred to this webpage for a fuller statement of the uses we make of your EEA Personal Data while you are a student at Tufts.

In addition to the information published here, when you use specific services and facilities offered by Tufts, you may be told about other uses of your EEA Personal Data. For example, there are separate statements for persons who use or engage with Tufts websites (see Privacy Statement), IT services (see [Use of Institutional Systems Policy](https://it.tufts.edu/ispol)), the Counseling and Mental Health service (see [Confidentiality](https://students.tufts.edu/health-and-wellness/counseling-and-mental-health/about-us/confidentiality)), the Office of Equal Opportunity (see <http://oeo.tufts.edu/>), and the libraries (see [Tufts University Libraries Privacy Policy](http://www.library.tufts.edu/privacyPolicy.html)).

Additional information for students participating in Tufts-sponsored study abroad programs in the EEA is available at EEA Privacy Statement for Students in Tufts-Sponsored Study Abroad Programs in the EEA.

#### 3\. Who will process my EEA Personal Data?

The information published here applies to the use, sharing and disclosure of your EEA Personal Data by Tufts University, including its schools, units, centers and other affiliated organizations.

#### 4\. What EEA Personal Data will be processed?

The EEA Personal Data that Tufts keeps a record of may include the EEA Personal Data:

  * you provided in connection with your admission to Tufts, including financial aid applications, (see EEA Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants)
  * included in records about your studies at Tufts
  * included in records about your use of the academic and non-academic facilities and services that we offer.



Among the EEA Personal Data included may be your name, home and local addresses, student identification number, Social Security number or other governmental identification numbers, date of birth, courses taken, fee payments, financial aid provided, and information about your examinations, assessments and results.

Your EEA Personal Data is created, stored and transmitted in a variety of paper and electronic formats, including databases at Tufts (such as the main student records database, or the systems used by Tufts libraries). It is Tufts’ policy to limit access to and the use of your EEA Personal Data to Tufts staff, faculty and authorized affiliates who have a legitimate interest in it for the purpose of carrying out their professional and contractual duties.

In addition to this, Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections. This includes information concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, health or disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain programs of study, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.

Tufts’ [Non-Discrimination Policy](http://oeo.tufts.edu/policies-procedures/non-discrimination-policy/) “prohibits discrimination against and harassment of any student, employee, applicant for employment, third party or community member because of race; color; national or ethnic origin; age; religion; disability; sex; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity and expression; including a transgender identity; genetics; veteran status; retaliation; and any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law.”

#### 5\. What is the purpose and legal basis of the processing of EEA Personal Data?

Tufts may process your EEA Personal Data for a range of contractual, statutory, or legitimate University interests, or for public interest purposes, including the following:

  * Where relevant, to monitor, evaluate and support your research activity.
  * To administer the financial aspects of your relationship with us and any funders.
  * To deliver services to you (e.g. IT, athletics, libraries, accommodation, careers, housing).
  * To enable your participation at events (e.g. functions, commencement).
  * To communicate effectively with you by mail, email and phone, including the distribution of relevant newsletters and circulars.
  * To operate security, governance, disciplinary (including plagiarism and academic misconduct), complaint, audit and quality assurance processes and arrangements.
  * To support your training, medical, safety, and welfare requirements and your religious, spiritual, ethical, and cultural life.
  * To compile statistics and conduct research for internal, statutory, regulatory and accreditation reporting purposes.
  * To fulfil and monitor our legal obligations under equal opportunity, immigration and public safety laws and regulations, and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
  * To enable us to contact others in the event of an emergency.



We consider the processing of your EEA Personal Data for these purposes to be necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations with you (e.g. to manage your student experience and welfare while studying at a Tufts program in the EEA), or necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (e.g. equal opportunities monitoring), or necessary for the performance of tasks we carry out in the public interest (e.g. teaching and research), or necessary for the pursuit of the legitimate interests of Tufts as an educational and research institution or of an external organization (e.g. to enable your access to external services). If we require your consent for any specific use of your EEA Personal Data, we will collect it at the appropriate time. We will not use your EEA Personal Data to carry out any wholly automated decision-making that affects you.

#### 6\. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?

As described above, your EEA Personal Data may be shared with relevant Tufts staff, faculty and affiliates as required. In addition, it may be shared as permitted or required by law, on a considered and confidential basis, as appropriate, with a range of external organizations, including external examiners and auditors, and external individuals involved in relevant Tufts committees or procedures.

We may also share your EEA Personal Data as relevant with:

  * _Your Funders and Sponsors_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with organizations that may provide you funding or other financial sponsorship.

  * _Compelling Purpose_. We may share your EEA Personal Data in other cases when there is a compelling purpose regarding benefit to the Tufts or members of our community.
  * _De-Identified and Aggregate Information_. We may use and disclose information about our students in de-identified or aggregate form without limitation.

If your EEA Personal Data includes basic contact details, that information may be included in our online directory, though you can choose to limit what information is visible (<https://whitepages.tufts.edu/faq.cgi>). In addition, please see the information provided at the start of this statement with respect to FERPA.

The above types of sharing may involve the transfer of your EEA Personal Data outside the European Economic Area. Such transfers usually are necessary (i) in order to meet our contractual obligations with you or contractual obligations with others that are in your interest, (ii) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, (iii) to protect your vital interest, or (iv) as otherwise permitted by the GDPR. The transfers are carried out with confidentiality and privacy safeguards in place to protect your EEA Personal Data.

#### 7\. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?

We store your EEA Personal Data for the duration of your studies (and it may be used as part of our assessment of any future application you make for further studies at Tufts). Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/).

#### 8\. How is my EEA Personal Data used after I graduate?

Core records for matriculated students are generally retained indefinitely so that the details of your academic achievements can be confirmed and for statistical or historical research. See [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/). Your contact and core personal details are passed to the Office of Alumni Relations while you are still a student so that you can be added to the alumni database. A statement for alumni and donors setting out how their EEA Personal Data is used by Tufts is published at EEA Privacy Statement for Alumni and Donors.

This includes information concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or health/disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain programs of study, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.

Tufts’ [Non-Discrimination Policy](http://oeo.tufts.edu/policies-procedures/non-discrimination-policy/) “prohibits discrimination against and harassment of any student, employee, applicant for employment, third party or community member because of race; color; national or ethnic origin; age; religion; disability; sex; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity and expression; including a transgender identity; genetics; veteran status; retaliation; and any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law.”

#### 6\. What is the purpose and legal basis of the processing of EEA Personal Data?

Tufts may process your EEA Personal Data for a range of contractual, statutory, or legitimate University interests, or for public interest purposes, including the following:

  * To deliver and administer your education as part of the program, record the details of your studies (including any placements with external organizations), and determine/confirm your academic achievements (e.g. results, awards).
  * To administer the financial aspects of your relationship with us and any funders.
  * To deliver services to you (e.g. IT, accommodation, careers, housing, field trips).
  * To enable your participation at events.
  * To communicate effectively with you by mail, email and phone, including the distribution of relevant program information and updates, newsletters and brochures.
  * To operate security, governance, disciplinary (including plagiarism and academic misconduct), complaint, audit and quality assurance processes and arrangements.
  * To support your training, medical, safety, welfare requirements and your religious, spiritual, ethical, and cultural life.
  * To compile statistics and conduct research for internal, statutory, regulatory and accreditation reporting purposes.
  * To fulfil and monitor our legal obligations under equal opportunity, immigration and public safety laws and regulations, and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
  * To enable us to contact others in the event of an emergency.



We consider the processing of your EEA Personal Data for these purposes to be necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations with you (e.g. to manage your student experience and welfare while studying at a Tufts-sponsored program in the EEA), or necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (e.g. equal opportunities monitoring), or necessary for the performance of tasks we carry out in the public interest (e.g. teaching and research), or necessary for the pursuit of the legitimate interests of Tufts as an educational and research institution or an external organization (e.g. to enable your access to external services). If we require your consent for any specific use of your EEA Personal Data, we will collect it at the appropriate time. We will not use your EEA Personal Data to carry out any wholly automated decision-making that affects you.

#### 7\. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?

As described above, your EEA Personal Data may be shared with relevant Tufts staff, faculty and affiliates as required. In addition, it may be shared as permitted or required by law, on a considered and confidential basis, as appropriate, with a range of external organizations, including external examiners and auditors, and external individuals involved in relevant Tufts committees or procedures.

We may also share your EEA Personal Data as relevant with:

  * _Affiliated Universities and Colleges_. If the Tufts-sponsored program is affiliated with a university or college in the EEA, we will share EEA Personal Data with the staff and faculty of that university or college as part of providing courses and other educational offerings and experiences to you.
  * _Host Families_. If you will be residing with a host family, some of your EEA Personal Data will be shared with them, including your name, contact information, and other information that will be helpful for the family to provide you with a positive experience in their home.
  * _Your Funders and Sponsors_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with organizations that may provide you funding or other financial sponsorship.
  * _Parents, Spouses, and Guardians_. In some cases, we may share your EEA Personal Data with a parent, spouse, or guardian if necessary, including in the event of an emergency.
  * _Service Providers_. We may use third parties to support our operations and provide services to our students. In such cases, we may share your EEA Personal Data with such third parties.
  * _University Affiliated Programs_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with third parties that are affiliated with the University for the purpose of contacting you about goods, services, or experiences that may be of interest to you. These may include the providers of any external/collaborative learning and training placements or fieldwork opportunities.
  * _Student Organizations_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with student clubs and other organizations in order to facilitate your knowledge of those groups.
  * _Research and Studies_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with third parties that study topics related to higher education. We may also share your EEA Personal Data with third parties that conduct research or develop products or services designed to improve higher education functions.
  * _Higher Education Organizations_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with the National Student Clearinghouse and other relevant higher education organizations.
  * _Required by Law and/or Governmental Authorities_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with third parties to the extent we are required to do so by law, court order, or subpoena. In the case of international students, we may share your EEA Personal Data with appropriate agencies including the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in order to act as your sponsor for visa purposes. On occasion and when necessary, we may share your EEA Personal Data with local governmental authorities, including the police and other law enforcement bodies, and statutory regulatory bodies.
  * _Emergency Circumstances_. We may share your EEA Personal Data with a person you have designated as an emergency contact or with other third parties if, in our sole judgment, such disclosure is necessary to protect your health, safety, or property or the health, safety, or property of any other person.



We will normally confirm details of your results and degrees awarded to external enquirers or organizations, and will provide references to third parties.

The above types of sharing may involve the transfer of your EEA Personal Data outside the European Economic Area. Such transfers usually are necessary (i) in order to meet our contractual obligations with you or contractual obligations with others that are in your interest, (ii) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, (iii) to protect your vital interest, or (iv) as otherwise permitted by the GDPR. The transfers are carried out with confidentiality and privacy safeguards in place to protect your EEA Personal Data.

#### 8\. How is my EEA Personal Data used after I graduate?

Core records for students are generally retained indefinitely for statistical or historical research and so that the details of your academic achievements can be confirmed. See [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/).

#### 9\. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?

We store your EEA Personal Data for the duration of your studies (and it may be used as part of our assessment of any future application you make for further studies at Tufts). Generally, student records for matriculated students are retained permanently. Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/).

#### 10\. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?

The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR.

  * _The right of access_. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.
  * _The right to correct_. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.
  * _The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)_. The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.
  * _The right to restrict processing_. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.
  * _The right to data portability_. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.
  * _The right to object_. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.



#### 11\. Where can I go if I have questions?

If you have any questions about how your EEA Personal Data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights, please consult the EEA Privacy Statement and How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR. If you need further assistance, please contact Tufts’ Data Privacy Team at [dataprivacy@tufts.edu](mailto:dataprivacy@tufts.edu).

If you are not happy with the way your EEA Personal Data is being handled, or with the response received from us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the GDPR supervisory authority in the EEA country where you habitually reside or where you believe an infringement of the GDPR occurred.

#### 12\. Changes to this Privacy Statement

Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this Privacy Statement at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant. Any such changes will be posted on this page.

The following statement has been prepared to provide notice to job applicants, faculty, staff, consultants and other persons providing services whose EEA Personal Data is collected, used or otherwise processed by Tufts University. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.

This statement should be read together with the EEA Privacy Statement.

Specific sections are as follows:

I. For job applicants:

II. Supplement for job applicants undergoing background checks (e.g. criminal records, security, visas):

III. For faculty, staff, consultants, and other persons providing services:

IV. General Information, including your GDPR rights and where you can get answers to your questions

This statement discloses the privacy practices for the EEA Personal Data of faculty, staff, consultants, and people who apply for jobs or positions with us. Please read these terms together with the [Tufts University Privacy Statement](https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy), the EEA Privacy Statement, and the [Statement on Personnel Records](https://access.tufts.edu/personnel-records).

#### What is “EEA Personal Data?”

For purposes of this statement for job applicants, faculty, staff, consultants and other persons providing services, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a job applicant, faculty, staff, consultant or other person providing services.

The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).

The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR. Article 4(2).

For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or when you are providing services on behalf of Tufts in the EEA, or if your personal information is used or otherwise processed in connection with a university established activity in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.

#### I. Job Applicants

#### 5\. What EEA Personal Data will be processed?

Tufts will use the details you provide on your application form, together with the supporting documents requested and additional details provided by any persons submitting letters of recommendation, and information recorded following any interview process.

If you are required to undergo certain background checks or procedures as part of the job application and offer process (e.g. criminal convictions checks or visa application procedures), we will use this information as described at Background Checks Data.

#### 6\. What is the purpose and lawful basis of the processing?

Tufts will process the EEA Personal Data provided on your application and the other information referred to above for the purposes of identifying you, processing your application, verifying the information provided and assessing your suitability for the role, deciding whether to offer you a job or position, and communicating that outcome.

We may also use or disclose the information provided for the following statutory or public interest purposes:

  * To provide information required by governmental and accrediting organizations.
  * For research and statistical purposes.



We consider the processing of your EEA Personal Data for the above purposes to be either necessary for us to take steps with a view to considering your employment application, or necessary for compliance with a legal obligation (e.g. non-discrimination), or necessary for the performance of tasks we carry out in the public interest (e.g. reporting or research). We require you to provide us with the information we ask for during the application process in order to assess your application properly except where its supply is marked as optional. Applications decisions are not automated.

#### 7\. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?

As well as circulating your application and related materials to the appropriate hiring staff, reviewers, and interviewers at Tufts, we will share your EEA Personal Data for the above purposes as relevant and necessary with:

  * _Recommendations_. In checking your references, we may share your information with persons submitting letters of recommendation. For most staff applications, Tufts contracts with a third-party service that solicits information from references on an anonymous basis.

If you receive an offer of employment and you accept it, we will use your EEA Personal Data for the purposes described at Faculty, Staff, Consultants and Other Persons Providing Services, as amended from time to time.

#### 9\. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?

We store your EEA Personal Data for as long as necessary to complete the application process. Your EEA Personal Data may also be used as part of our assessment of any future application you make for further employment or engagement at Tufts. If you are offered a position and accept that position, your information will normally be kept as part of your personnel record for the duration of your employment plus six years or permanently for faculty. After you leave, certain records pertaining to your employment or engagement are retained indefinitely so that the details of your employment or engagement can be confirmed and for statistical or historical research. If you are not offered a position, your information will normally be kept for six years after the completion of the application process. Currently, Taleo retains information submitted to it indefinitely. Other information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/).

In addition, if you apply for a faculty appointment, the school may also retain records including your EEA Personal Data in accordance with the policy adopted by the school(s) and administered by each faculty affairs office.

#### II. Background Check Data

This page describes how your EEA Personal Data is used and stored if you are required to undergo certain background checks or procedures as part of the application and offer process. It supplements the general information about how we use your EEA Personal Data as an applicant for a position (see Job Applicants). The checks and procedures covered by this section include basic background checks, including verification of education and prior employment, CORI reports, security clearance checks, any application for immigration purposes including where visa sponsorship is required, and similar processes that will only affect some applicants, whether because of the type of position you are applying for or because of your individual status. The sensitive information that may be processed may include information about past criminal convictions, including sex offender convictions, motor vehicle records, and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. If any of these checks affect you, we will make this clear to you at the relevant point in the application process.

In all cases, we will only use any information gathered as part of any relevant check or procedure for that specific purpose, and it is our policy to handle, store, retain and destroy relevant materials in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and standards of practice. This means that access to any relevant materials (including any forms completed by Tufts) is strictly controlled. We retain the results of the relevant checks. We will only share any relevant information with external parties insofar as we are required to do so or doing so is necessary (this may include partner organizations or employers and third party vendors who provide associated services).

#### III. Faculty, Staff, Consultants and Other Persons Providing Services

#### 1\. How We Use Your EEA Personal Data

This section provides information about the use of EEA Personal Data while you are a member of faculty, staff, consultant, or other person providing services at Tufts University. Tufts University respects the privacy of its employees and other persons providing services and strives to keep its personnel files confidential. The Human Resources Department maintains a personnel file for each employee. See [Statement on Personnel Records](https://access.tufts.edu/personnel-records).

As a member of faculty, staff, consultant or other person providing services at Tufts, you also have certain legal responsibilities to protect the EEA Personal Data of other people (e.g. other employees, students, research participants) by handling it appropriately; relevant policies and guidance on the University’s policy on handling EEA Personal Data are available at the [Tufts University Privacy Statement](https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy) and the EEA Privacy Statement.

We will maintain various administrative, including financial, records, about your employment or engagement at Tufts, and about your use of the academic and non-academic facilities and services that we offer. Where relevant, we may supplement these records with personal data from the public domain (e.g. your publications) or other sources.

Your EEA Personal Data is created, stored and transmitted securely in a variety of paper and electronic formats, including some databases at Tufts (such as the systems used by Human Resources and Tufts Support Services). It is Tufts’ policy to limit access to your EEA Personal Data to staff and others who have a legitimate interest in it for the purpose of carrying out their duties.

In addition to this, Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections. This includes information concerning your race or ethnicity, health or disability that we use for providing employment benefits, planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain positions, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.

Tufts’ [Non-Discrimination Policy](http://oeo.tufts.edu/policies-procedures/non-discrimination-policy/) “prohibits discrimination against and harassment of any student, employee, applicant for employment, third party or community member because of race; color; national or ethnic origin; age; religion; disability; sex; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity and expression; including a transgender identity; genetics; veteran status; retaliation; and any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law.”

  * To support your training, health, safety, and welfare requirements.

  * Companies or organizations providing specific services to, or on behalf of, Tufts.



Our policy is to provide limited information about you to external enquirers or organizations to verify employment dates and job title, and, if the person requesting the information already has the information, to confirm salary.

We will include your basic contact details in our online directory (<https://whitepages.tufts.edu/>). If your EEA Personal Data includes basic contact details, that information may be included in our online directory, though you can choose to limit what information is visible (<https://whitepages.tufts.edu/faq.cgi>). Some departments may expect faculty and staff to maintain a publicly available personal profile or webpage. Some information about Tufts officers, faculty and other staff (e.g. appointments or committee memberships) is published in _Tufts Now, Tufts Announcements, Tufts magazines, brochures, and newsletters, press releases, social media accounts, and other Tufts communications_.

The above types of sharing may involve the transfer of your EEA Personal Data collected or otherwise processed in the European Economic Area to outside the European Economic Area. Such transfers usually are necessary (i) if a contractual relationship exists, in order to meet our contractual obligations with you, or contractual obligations with others that are in your interest; (ii) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; (iii) to protect your vital interest; or (iv) as otherwise permitted by the GDPR. The transfers are carried out with confidentiality and privacy safeguards in place to protect your EEA Personal Data.

#### 7\. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?

Your EEA Personal Data will normally be kept as part of your personnel record for the duration of your employment or other engagement plus six years for staff and permanently for faculty. Your EEA Personal Data may also be used as part of our assessment of any future application you make for further employment or engagement at Tufts.

This Statement explains how Tufts handles and uses the EEA Personal Data we collect about our alumni and our past, current and future supporters, whether donors, volunteers or participants in membership groups that we run. “Tufts” in this context means the central university, our individual schools, departments and research institutes, and the libraries and other cultural and recreational facilities that we operate. Developing a better understanding of our alumni and donors allows us to keep in touch with you, in order to keep you apprised of our activities and developments, to provide services to you, and to identify ways in which you can support us, through donations or other forms of financial and non-financial support.

#### 1\. What is “EEA Personal Data”?

For purposes of this statement for alumni and donors, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us. in connection with being an alumnus or donor.

The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).

The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR. Article 4(2).

For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.

#### 2\. EEA Personal Data held by Tufts

We may hold information relating to you from a number of sources. A significant proportion of the EEA Personal Data we hold on alumni and donors is provided to us directly (for example, an alumnus may give us information by filling in forms on the Tufts website, or by corresponding with us by telephone, email or otherwise). If you are a student or studied at Tufts, some of your personal information is transferred from your student record to Tufts University Advancement databases.

The information we hold about you may or may not be EEA Personal Data within the scope of the GDPR.

Among the information records may contain are:

  * details of your education (e.g. your school(s), areas of study, dates of study)
  * unique personal identifiers and biographical information (e.g. student number, date of birth)
  * your contact details (and we update these whenever you let us know that they have changed)
  * details of your interactions with Tufts, including: 
    * your membership of clubs, societies, and alumni groups
    * your attendance at Tufts events
    * other contact with us or our partners
    * your relationships with other Tufts alumni or donors
  * details about your family (e.g. your marital status, the name of your partner or spouse)
  * personal data provided by you for a specific purpose (e.g. disability and dietary preferences for event management purposes)
  * your communication preferences, to help us provide tailored and relevant communications



We also record, where applicable, based on information that you provide to us and, in some cases, publicly available information and information from our partners:

  * financial information relating to you and your family, including: 
    * your history of donations made to Tufts
    * your ability and willingness to make donations, including our assessment of your income and whether particular donations or funding appeals may be of interest to you
    * your philanthropy and other giving, including donations to other organizations and other support that you provide (e.g. details of volunteering roles)
  * your career highlights and other life achievements
  * information about your areas of interest and extra-curricular activities



We augment the data we hold from Tufts with data from our collaborators and publicly available data. We use targeted internet searches and may search the following (either directly or using search engines), where relevant in order to obtain and maintain the accuracy of the data listed above:

  * Public sources for companies (in order to find personal data of those companies' employees, etc.), including company websites
  * Public sources for charities (in order to find personal data of those charities' employees, trustees, etc., and to find information about donations and support)
  * Public sources for individuals
  * Press sources



In addition to this, Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category,” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections. This may include information concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious beliefs or health/disability that we use for planning purposes, or in order to provide help or suitable assistance. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.

#### 3\. How your EEA Personal Data is used by Tufts

We may use automated or manual analyses to link EEA Personal Data together to help us identify your potential for supporting Tufts, to provide you with an improved experience, to send you communications which are relevant and timely, to identify volunteering opportunities or opportunities for providing support which may be of interest to you, and to avoid approaching you with opportunities which are not of interest. All of this enables us to raise more funds, sooner, and more cost-effectively, in support of Tufts’ strategic research and teaching objectives. We always seek to ensure that any opportunities we present are aligned with your interests, based on the research we conduct.

Your EEA Personal Data is used by us for a number of interdependent purposes in support of alumni relations, communications and fundraising. These include:

  * sending you publications, alumni magazines, and news and updates about Tufts
  * conducting surveys, including research on when and whether particular donations or funding appeals may be of interest to you
  * providing services, including access to Tufts facilities and alumni and donor email accounts
  * providing an alumni directory within the password-protected Tufts University Online community
  * sending you information about giving opportunities, tailored proposals, appeals and requests for donations
  * sending you details of volunteering opportunities
  * inviting you to alumni, donor, and other Tufts events
  * the promotion of other opportunities and services available to you (e.g. offers and opportunities available through Tufts’ network of alumni and donor groups)
  * wealth analysis and research in order to improve our understanding of our alumni and donors, inform our fundraising strategy and target our communications more effectively
  * internal record keeping, including the management of any feedback or complaints
  * administrative purposes (e.g. in order to process a donation you have made or to administer an event you have registered for or attended)



The Tufts University Alumni Association and the Tufts University Advancement Division has also occasionally approved sharing alumni and donor data with companies and institutions that desire to offer services and benefits to Tufts alumni and donors at a discounted rate. Any third parties who receive alumni and donor data for this purpose are prohibited from using or sharing the data for any purpose other than providing services to Tufts or to its alumni and donors.

Communications to you may be sent by mail, telephone or electronic means, depending on the contact details we hold and the preferences expressed by you about the types of communications you wish to receive. Alumni may at any time opt-out of receiving all emails from the alumni association, or just emails from companies and institutions offering services and benefits to alumni, by clicking on the "update your email subscription preferences" link in emails and following the specified instructions, or by calling 1-800-THE-ALUM (1-800-843-2586) or 617-627-3532, by faxing a request to 617-627-3938, or by mailing a request to Tufts University Alumni Association, 80 George St., Ste. 100-3, Medford, MA 02155.

The lawful basis for processing your EEA Personal Data under the GDPR include being necessary for the pursuit of our legitimate interests, the carrying out of a task in the public interest, and in some instances, the performance of a contract. We always endeavor to handle your EEA Personal Data securely and minimize its use.

#### 5\. How we protect your EEA Personal Data

It is Tufts’ policy to have appropriate data sharing agreements in place before sharing your EEA Personal Data.

We do not sell your EEA Personal Data to third parties under any circumstances, or permit third parties to sell the EEA Personal Data we have shared with them. In addition, it is Tufts policy to prohibit any third party (except those selected by the Tufts University Alumni Association and University Advancement) from using alumni or donor data for any commercial or business marketing.

The above types of sharing may involve the transfer of your EEA Personal Data outside the European Economic Area. Such transfers usually are necessary (i) in order to meet our contractual obligations with you or contractual obligations with others that are in your interest, (ii) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, (iii) to protect your vital interest, or (iv) as otherwise permitted by the GDPR. The transfers are carried out with confidentiality and privacy safeguards in place to protect your EEA Personal Data.

We will retain your EEA Personal Data indefinitely in support of your lifelong relationship with Tufts or until you request us to do otherwise. Further information about Tufts’ record retention practices can be found at our [Records Retention Schedule](https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/).
