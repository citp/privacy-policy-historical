Current policy effective as of Jul 15, 2019

This Tuft & Needle Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to our website, www.tuftandneedle.com, and any other digital properties (collectively, the “Site”) operated by Fosbrooke, Inc. dba Tuft & Needle (“T&N”, "our", “we”, or “us”). If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. The Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into the [Terms & Conditions of Service](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms) (the “Terms”).

We will notify you of any material changes by posting a notice on the Site and/or by sending you an email at the email address we have on file for you. You may wish to review the Privacy Policy regularly to see whether it has changed, as your continued use of the Site following a posted update will signify your acceptance of the Privacy Policy, as posted.

## II. Purpose of this Privacy Policy

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about how T&N collects, uses, and discloses the information collected from and about you and other users of the Site.

* * *

## III. Definitions

The following definitions apply when these terms are used in the Privacy Policy. If a term is not defined in Privacy Policy, it may be defined in the Terms.

“IP Address” refers to “Internet Protocol Address” and means the unique number that allows computers attached to the Internet to know where to send you data (such as the webpages you view) and where the data that you are sending is coming from.

“Personal Information” means information that, alone or when in combination with other information, identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked to, directly or indirectly, a person or household. Your Personal Information includes, without limitation, your name, address, email address, phone number, IP address, cookie IDs, and device identifiers. Your Personal Information does not include information that we obtain in or transform into an anonymous format from which a third party cannot identify you. However, if we collect Non-personal Information and link it to your full name or other type of Personal Information, the combination of this data would be “Personal Information.”

“Non-Personal Information” means information that does not identify you as a specific individual, including without limitation anonymous usage statistics including frequency of messaging and interaction with other users, clickstream data other log file data, or social analytics and tracking measurements. We may link your Non-Personal Information to your Personal Information which, in combination, would become, and would be treated as, Personal Information.

“Aggregate Data” means Non-Personal Information that we collect about a group or category of customers or Products. Aggregate data helps us to understand trends so that we can better consider new Products and services, analyze usage, facilitate payments, or otherwise improve or tailor our offerings. For example, we may collect data about the shopping habits of residents of a particular state (without linking this data to any specific Personal Information about those residents).

To "use" or to "process" information means to handle or utilize the information in any way, including without limitation by subjecting the information to statistical or other evaluation or analysis, or by collecting, storing, modifying, deleting, combining the information (including by using cookies on a computer), or by disclosing and/or transferring the information within our company or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.

  * _Demographic Information:_ We may collect demographic information such as age, gender, city, state, and country.
  * _Usage Information_ : We may collect data about how you and your devices interact with the Site and our related services.

## V. How We Collect Your Information

We will ask you to provide us with certain Personal Information when you purchase a Product from the Site or when you communicate with us about a Product that you have purchased from us. When you make a payment for a Product that you purchase via the Site, you will likely need to provide Personal Information to our third party service providers (i.e., payment processors), such as your credit card number.

## VI. Cookies and Other Similar Technologies

Cookies. A cookie is a small text or data file that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and is stored on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting but allow you to block, delete, or pre-approve cookies. However, if you do that, certain websites, including our Site may not work fully or properly (e.g., you may not be able to access or use certain pages, features, or functionality). Some of the cookies that we use may be flash cookies/Adobe cookies, which are more persistent in nature. These cookies may not be deleted when your cookies are deleted. If you are interested in learning more about this, you should check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted. If you wish to block, delete, or pre-approve the use of cookies, you generally must do so on each computer and browser on which you wish to block, prevent, or pre-approve such cookies.

To facilitate the delivery of relevant content, some cookies we use are for ‘Google Analytics’. Those are used to identify how users engage with our Site and to provide us with interest and demographic information regarding Site visitors. We may also use this information to optimize marketing and refine advertising and/or programming strategies. For a complete privacy policy and instructions to “opt out” of Google Analytics’ data aggregation and usage, please see [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Web Beacons. A web beacon is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be in the form of a "png" image, as well as iframe, script, input link, embed, object, and other tags that are used to track usage. We may use these web beacons on our Site to deliver cookies, to attribute sales to any advertising media or affiliate partners with whom we may have a relationship, to count visits, to compile statistics about usage, to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns, and/or in emails that we may send you in order to tell if you have opened or acted on email that we have sent you.

Pixels. A pixel is a piece of code or an electronic image embedded on the Site (but ordinarily not visible to users) that collects information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page within the Site or clicked on a particular advertisement, to deliver branded services, and/or to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.

Server Log Data. When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This data may include information such as your IP Address, browser type, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information for which you may search on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and for general technical administration of the Site, to improve the Site’s functionality and convenience, and to better serve our customers’ needs and preferences. We also may use Server Log Data to verify that Site visitors meet criteria that we have established as necessary before processing their purchases.

We may use advertisers, third party ad networks, and other advertising companies to serve advertisements on the Site. Please be advised that such parties may gather information about your visit to the Site or other sites (such as through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such ads were delivered. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices please visit [optout.networkadvertising.org/](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/) and [www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH ADVERTISING COMPANIES.

As noted above, you may block, delete, or pre-approve use of cookies on your computer by adjusting your web browser settings. Such limitations, however, are not effective on mobile applications, though many applications allow users to “opt out” of certain advertisements and other features by adjusting their mobile device settings. If you are using an iOS device, you may opt out of tracking for advertising purposes by clicking on Settings → Privacy → Advertising → Limit Ad Tracking. If you are using an Android device, you may opt out of tracking for advertising purposes by going to Settings → Google Settings → Ads → Enable “Opt out of Ads Personalization.”
