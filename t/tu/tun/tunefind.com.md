# Privacy Policy - TuneFind

We will not, unless legally required to do so, ever share any personally identifiable information collected on this website with anyone outside of TuneFind. We do not currently collect any personally identifiable information.

We collect information in server log files which allow us to determine the number of unique visitors, which pages are most popular, and other statistics regarding traffic on the web site. This allows us to determine where our visitors are coming from, which shows, movies, and songs are most popular, and how we can improve the site to best serve our customers. None of this information is personally identifiable.

When you submit a song appearance, we do not collect any personally identifiable information. We display your submission on this website as well as collect information about the submission in order to reduce the chance of bogus data.

Our site helps you find websites where you can purchase music or derivative products. Those websites have their own privacy policies.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In order to do this, our advertising partners may place a cookie (a small text file) on your computer.

You may customize your ad choices via Ad settings (click the icon next to the ad) or consumer opt out services, like the one provided by [NAI](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).
