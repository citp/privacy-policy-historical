Because your privacy is important to us, Tundra will not sell, rent or trade your personal information collected on this site except as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

Tundra will not disclose your personal information without your express consent unless required to do so by law or unless Tundra has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on Tundra or this web site; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Tundra and this web site; or (3) enforce its agreements with you. Tundra’s agreement not to disclose is subject to the following exceptions:

**Collection and Use of Data**

Tundra uses a commercial software package to analyze traffic to this web site. This information is used in aggregate to analyze and improve this web site.

We also may ask you for information that personally identifies you, such as your name, phone number, e-mail address, credit card number, and mailing address. Such personal information is collected only as part of an explicit registration process, such as that used in connection with purchasing or registering products, requesting additional information, participating in contests or surveys, receiving trial downloads, or registering for one of our training courses or events. This information allows us to process and fulfill your order, to register your subscriptions, to inform you of new products, services or offers, and to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information. We also use some personally identifiable information in conjunction with cookies and web behavioral data in order to help us better understand individual customer needs and behavior, as well as to tailor web site content and marketing messages to your interests.

**Disclosure of Data**

You agree that we may provide your information to our affiliates, resellers and business partners so that they may contact you for promotional purposes relating to Tundra products. As well, we may provide your information to third party service providers, such as fulfillment centers, mailing houses, event providers and customer support organizations. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. Your information also may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Tundra and/or its subsidiaries. While Tundra takes steps to protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of personal information communicated to these third parties, their activities are not subject to the exclusive control of Tundra and they are not subject to this privacy statement. As such, Tundra does not assume any liability for any damages or loss caused by these third parties’ activities.
