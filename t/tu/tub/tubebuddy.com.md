**What information do we collect?**   
We collect information from you when you place an order, link your YouTube channel or use our tools/features. 

• Placing order  
When placing your order, we may ask for your name, address, email address and credit card information. We do not save your credit card number or address.  
All our payment processing is handled by BrainTree/Paypal. You can find information regarding their Privacy Policy here - [BrainTree/Paypal Privacy Policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full)

• Linking your YouTube channel  
When linking your YouTube channel to your TubeBuddy account, we keep meta data and authorization data connected to your YouTube channel. We use this data to allow us to use the YouTube API (see below) to access your account when you authorize us to perform actions on your channel.

• Using TubeBuddy tools/features  
The primary purpose of TubeBuddy is to reduce the effort it takes you to manage your YouTube channel. In order for us to achieve this objective, we maintain certain Channel and TubeBuddy account data to perform the tasks you ask us to perform. We never perform any task unless you instruct us to do so.

**What do we use your information for?**   
Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways: 

• To process updates requested by you  
(based on your request, we will update your channel or video information per your instructions)

• To personalize your experience  
(your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)

• To improve our website  
(we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)

(your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)

• To process transactions  
Your information, whether public or private, will not be processed, sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.

The email address you provide for order processing, will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order. If you decide to opt-in to our mailing list, you will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc.

**How do we protect your information?**   
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or access your personal information. When linking your channel to TubeBuddy, the link is made via Google's secure OAuth 2.0 Protocol. Using this method of access results in us not needing to know or keep your user id or password. 

We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.

**We use YouTube API Services as part of our processing.**   
YouTube provides an API (Application Programming Interface) that TubeBuddy uses to access your channel information. Information about the YouTube API services and Google's privacy policy can be found below.
