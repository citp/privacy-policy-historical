# Adobe Experience Cloud privacy

Last updated: May 3, 2018

The [Adobe Experience Cloud solutions](https://www.adobe.com/experience-cloud.html) _ _ enable our business customers to personalize and improve the performance of their websites, apps, and social media pages. These companies use Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to collect and analyze information, such as clicks made by visitors on their websites, apps, and social media pages. The solutions also allow the companies to provide you with more relevant messages within their emails, text messages, and other online and offline marketing campaigns. In general, companies use Adobe Experience Cloud solutions when they want to better understand and improve their online resources and marketing.

##### What types of solutions are part of the Adobe Experience Cloud?

The Adobe Experience Cloud solutions fall into four general categories:

_Measurement solutions_ , which help companies measure and understand how you use their websites, apps, social media pages, as well as how you interact with their online marketing campaigns.

_Personalization solutions_ , which help companies test new content and make their websites, apps, social media pages, and emails more relevant to you.

_Content management solutions_ , which help companies store, update, and deliver images and other content on their websites, within their apps, and in online marketing materials.

_Advertising solutions_ , which help companies improve their online advertising on websites, apps, search engines, and social media. These solutions also help companies send emails, text messages, and other online and offline marketing campaigns.

In each of these four categories, companies may utilize machine learning technologies available in the solutions to automate the processing of certain data elements in their use of the solutions.

##### What information is collected when a company uses Adobe Experience Cloud?

When a company uses Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, that company chooses how to use the solutions, including what information to collect and send to its Adobe Experience Cloud account. Examples of the types of information that may be collected include the following, depending on the particular Adobe Experience Cloud solution and the jurisdiction of the company:

  * Where you go and what you do on that company's websites, apps, or social media pages
  * Your web browsing activity, including the URLs of the company’s web pages you visit
  * The URL of the page that displayed the link that you clicked on, which brought you to that company's website
  * The web search you performed that led you to that company's website
  * Information about your web browser and device, such as device type, browser type, advertising identifier, operating system, connection speed, and display settings
  * Your IP address (or partial IP address, depending on how the company has configured the solution), which may be used to approximate your general location
  * Location information from your mobile device or web browser
  * Social media profile information
  * Information you may provide on that company's website, app, or when interacting with that company’s social media pages, such as information you provide on registration forms
  * Ad campaign success rates, such as whether you clicked on a company's ad and whether viewing or clicking on the ad led to your purchase of that company's product
  * Items you've purchased or placed in your shopping cart on that company's website or app  




##### How do companies use Adobe Experience Cloud to collect information?

_Cookies and Similar Technologies_. Adobe Experience Cloud solutions use [cookies and similar technologies](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/cookies.html), such as web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to enable companies to collect information in connection with their websites. If you look at your cookie settings in your browser, you may notice cookies from Adobe-owned domains, such as omtrdc.net and demdex.net. Most Internet browsers classify these as "third-party cookies” because they are not set by the website you are visiting. Companies using the Adobe Experience Cloud sometimes choose to use their own cookies (often called "first-party cookies”).

_Mobile_. A company may also use Adobe Experience Cloud technologies within its mobile apps. These technologies allow the company to send information to its Adobe Experience Cloud account -- for example, how you use the company’s mobile apps as well as other information your mobile device may make available to apps, such as location information. For more information, please review the privacy policy of the company as well as privacy information provided by your mobile device manufacturer.

_Social Media_. When you use a company’s social media pages, the social media site you visit (on which the page is located) may allow the company to send certain information about you to its Adobe Experience Cloud account. Most social media sites allow you to configure your settings regarding how your information is used. For more information, please refer to the privacy policies of the social media sites you use.

_Adobe Experience Platform Launch_. Adobe Experience Platform Launch and its predecessor, Adobe Dynamic Tag Management, do not collect data about tag firing as part of these tag management product offering. The Tag Manager itself does not have usage tracking about the on-page firing. With no tags deployed, Adobe Launch and DTM will set no cookies nor make any network calls. When used by a business customer of Adobe’s services, Adobe Experience Platform Launch and DTM will deliver the library containing the customer specified tags for other Adobe Experience Cloud Solutions to either (i) a customer’s own hosting provider (the recommended path) or (ii) to a 3rd party Content Delivery Network (CDN). In either scenario, the hosted server(s) to which the tags are delivered are not owned or managed by Adobe nor does Adobe own the server logs for requests made to those servers.  


##### How do companies use of health-related segments in the Adobe Advertising Cloud?

As part of the Adobe Advertising Cloud solution, Adobe makes available certain health-related segments supplied by third-party data providers to the companies using the Adobe Advertising Cloud. Companies may choose to use these segments to target ads when they are using our solution, to the extent that use is permitted under applicable law and industry guidelines. These data segments generally fall into the following categories: (1) occupation in a health related field, (2) health related topics and conditions (but not specific conditions), (3) interest in health insurance, (4) diet, fitness, weight-loss and healthy lifestyles, (5) consumer goods and services for personal healthcare, vision care, grooming and beauty, (6) over the counter medicines, remedies and dietary supplements, and (7) health related charities.

##### What privacy choices do you have about a company's use of Adobe's Experience Cloud solutions?

_Cookies and Similar Technologies_. Adobe's Experience Cloud uses [cookies and similar technologies](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/cookies.html) to enable companies to collect information. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to block all cookies, or to block only those set by companies other than the one whose website you are visiting. If you configure your browser to block cookies, you may prevent a company from collecting information using Adobe Experience Cloud solutions on its websites. Please see [Your Privacy Choices](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html) to learn more about your choices for opting out of companies’ use of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions.

_Mobile_. Most mobile devices allow you to the limit use of mobile advertising identifiers for interest-based advertising. For more information, please review the instructions provided by your mobile device manufacturer. The Digital Advertising Alliance’s [AppChoices app](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices) may also provide you with more options to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising within mobile apps. Please see [Your Privacy Choices](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html) to learn more about your choices for opting out of companies’ use of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions.

_Email and Text Messages_.

To opt out from receiving mobile push notifications, please review the information provided by your mobile device manufacturer.

_Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op_. The Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op is a data co-operative that enables participating Adobe Experience Cloud companies to better recognize their consumers across devices. Each participating company provides the Co-op with technical information, such as cryptographically hashed login IDs and HTTP header information, about its consumers. But no personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or phone number is shared with the Co-op.  The Co-op then combines and processes the technical information to recognize when multiple devices are used by the same individual (who is not personally identifiable by the Co-op), and creates links among those devices. These device links are used by participating companies to link devices they have already seen visit their sites or advertising, and to provide consistent experiences and marketing activities across the devices. You can learn more about [how the Co-op works or opt-out](https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com/?d_mid=50793010695872993671177561341639296132&d_orgid=9E1005A551ED61CA0A490D45%40AdobeOrg).

_Interest-Based Advertising_. Adobe is a member of the following interest-based advertising self-regulatory groups:

  * [Australian Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.com.au/) (ADAA)
  * [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) (DAA)
  * [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.edaa.eu/) (EDAA)
  * [Network Advertising Initiative](https://www.networkadvertising.org/) (NAI)



Adobe complies with the member requirements of these groups, including the NAI Code of Conduct and other applicable NAI guidance. Please visit these groups' sites for more information about interest-based advertising, including how to opt out of companies' use of Adobe Experience Cloud advertising solutions.

If you opt out, you will no longer receive interest-based ads using Adobe Experience Cloud advertising solutions that are based on your previous activity on websites. You may still receive ads from companies that use our advertising solutions, but they will no longer be based on your previous web browsing or likely interests. When you opt out, Adobe will place at least one opt out cookie on your browser. If you delete your cookies, change browsers, or change devices, you will need to repeat this opt-out process. Also, please note that this opt-out process will work only if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies.

##### How long is information collected on behalf of companies using Adobe Experience Cloud advertising solutions retained?

As described above, the Adobe Experience Cloud advertising solutions use cookies and similar technologies, and mobile technologies, to help companies collect information about how you use their websites and apps so they can provide you with more relevant ads. These ads are often called “interest-based ads.” Adobe generally retains this information within the Adobe Experience Cloud  services for a maximum of 37 months from the time it was collected. The companies that use the Adobe Experience Cloud advertising services may use Adobe’s technologies to collect data, or, as explained below, add additional information to the information they collect using the Adobe Experience Cloud. In these situations, Adobe retains data in accordance with the company’s instructions. 

##### What information can a company upload to Adobe Experience Cloud?

Some of the Adobe Experience Cloud solutions are designed to enable a company to upload information into its Adobe Experience Cloud account. Therefore, companies sometimes upload information that they have collected from their own websites, apps, social media pages, or from other sources, such as third party data providers.  

##### Does Adobe share any of the information its business customers collect using Adobe Experience Cloud?

Adobe does not share its business customers’ information except as described in the [Adobe Privacy Policy](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html#info-share), in the [Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op](https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com/?d_mid=50793010695872993671177561341639296132&d_orgid=9E1005A551ED61CA0A490D45%40AdobeOrg), or when asked to do so by the business customer. Please review the privacy policy of the company using Adobe Experience Cloud for more information about that company's privacy practices.

Companies often allow Adobe to aggregate their data in a way that does not identify individuals for the purpose of publishing reports, such as the [Adobe Digital Index](http://www.cmo.com/adobe-digital-index.html).
