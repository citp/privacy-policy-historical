Last Updated: June 5th, 2018

Tubi, Inc. ("Tubi TV," "Tubi," "we," or "us") provides an online video streaming service offering a selection of television shows, movies, clips, and other content. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference in to the Tubi TV Term of Use (the “Terms”) and explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through the Tubi Services.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through the Tubi Services. If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please let us know by emailing us at [privacy@tubi.tv](mailto:privacy@tubi.tv) or contacting us by mail at the address listed below. Unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms.

### What kinds of information does Tubi collect from or about me and my activities?

If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, age, gender, and date of birth (“PII”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Tubi Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.

Generally speaking, we may collect the following information from or about you and your activities when you use the Tubi Services:

  * information you give us, including your name, email address, birth date, and gender;
  * information automatically collected when you use the Tubi Services, such as your location, your IP Host address, your mobile device type and other device identifiers, your operating system, your rough geo-location based on your IP address, your activity on the Tubi Services, Log Data, and information collected via cookies, web beacons, or other technologies;
  * information from other commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases, or our business partners, which may include your interests, purchasing behavior and your activities online, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed; and
  * if you connect your social networking account with your Tubi account, information from your social networking account as described below.



We may also combine any or all of the information we collect from or about you. We may generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how the Tubi Services are used. We may also link information we obtain from different sources, for example, we may link your Log Data with your Account information or with information we obtain about you from third parties.

### How do we use information we collect from or about you?

Customization, Improvement, Enforcement. We use the other information we collect from or about you in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you and to help deliver a first-class user experience. Tubi's use of this information includes the following general purposes: contacting you; customizing the content and advertising you view; fulfilling your requests for products or services; identifying content you share when you use the Tubi Services; improving our services; administration of your participation in a survey, contest or sweepstakes, conducting research; compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes; preventing potentially illegal activities; protecting our rights; other uses in accordance with our Terms of Use; and for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information.

Recommendations and Advertising. We and service providers acting on behalf of us and our business partners may use the information collected from or about you, including your use of the Tubi Services, to provide recommendations and advertisements on the Tubi Services and elsewhere on the web.

Promotional Communications. We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the Tubi Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Tubi Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy. Information about your choices regarding promotional communications you receive from Tubi are described in the "Your Choices" section of this Privacy Policy.

  * provide you with promotional information about Tubi's features, services, and other offerings that may be of interest to you; or

### What technologies are used to understand how people use the Tubi Services?

Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser. Cookies store information about your activities on a website or other platform. For example, cookies can store your session information for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited. They enable us to make your use of the Tubi Services more enjoyable.

  * We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may display targeted advertisements based on your activities and other information collected from or about you, such as your interests and your activities online. Cookies are one way that this kind of information is stored.
  * We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may also use cookies and similar technologies to compile aggregate data about you and to relate your use of the Tubi Services to information obtained from you or from reputable third parties. For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, data about your activities on the Tubi Services, collected using cookies, may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items that we believe will be of interest to you.
  * You can configure your Internet browser to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, unless you accept cookies, you will not have access to certain the Tubi Services.
  * Some advertisements displayed in connection with the Tubi Services may also access or place cookies on your Internet browser or use other technologies provided by third-party Internet advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services. For more information on this topic, please see our discussion of Third Party Advertising on Tubi.



Other local storage. We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Tubi Services, including the video player. Sometimes called "browser cookies," these technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computers and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences, such as your volume/mute settings. However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies. Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, please click here. Please note that disabling these technologies may interfere with the performance and features of the video player.

Web Beacons (also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).

“Log Data” means certain information about how a person uses our Services, including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of the Tubi Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links and ads on the Tubi Services that a User clicked on, progress of a User’s video play, progress of a User’s ad play, interactions as a video player (e.g. play/pause/seek, close captions), amount of time spent watching videos, mobile to TV screencasting behavior and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Tubi Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance the Tubi Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how the Tubi Services are used.

### With whom does Tubi share the information it collects from or about me?

Our Service Providers and Business Partners. We may engage third-party services providers and business partners to work with us to administer and provide the Tubi Services. For example, we may share your information with other people or entities in order to provide goods or services that you have requested or to complete a transaction at your request. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive while using the Tubi Services. Your information, including clickstream data about your use of the the Tubi Services and other online activities, may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf.

We may also share your PII with our marketing service providers to help us better market our products and services to you. For more information about sharing in the context of third-party advertising, please see our discussion of Third-Party Advertising on Tubi.

Advertisers, Advertising Technology Companies, and Advertising-Related Service Providers.Tubi places advertisements both on and off the Tubi Services and also carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites or properties run by these other companies. Advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information from or about you in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements.

Other Third Parties. We may share anonymized or aggregated data we collect from the use of the Tubi Services, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the computer or device from which you access the Tubi Services, market trends and other analysis that we create based on the information we receive from you and other users. We may share information in these forms with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities, including our business partners. For example, we may share aggregate information with advertisers about the volume of use on the Tubi Services, the specific Tubi videos in which users are most interested, and the effectiveness of advertisements viewed on the Tubi Services (including the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement). Also, we and our business partners use independent third parties to help measure viewing of content on Tubi, and these third parties may report statistics about viewing in aggregated or other non-personally identifiable forms.

(“Facebook”) that enable it to collect or receive information about actions users take on: (a) the Tubi Site and elsewhere on the internet through use of Cookies, Web Beacons and other storage technologies; or (b) our App and other mobile applications, in order to provide measurement services, targeted ads and other services.

In Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.

Other Parties With Your Consent. In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share personally identifiable information about you, for example, your name, address, telephone number, or email address, with any party when we have your consent or when you otherwise choose to share such information, including as set forth below in Section titled "Sharing What You Watch". Also, certain functions within the Tubi Services may give you the option to share information about your activities on the Tubi Services, for example, by email, text message, social networking, or other sharing function.
