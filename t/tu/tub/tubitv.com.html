This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference in to the Tubi TV Term of Use (the “Terms”) and explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through the Tubi Services.</p><p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through the Tubi Services. If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please let us know by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@tubi.tv" rel="noopener" target="_self" class="ATag">privacy@tubi.tv</a> or contacting us by mail at the address listed below. Unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms.</p><h3>What kinds of information does Tubi collect from or about me and my activities?</h3><p>If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, age, gender, and date of birth (“PII”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Tubi Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</p><p>Generally speaking, we may collect the following information from or about you and your activities when you use the Tubi Services:</p><ul><li>information you give us, including your name, email address, birth date, and gender;</li><li>information automatically collected when you use the Tubi Services, such as your location, your IP Host address, your mobile device type and other device identifiers, your operating system, your rough geo-location based on your IP address, your activity on the Tubi Services, Log Data, and information collected via cookies, web beacons, or other technologies;</li><li>information from other commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases, or our business partners, which may include your interests, purchasing behavior and your activities online, such as websites visited and advertisements viewed; and</li><li>if you connect your social networking account with your Tubi account, information from your social networking account as described below.</li></ul><p>We may also combine any or all of the information we collect from or about you. We may generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how the Tubi Services are used. We may also link information we obtain from different sources, for example, we may link your Log Data with your Account information or with information we obtain about you from third parties.</p><h3>How do we use information we collect from or about you?</h3><p><span class="_1iMXM">Customization, Improvement, Enforcement.</span> We use the other information we collect from or about you in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you and to help deliver a first-class user experience. Tubi's use of this information includes the following general purposes: contacting you; customizing the content and advertising you view; fulfilling your requests for products or services; identifying content you share when you use the Tubi Services; improving our services; administration of your participation in a survey, contest or sweepstakes, conducting research; compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes; preventing potentially illegal activities; protecting our rights; other uses in accordance with our Terms of Use; and for any other purpose disclosed to you at the time we collect your information.</p><p><span class="_1iMXM">Recommendations and Advertising.</span> We and service providers acting on behalf of us and our business partners may use the information collected from or about you, including your use of the Tubi Services, to provide recommendations and advertisements on the Tubi Services and elsewhere on the web.</p><p><span class="_1iMXM">Promotional Communications.</span> We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the Tubi Services. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Tubi Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms or this Privacy Policy.

Cookies are small bits of information that are stored in separate files within your computer's Internet browser. Cookies store information about your activities on a website or other platform. For example, cookies can store your session information for easy sign-in to a website or other platform you have previously visited. They enable us to make your use of the Tubi Services more enjoyable.</p><ul><li>We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, may display targeted advertisements based on your activities and other information collected from or about you, such as your interests and your activities online.

We, along with advertising technology companies and service providers that provide services to us and our business partners, use other kinds of local storage, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local storage, in connection with the Tubi Services, including the video player. Sometimes called "browser cookies," these technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your computers and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences, such as your volume/mute settings. However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer from ordinary browser cookies. Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, please click here. Please note that disabling these technologies may interfere with the performance and features of the video player.</p><p><span class="_1iMXM">Web Beacons</span> (also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p><p><span class="_1iMXM">“Log Data”</span> means certain information about how a person uses our Services, including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of the Tubi Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links and ads on the Tubi Services that a User clicked on, progress of a User’s video play, progress of a User’s ad play, interactions as a video player (e.g. play/pause/seek, close captions), amount of time spent watching videos, mobile to TV screencasting behavior and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Tubi Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance the Tubi Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences.
