# Tuts+ Privacy Policy

## 1\. Our policy

  1. Hi, we're Envato. Welcome to the Tuts+ privacy policy for Envato's network of educational online and mobile sites. Your privacy is very important to us so we want to make it clear how we manage it.
  2. When we talk about our **sites** we're referring to our Tuts+ network of sites (including any apps). When we mention **Envato** it's because that's who we are and because we own and run the sites. If we say **policy** we're talking about this privacy policy. If we say **terms** we're talking about the rules for using each site. These are set out in the relevant terms and conditions on each site. Phew! Now that's out of the way, let's get on with the privacy information!
  3. This policy explains how we use any information about you that you provide to us (which might identify you), or that we collect from you when you use the sites (which is unlikely to identify you). So please take the time to read it because it forms part of the terms for each site and you accept it when you use our sites.

    * [hub.tutsplus.com](http://hub.tutsplus.com/),
