Tutor.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy concerns of our users. We only ask you to provide information that we need in order to deliver the service you have requested. We do not share the information you give us without your explicit permission to do so. Your information is completely secure within our internal systems. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: Tutor.com.

This site contains links to other sites. Tutor.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. From time to time, tutors will have the opportunity to participate in special programs and will be able to opt in to programs that will require the transfer of their information to other parties. This will occur only with prior permission from the tutor.   


Services that Require Registration  
Some of our most useful services are personalized; different visitors get different results based on information they provide. For example, if a student creates an account and signs in, he/she can see recently selected tutors, recently selected subjects and a debit account balance. All or part of tutoring sessions are recorded for quality control purposes. Tutor.com reserves the right to review the tutoring sessions for all purposes on behalf of the learners and tutors, respectively. Tutors must create an account to become a Tutor.com tutor. Registration for these services is required to facilitate customization of your individual results. 

Please note, if you do not logout once registered for services that require registration, other users may view some of your personal information if they have access to your computer.

We need to collect this personal information from you for specific reasons. Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and address), unique identifiers (like their email address), and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Opt-In/Out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Your email address is necessary as a unique identifier when you create an account and is used to send you confirmation that you are registered. You need to choose a secret password so that you can keep the personal information that you enter on Tutor.com private. If you are a tutor, we request more extensive information, such as address and educational history, for use in creating your profile. All information you provide, including your email address is uniquely identifying and is not shared with anyone outside Tutor.com, unless you first give us your permission.

Please note, it you choose to participate in our online discussion boards, your posts will be publicly accessible, as will the username and email address you use. We encourage you to exercise caution when deciding to disclose this personal information.

Tutor.com supplements the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties, such as Kroll Background America if you elect to have a background check.  


  
Tutor.com is committed to fully complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. We urge children to check with their parents before entering information on any Web site and we encourage parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.

For Homework Help, we request only an email address to verify a user. Tutor.com does not sell, market, trade, or otherwise share personally identifiable information with any third party. If there is any change in this policy in the future, Tutor.com will notify a child's parent to get his or her consent. Parents have the right to consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties.

Parental Control of Information  
At Tutor.com, our goal is to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe online experience. That's why we've set up a system by which parents can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any identifiable information collected about their child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection of use of their child's information. [You can link to the form here](https://web.archive.org/registration/parental_consent_form.pdf). Tutor.com takes steps to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child and to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian.   


  
Tutor.com offers several opportunities to receive information, such as newsletters. You indicate that wish to receive this information by checking a box on a form. If you do not ask for it, nothing will be sent to you and nothing will be shared with third parties. 

We also give users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communication, such as email, from us and our partners by completing the unsubscribe option from the email. This site gives users the option of having their information removed from our database if the user no longer wants to use our services.
