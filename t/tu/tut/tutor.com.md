# Privacy Policy - Tutor.com

Tutor.com takes your privacy seriously. We know you trust us to help with your homework and we want you to know that you can trust us with your personal information.

### Why We Need Your Personal Information

Tutor.com Direct is personal, and one-to-one. So, we need to collect some personal information from you to set up your account with us. Here are some of the things we need your personal information to be able to do:

  * Make your tutoring sessions personal
  * Store all of your past sessions, so you can review them anytime
  * Complete your purchases
  * Contact you about your account
  * Send you newsletters by mail or email about our service
  * Ask you for your feedback to help make our service better
  * Respond to your email requests for information and/or customer service



You trust us with your Personal Information. So, we do everything we can to make sure your information is safe in our systems. Some things we will NOT do are:

  * We WILL NOT sell your personal information to anyone
  * We WILL NOT send you newsletters or promotional mail or email if you tell us not to



### You and Your Parents Control Your Personal Information

You can visit the Your Account section of this website anytime to see personal information we have collected about you, and you can tell us if you want to receive any promotional mail or email from us.

If you are under age 13, a law called the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) says that we must have a parent's permission before we may collect and use your Personal Information. We will need this permission before we are able to create an account for you or provide you with any tutoring.

Note to parents of children under the age of 13: You are welcome to call us at (800) 411-1970 to review any identifiable information we have collected about your child. If you desire, you may request that we delete this information and/or specify that we collect no more of your child's information. Please note that we will need to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child to ensure that the person is in fact the child's parent or legal guardian, and that a request for us to delete all personal information about a child requires us to cancel the child's tutoring account.

### We Share Your Personal Information With Those Who Pay For Your Account and With Those Vendors Who Help Us Process Transactions

If your parents and/or your school pay for/subsidize any of your tutoring, we may share your Personal Information with them at their request. This may include the content of any (or all) of your tutoring sessions (transcripts) as well as the written comments you leave in post-session surveys. For the purposes of our Privacy Policy, your school is considered to be subsidizing your tutoring if it has negotiated a special price or trial offer for its students. On the other hand, if you pay us for your own account, without the involvement of your parents or your school, we will not share your Personal Information with them.

If you use a promotion code at Tutor.com to create an account, or to add minutes to an account, we may let the source of that promotion code know that you used that code. For example, if you sign up for Tutor.com as part of our tell a friend program, we may let your friend know that you redeemed their tell a friend offer.

We share your personal information with the vendors (companies) that help us process transactions, such as charging your credit card when you make purchases. Any such sharing is always done subject to a legal agreement that requires them to keep your personal information strictly confidential.

### We May Share Your Personal Information For Safety or Legal Reasons

If we have reason to believe that disclosing your Personal Identification is required by law, is reasonable to protect someone from possible injury, or as part of a internal or external legal investigation, we may do so.
