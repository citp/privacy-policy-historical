WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND USE We consider the following to be examples of Personally Identifiable Information but there may be others: your first and last name, email address, home address, phone number, date of birth, credit card information, and certain other information, such as a Social Security Number, if it is linked with your Personally Identifiable Information.

Pearson does not collect Personally Identifiable Information about a user, unless it is voluntarily provided to our Company and so that we can serve the user's needs and our legitimate business purposes as stated in this privacy policy. For example, when the user sends us a message or makes an online purchase, we need to retain certain Personally Identifiable Information on this Site in order to respond or process a purchase. A user's Personally Identifiable Information may also be used by our company to help us improve this Site, and for our company's marketing and promotional purposes. The information will be treated confidentially within our company, as we protect other confidential information. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features or use the Site.  
  PUBLIC POSTINGS Users should be reminded that any Personally Identifiable Information that is voluntarily posted by a user to a public area of a Pearson website (for example, a posting to a bulletin board or chat room) might be collected and used by others. We cannot prevent such uses.

  SPECIAL NOTICE TO PARENTS, TEACHERS AND CHILDREN PARENTS AND TEACHERS: We encourage parents, guardians and teachers to spend time with their Children (Children 12 and under) when their Children engage in the on-line activities on this Site. We will never request Personally Identifiable Information from a Child through Pearson. We do not require anyone to disclose more Personally Identifiable Information, than is reasonably necessary to participate in the on-line activity.  No Personally Identifiable Information of children should be submitted to or posted on this Site by Children without the consent of their parent or guardian. We encourage parents to help us protect their Children's privacy by instructing them never to provide Personally Identifiable Information on this Site or any other website without parental permission.

CHILDREN: Please do not give your full name, email address, home address, telephone number or any other Personally Identifiable Information that would enable someone to contact you either on-line or off-line, without first asking your parent or guardian and teacher for permission.

We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from Children on this Site either directly or passively except when a Child may voluntarily submit such information through a "Contact Us" link on the Site or a public posting area on the Site, if such feature is available. If a Child e-mails us via a "Contact Us" link on any child-directed area of this Site and we can identify the sender as a Child, any Personally Identifiable Information submitted will only be used to respond on a one-time basis to such Child.  In addition, if we have actual knowledge that a Child is sending or posting Personally Identifiable Information on any area of this Site, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such Personally Identifiable Information before it is made public. Please note that any online store that may be accessed from the Site is intended for parents, teachers and other adult purchasers over the age of 18 and requires the submission of Personally Identifiable Information to fulfill and service any transactions.  
We may disclose a Child's Personally Identifiable Information if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose a Child's Personally Identifiable Information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
