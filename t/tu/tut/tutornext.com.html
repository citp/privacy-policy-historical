                            who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
                            tutorNEXT

                            tutorNEXT's practice is to include web beacons in
                            HTML-formatted email messages (messages that include
                            graphics) that tutorNEXT, or its agents, sends in
                            order to determine which email messages were opened
                            and to note whether a message was acted upon.</p>
                          <p>In general, any file served as part of a web page,
                            including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. tutorNEXT
                            may also include web beacons from other companies
                            within pages served by tutorNEXT so that tutorNEXT's
                            advertisers may receive auditing, and reporting.</p>
