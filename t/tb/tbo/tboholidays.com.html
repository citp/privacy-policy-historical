                        We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to
                        complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except
                        to the extent necessary to complete that order. We will use this information to
                        occasionally inform you of promotions being run on the website. Within each email,
                        you will be provided an option to opt out from receiving such emails in the future.
                        We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are
                        not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We use non-identifying
                        and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers.
                        For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain
                        area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify
                        those individuals. Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information
                        provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also
                        providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
