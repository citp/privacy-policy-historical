                        assist us in providing our Site, as more fully described in Section 3.2. We use commercially reasonable
                        efforts to only engage or interact with third party service providers and partners that post a privacy

                        web beacons) to gather information regarding your use of our websites and apps. The use of such
                        information by a third party depends on the privacy policy available on that social network’s website,
                        which we encourage you to carefully review. Such third parties may use these cookies or other tracking
                        methods for their own purposes by relating information about your use of our site with any of your

                        you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from us, we may
                        share Personal Data collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint
                        promotion partner(s). We do not control our business partners’ use of Personal Data we collect, and

                    <p>We may disclose Personal Data about you if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such

                        use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union (the “EU”) member countries and Switzerland.
                        uCool has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of

                    <p>The security of Personal Data is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to
                        protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no
                        method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore,
                        while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its
                        absolute security.</p>
