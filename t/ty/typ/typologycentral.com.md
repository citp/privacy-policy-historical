### **Information Collected from Members**

When you make an account on TypologyCentral, we ask for your email address, which is used to provide you with periodic updates on forum activities and automated notifications, such as email updates for new threads posted in a sub-forum, or an incoming private message. Site moderators and administrators may also contact you via this email address for a variety of reasons including site news, newsletters, forum announcements, automated messages on your status or notifications, or administration of surveys. You are encouraged to keep your identity a secret. To use this forum, you must use an email account that does not allow your "real life" identity to be determined. We also ask for your age, which is used to determine access to age-restricted subforums. You may provide other information as part of your member profile, such as your ZIP code/location, preferences, occupation, and interests, but this is strictly voluntary. 

Members may choose to take personality tests that are linked from the site home page or at other places on the forum. The significant majority of those tests are hosted on other websites that TypologyCentral has no relationship with. We take no responsibility for those tests, those sites or information you enter into them. We do have two tests that are hosted by TypologyCentral - the Free Typology Central Jung Test and the TypologyCentral Social Media Test. Your individual results are placed in a file in a public directory accessible to anyone who visits the site. Results from these tests are also stored in a database and the information in that database may be used for various purposes such as to help people determine their personality type or to facilitate improvements to these and other tests. The information may be analyzed in various ways to support studies on personality type, preferences, testing methods and the like. The results are not tied to your member name, userID or email address though if you post your results on the forum, that connection is established. At no time will this information be used to target individuals for marketing campaigns or other purposes, nor will it be resold for such purposes.

This information is used as input to select the scholarship winners and is used for no other purpose. Information provided by Scholarship applicants is deleted within sixty days of the scholarship winners being announced. Essays are published on the forum and through social media and are not considered personal information.

### **General Suggestions On Protecting Your Information Online**

  * Be careful what personal information you share online, especially on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, forums like this one, and even in email. 
  * Create a separate email account for registering on social networking sites and other online spaces. Don't connect it with your real name or identity.
  * Don't feel obligated to fill out fields that are not required when registering online or provide identifying information.
  * In your online user profile or forum avatar, use a photo that doesn’t identify you or your location, so you can’t be recognized.
  * Choose a username unrelated to your real name, usual nickname, or other identifying information, ideally one that is gender and age neutral. 
  * Websites such as Facebook change their privacy policy all the time, so check your privacy settings periodically to make sure you are sharing only the information you want to share, with only those people you trust and not the general public online. 
  * Do an Internet search of your name periodically to see where you appear online. If you find unauthorized information about yourself, contact the website admin to request its removal.
