# About This Site

### **Introduction**

Protecting member privacy is important at TypologyCentral. Many members value the anonymity of an online forum such as ours, and we do everything possible to protect that. Here, we describe what personal information we do collect and how we use it. We also offer some suggestions to help you to protect your privacy online, here and elsewhere. 

### **Routine Information Collected from All Visitors**

All web servers track basic information about their visitors and our site is no exception. This information includes things like IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify a specific member or visitor. The information is tracked for routine site administration and maintenance purposes, and lets us know which pages and information are useful and helpful to visitors. We also use website analytics tools to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser's width and height. This information is used to assess and improve the effectiveness of our site.

### **Information Collected from Members**

When you make an account on TypologyCentral, we ask for your email address, which is used to provide you with periodic updates on forum activities and automated notifications, such as email updates for new threads posted in a sub-forum, or an incoming private message. Site moderators and administrators may also contact you via this email address. If you wish to keep your identity a secret, it is best to use an email account that is not connected to your "real life" identity. We also ask for your age, which is used to determine access to age-restricted subforums. You may provide other information as part of your member profile, such as your ZIP code/location, preferences, occupation, and interests, but this is strictly voluntary. 

### **Cookies**

TypologyCentral uses only standard Vbulletin cookies. No advertising is allowed on the forum, so you won’t run into any cookies from advertisers. You need not use cookies to use the forum, but doing so will improve your experience here. We use cookies to enable functions like showing whether a subforum you are viewing has new posts since your last visit, or to log you back in automatically when you return to the site if you have chosen this option when registering. If you are using a public computer, such as in a library, school or internet cafe; or if you have reason not to trust others who share your computer, it is best not to enable automatic login. After registering, you may change your cookie options at any time by editing the settings in your browser. If you have privacy concerns about cookies, you can disable cookies entirely through your browser, or disable or enable cookies on a per-site basis. Consult your browser documentation for instructions on how to block cookies and other tracking mechanisms.

### **Sharing of Your Personal Information**

Vendors provide services to support the operation of this site, including hosting services, programming services and other related technical support services. We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your posts and messages, for the following reasons: (a) to comply with the law; (b) to protect the rights or property of other forum members; or (c) to protect the personal safety of our members or the public. 

### What You Post or Share 

Members on the forum can preserve significant anonymity while interacting here. On the other hand, many members choose to become Facebook friends, exchange personal emails, or even meet in person at meet-ups, foregoing that privacy to an extent. Some have gone on to develop strong friendships, start dating relationships, or even get married. Ultimately it is up to you to decide how much personal information to disclose, and to protect information you wish to remain private. Many areas of the forum are accessible to anyone on the public Internet, so anyone can view what you post. Other areas are restricted to members, or more specifically to members over a certain age or post count. Keep this in mind as you choose what to post and where. Information that you post in publicly accessible forums may be reposted or accessed via links that are shared on sites outside of TypologyCentral, such as blogs, Twitter and other websites. If you wish to protect your identity, it is recommended that you be cautious about whom you connect with on social networking sites such as Facebook. Do not externally share or reblog information posted in private members only sections of the forum as information in those areas is intended for members only. Finally, you should never share private information about others.

### **General Suggestions On Protecting Your Privacy Online**

  * Be careful what personal information you share online, especially on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, forums like this one, and even in email. 
  * Create a separate email account for registering on social networking sites and other online spaces. Don't connect it with your real name or identity.
  * Don't feel obligated to fill out fields that are not required when registering online or provide identifying information.
  * In your online user profile or forum avatar, use a photo that doesn’t identify you or your location, so you can’t be recognized.
  * Choose a username unrelated to your real name, usual nickname, or other identifying information, ideally one that is gender and age neutral. 
  * Websites such as Facebook change their privacy policy all the time, so check your privacy settings periodically to make sure you are sharing only the information you want to share, with only those people you trust and not the general public online. 
  * Do an Internet search of your name periodically to see where you appear online. If you find unauthorized information about yourself, contact the website admin to request its removal.
