**International Transfer; Privacy Shield.** The Website is designed for and targeted to U.S. audiences and is governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. 

H&Co complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States. For the Personal Information (and IP addresses), received from residents of the EU and Switzerland, H&Co has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement. If there is any conflict between the standards of this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles govern. 

Under the Onward Transfer Principle, we may remain liable for the processing of Personal Information (and IP addresses) that we transfer to our third party service providers, if any. In some instances, we may also be required to disclose Personal Information (and IP addresses) to comply with valid requests from public authorities, including for the purposes of law enforcement. 

The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over H&Co’s compliance with the Privacy Shield. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>. 

H&Co makes no other representation that the Website is operated in accordance with the laws or regulations of, or governed by, other nations. If you reside outside of the U.S., please be aware that by providing us with personal information, you understand and agree that: (1) your personal information may be transferred to and stored on servers located in the United States; (2) you consent to the transfer of such data to the United States for processing by our affiliates in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and (3) the Privacy Policy and the collection of information pursuant to the Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, H&Co commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.  European Union and/or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact H&Co at:

H&Co has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS ([https://www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/)), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please contact or visit JAMS for more information or to file a complaint. 

These recourse mechanisms are available at no cost to you. Damages may be awarded in accordance with applicable law. Under certain conditions, if you are not satisfied with the above recourse mechanism, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration.

While H&Co encourages all EU and/or Swiss residents who have a complaint to contact us directly so we may address any issues, you also have the right to register a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in the EU Member State where you reside or work. 

**Security, Storage, Retention.** H&Co complies with industry standard practices to maintain the security of information. All financial transactions on the website are conducted via secured transmissions. All stored passwords are hashed in accordance with industry standards. However, as with most Internet sites or services, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully access such personal information despite our efforts. Information collected will not be stored longer than is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or to otherwise meet legal requirements. H&Co may retain personal information pertaining to you as necessary to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with applicable law, resolve disputes and enforce agreements. The log data generated by the cloud.typography service which resides on H&Co servers, contains no IP address or other personal information of visitors to your website, and is deleted within thirty days of processing.

**Your Rights; Reviewing Your Information.** You have the right to access, update, and correct factual inaccuracies in personally identifiable information collected by H&Co, subject to certain exceptions, and to request that your personal information be deleted. Also, under the law of certain countries, you may have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Information (unless we are obligated to process that information to fulfill our obligations under a contract, or to comply with applicable law). If you wish to access, amend, or confirm that H&Co has personal data relating to you, or if you wish to correct or delete your Personal Information, or object to specific processing of your Personal Information, you should log in to your account or you may contact us at:

To help protect your privacy and the security of your personally identifiable information, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time.

While H&Co encourages all users who have a complaint to contact us directly so we may address any issues, you also have the right to register a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in the territory where you reside or work. 

**Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.** H&Co has no intention of collecting any personally identifiable information from individuals under 13 years of age. If a child under 13 has provided personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email address, physical address, birth date, social security number), a parent or guardian of that child should contact us. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from our existing files.

**Links.** This Website may contain links to other websites. H&Co, however, does not control the privacy policies of those sites. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected and maintained solely by H&Co.

**California Privacy Rights and Do Not Track Notice.** California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us via the information below. At this time, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” signals of web browsers. If technological standards for recognition of Do Not Track signals are implemented at any point in the future, we will revisit this issue at that time.
