Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy Updated: July 2018

Typing.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This privacy policy applies to information, including personal information, that Typing.com (a product of Teaching.com) collects about you when you visit our website. This policy does not apply to other Teaching.com websites or apps.

Typing.com offers both a free (Student and Teacher), ad-supported version and a premium (Student and Teacher), subscription-based version. The personal information that we collect, use, share, and disclose is dependent upon the version utilized.

While most of Typing.com is a general audience website through which we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13, the School Edition portion of our site contains features for teachers (such as grading and reporting on performance) designed for students who may be Children. Students under the age of 13 may access the School Edition portion of the site only after their teacher or school representative has entered into an agreement with Typing.com.
