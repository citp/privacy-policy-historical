# Privacy Policy | typeF.com

Effective Date: March 15, 2011

typeF is committed to protecting your privacy and providing a safe online experience for all our users. This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes how we collect, use, and share your information when you use the typeF.com website (the "Site"). If you are not comfortable with this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, please do not provide us with any personally identifiable information.

Information You Provide To Us. We use Facebook Login so you can use your existing Facebook account to access the features of the Site. You must explicitly authorize Facebook to share your information with us when you first login to the Site with your Facebook credentials. You should review your privacy settings on your Facebook account because those settings govern what personal information may be made available to us when you access the Site. We may also collect any information you post on any public areas of the Site or that you may give us in any other way (such as through an email or in connection with a promotion, sweepstakes, or contest). We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from any children under 13. Personally identifiable information is information that permits the identification of an individual such as a first and last name or an email address. 

Other Information We Collect From You. In addition to the information you provide to us by establishing an account or by posting content on the Site, we also collect information through the use of cookies and pixel tags. This information helps us personalize content and advertisements for users to enhance their experience on the Site.

Cookies. When you visit the Site, we may send one or more "cookies" - small data files - to your computer to uniquely identify your browser to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you. These persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser's directions. Our cookies do not collect personally identifiable information that you provide during the account registration process, but they do collect other information such as the following:

  * Your computer's IP address and information about its operating system or platform (Mac, Windows XP, etc.), browser type, and browser language setting;
  * URL of the last webpage you visited before arriving at the Site;
  * The date and time you access the Site and pages you visit; 
  * Demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you; and 
  * All of your activity on the Site (your clicks, pages viewed, comments, search results selected, etc.).



Pixel Tags. Also known as a web beacon or clear GIF, a pixel tag is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email). We may use pixel tags to measure the popularity of various pages and to track which HTML-based emails are opened by recipients. Our pixel tags do not collect any personally identifiable information that you provide to us during the account registration process. 

Information Collected by Third Parties. The Site includes third-party advertising, links to other websites, and other content from third party businesses. We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other businesses, although on occasion we may mutually share non-personally identifiable (e.g., demographic) information to facilitate delivery of relevant advertisements. These third-party advertisers, or advertising networks or agencies working on their behalf, use cookies and pixel tags to, for example, personalize or optimize advertising content and to measure the effectiveness of their ads. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies that these third parties may use, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Policy but are covered by their respective privacy policies. Some, but not all, advertisers provide an opt-out mechanism for interest-based advertising.

If you would like to opt-out of third party "interest-based" advertising, or to learn more about such practices, please visit the following sites:

Use of Information We Collect. We reserve our rights to use your personally identifiable information to respond to your requests, personalize content and advertisements, administer the Site, communicate with registered users, enforce our rights and the rights of third parties, and investigate and ensure compliance with the Terms of Use and applicable law. We also use non-personally identifiable information (such as demographic information, anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, etc.) to better understand Site usage and to make the Site more useful to users.

We may also share your personally identifiable information in the following instances:

  * Third Party Services. We use outside vendors and services to help us better understand our user demographics and how users interact with the Site, and to provide services to us or to you on our behalf. These third parties may have access to your personally identifiable information for use solely in connection with these authorized business activities. 
  * Business Transfer. We may transfer your personally identifiable information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets). 
  * Affiliates. We may share personally identifiable information with our corporate affiliates (see www.demandmedia.com for our major affiliates). Any use of your information by our corporate affiliates is subject to this Policy or another policy no less protective of your privacy. Conversely, we may obtain information about you from our corporate affiliates.
  * Compliance and Safety. We may disclose personally identifiable information when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, our users, or others. 



Retention of Information. We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of information. You must keep your own, separate back-up records.

  * Our Security Measures. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personally identifiable information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty. 
  * Your Obligations. You must protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Please sign off when finished using a shared computer. We will not ask for passwords in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent. YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. 



Updates. We reserve the right to change our Policy at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect immediately. If we make material changes, we will notify you through notice on the home page of the Site or through the email address we have on file for you. The material changes will take effect 30 days after such notice. We encourage you to refer to this Policy at least every 30 days to check for material changes to this Policy.

Identity Theft. If you believe that you are a victim of identity theft entitled by law to request information from us, contact us at our Legal Notice address below and we will let you know what additional information you must provide to us. After we have received that information, we will supply without charge the information legally required to be disclosed that we then have, subject to applicable law and reserving all of our rights and defenses.

Notice Required by Law. In those jurisdictions that permit email notice, if we are required to disclose or provide notice of invasion of certain security systems, we will do so by email to the most current email address provided by you to us.

To send us a legal notice, mail it by certified mail (return receipt requested) to: Demand Media, Legal Department, 5808 Lake Washington Blvd, Suite 300, Kirkland, WA 98033.
