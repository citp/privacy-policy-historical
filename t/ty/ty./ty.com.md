# Privacy Policy

####  WELCOME TO THE TY PRIVACY POLICY AND PARENT'S RESOURCE:

####  Ty Inc. strives to maintain an educational playground for kids and adults all over the world! We have put this section together to provide information for our visitor's about privacy concerns, particularly concerns from a parent's prospective. With the attention being given to on-line safety, we would like to take advantage of this opportunity to address the following issues: 

#### As with any site on the World Wide Web, any individual can observe the events taking place on the Web; however, in order to participate in the interactive portions of our Web site, Ty Inc. requires users to register. Our registration form requests users to include their name, e-mail address, date of birth, state of residence and zip code. This information is never shared with anyone outside of Ty Inc. (and our Web site hosting agents), and it is not used for advertising, promotion or marketing purposes. We do not request a home address or telephone number. The interactive portions of our Web site have a number of features that allow users to post information and write content to our site. Children cannot participate at these interactive forums before Ty first obtains a parent's consent. As a protective measure, we request all individuals to provide some minimal information about themselves. In the event questionable material is posted on our site, we have the necessary information to track down the source of the messages and, if necessary, block that user from posting entries in the future. Additionally, we require our visitors to establish a "USER ID" which is a password protected screen name. This is your identity on the site, and completely eliminates the disclosure of full names or e-mail addresses on our Web site. When references are made to children on our Web site, we include first names only. 

#### Ty utilizes a "cookie" application for the limited purposes of recognizing registered visitors, and communicating a personalized welcome message and data displays based on personal preferences (a "cookie" application automatically collects information from a visitor to a Web site and transfers such information to the visitor's hard drive).

####  In addition, certain non-personally-identifiable information is recorded by the standard operation of Ty's Internet servers. This information allows us to keep our Web site running efficiently. The information that we record includes the browser (such as Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.) and the operating system (such as Macintosh, Windows 95, etc.) being used by the visitor. Another use of this type of information includes the number of visits to the various pages in our site. E-mail addresses and other personally-identifiable data about visits to this site are known only when voluntarily submitted. 

#### Personally-identifiable information, including names and identities, collected through our Web site is kept by Ty (and our Web site hosting agents) and is not released, sold, or in any way transferred outside the company. Ty firmly believes in safety and privacy on the Internet and does not collect information about or disclose the identity of children on the Internet without prior parental approval, nor does it disclose the identity of adults without prior approval. 

#### Ty is particularly dedicated to providing children with a safe and fun Internet environment. Ty has developed privacy policies that are focused on protecting children, and it is Ty's intention to adhere to the Children's Advertising Review Unit ("CARU") Guidelines for Advertising on the Internet and Online Services, as well as the Federal Trade Commission's ("FTC") Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule. Before children age 17 or younger can interact with others at our site, we require that they obtain parental consent. Furthermore, we have developed a symbol () that will allow parents and children to easily distinguish material that is of an advertising or promotional nature. 

#### If your child is age 17 or younger, we must obtain your parental consent before your child can participate in the Ty Talk Cyberboard and TyFolio. All segments of this Web site that allow users to post information have language filters that are designed to electronically monitor all entries for objectionable content. Any objectionable entries which are not removed by our electronic filters are removed through our regular monitoring. If you happen to see a posting anywhere on our Web site that you feel is objectionable, please utilize the [Emergency Email Form](https://web.archive.org/privacy/input.html) which will direct your message to an individual at Ty who will look into the matter as soon as possible. 

#### Ty believes that parents should actively supervise and participate in their children's on-line activities. If you no longer want your child to participate in the Ty Talk Cyberboard or TyFolio, or if you would like to correct any information that your child has submitted to us, please notify us at contact@Ty.com, and we will make your requested changes within 48 hours. Further, Ty recommends the use of parental control software tools that are readily available from on-line services and software manufacturers. Such parental software tools are designed to not only screen out objectionable content, but also to allow parents to prevent their children from disclosing names, addresses, and other personal information without parental permission. 

#### Ty believes in on-line safety and would welcome any suggestions that you may have. Please contact us at:
