      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Tyba we have a few
      fundamental principles:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li>
	<li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply
	with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
	<li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for
	the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
	<li>In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to
	control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept
	private, and permanently deleted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
      <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data
      please contact our support team.</p>
      <p>Tyba Solutions Ltd. (“Tyba”) operates several websites including tyba.com.
      It is Tyba's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
      may collect while operating our websites.</p>
      
      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, Tyba collects non-personally-identifying
      information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
      available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
      and the date and time of each visitor request. Tyba's purpose in collecting
      non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Tyba's
      visitors use its website. From time to time, Tyba may release non-personally-identifying
      information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
      the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>Tyba also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
      comments or messages on Tyba.com websites. Tyba only discloses logged in
      user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
      and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except
      that website commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the
      administrators of the website where the comment was left.</p>
      
      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to Tyba's websites choose to interact with Tyba in
      ways that require Tyba to gather personally-identifying information. The
      amount and type of information that Tyba gathers depends on the nature of
      the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a website at
      Tyba.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in
      transactions with Tyba - by purchasing upgrades or premium features to their
      websites, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including
      as necessary the personal and financial information required to process
      those transactions. In each case, Tyba collects such information only insofar
      as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's
      interaction with Tyba. Tyba does not disclose personally-identifying information
      other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
      personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent
      them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
      
      <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
      <p>Tyba may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
      websites. For instance, Tyba may monitor the most popular websites of the
      Tyba users. Tyba may display this information publicly or provide it to
      others. However, Tyba does not disclose personally-identifying information
      other than as described below.</p>
      
      <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Tyba discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
      information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated
      organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
      it on Tyba's behalf or to provide services available at Tyba's websites,
      and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
      employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside
      of your home country; by using Tyba's websites, you consent to the transfer
      of such information to them. Tyba will not rent or sell potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
      Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
      as described above, Tyba discloses potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
      order or other governmental request, or when Tyba believes in good faith
      that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
      of Tyba, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user
      of a Tyba website and have supplied your email address, Tyba may occasionally
      send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
      or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Tyba and our products.
      If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of
      our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
      help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
      Tyba takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
      unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
      
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
      computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each
      time the visitor returns. Tyba uses cookies to help Tyba identify and track
      visitors, their usage of Tyba websites, and their website access preferences.
      Tyba visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
      should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Tyba's websites,
      with the drawback that certain features of Tyba's websites may not function
      properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
      
      <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
      <p>If Tyba, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the
      unlikely event that Tyba goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user
      information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by
      a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any
      acquirer of Tyba may continue to use your personal information as set forth
      in this policy.</p>
      
      <h2>Ads</h2>
      <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising
      partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize
      your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
      information about you or others who use your computer. This information
      allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements
      that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy
      covers the use of cookies by Tyba and does not cover the use of cookies by
      any advertisers.</p>
      
      <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Tyba may change its Privacy
      Policy from time to time, and in Tyba's sole discretion. Tyba encourages
      visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
      If you have a Tyba.com account, you should also check your website's dashboard
      for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change
      in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
