## How do we protect your personal information?

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical security safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personal information you provide on our website, in our stores and through other means.

Obviously no collection or transmission of information over the internet is 100% secure and although we take every possible measure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such transmission.

You can assist with protection by ensuring that if you create a password to access any section of our website, you make sure it is hard to guess, contains a combination of letters and figures and that you keep it safe by not disclosing it to anyone. If someone logs in as you using your email and password we will not be able to detect that it is not you and cannot be responsible for any action we take in response to someone using your user name and password.

## How can you get access to any information we have about you?

TJX charges £10 for UK requests and will require you to prove your identity before providing any data.

We do use third parties to perform some services on our behalf and in such cases, they may have limited access to certain personal information. In such cases, they may only use personal information strictly as instructed and never for their own purposes. Examples of when personal information you provide to us may be accessed by third parties are:

TK Maxx and HomeSense are owned and operated by TJX UK, a subsidiary of The TJX Companies, Inc established in the USA. We may share the information you provide with companies who form part of our group of companies and, in certain circumstances, with our joint marketing partners. This means that the information you provide us may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to various countries, including the United States. This information may be subject to the laws of the countries in which it is stored or used, and those countries may have a different data protection regime than the country in which you reside. By providing us with any personal information, you consent to such transfer, processing and storage of your personal information. 

In the event that we run a promotion in conjunction with another sponsor, your personal information may be shared with such sponsors, but this will be specified at the time of collection. We do not control the use, disclosure or security of your personal information by other sponsors, so we recommend you carefully review their privacy policy. 

In addition we may disclose information: 

  * If we are required to do so by law or legal process; 
  * To law enforcement agencies; 
  * When we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or suspected or actual illegal activity; or 
  * To selected third parties for the purpose of prevention and detection of criminal activity (including, without limitation, fraud); or 
  * If TK Maxx or HomeSense merges, sells or disposes of any part of its business or assets, which includes customer information.
