## SHARING INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES __

We do not sell, otherwise disclose, or share information we collect and hold about you, except as described in this Privacy Statement.

We share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example, we may use third parties to host our websites or mobile apps, operate certain of its features, send e-mails, print or send mailings, run our sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, conduct customer research, authorize and process your payments, manage and analyze data and our advertising effectiveness, and fulfill orders. These third parties are not authorised by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Any personal information shared with such third parties is protected as described below.

Subject to applicable law, we may also share the personal information we obtain with our affiliates, subsidiaries and other group companies. If we share your personal information with such persons, we will ensure that an adequate level of protection is in place to protect your personal information in accordance with applicable law.

We also may disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena) including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (iii) for the purpose of or in connection with legal proceedings, or otherwise for the purpose of establishing, exercising or defending our legal rights; or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. 

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganisation, dissolution or liquidation), but only where we have first taken reasonable steps to ensure the security and confidentiality of your information. 

## HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION __

We maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access. However, we cannot guaranty the effectiveness of these safeguards, and nothing in this notice shall be construed as an express or implied warranty against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.

Service providers who might have access to your information in order to provide services on our behalf will be contractually obliged to keep such information in confidence, implement adequate data security measures, and may not use that data for any other purpose.

## LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES __

Our websites may contain links to other third party websites for your convenience and information. These websites may operate independently from us. Linked websites may have their own privacy policies or notices, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked website or applications. We are not responsible for the content, use or privacy practices of any website or applications that are not affiliated with us. 

## RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION __

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the information we process is reliable for its intended use, is accurate, up-to-date and complete, and is limited to the information required to carry out processing for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement. We retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collect it, except if required otherwise by law.  

## DATA TRANSFERS __

We may transfer to and store the information we collect about you in countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected, including the United States and other destinations outside the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”), in accordance with applicable law. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you provided the information. When we transfer your information to other countries, we will protect the information as described in this Privacy Statement and comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of information to countries outside the EEA.

Please note that individuals in Poland have the right to object to data transfers to other data controller entities within the TJX group.

Subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights with respect to our processing of your information. You may have the right to request access to the information we hold about you, obtain confirmation as to whether or not information concerning you exists, be informed of the content and source of such information and check its accuracy. In addition, you may have the right to correct, update, delete, block, cancel, or object to the use of, your information held by us.

If you change your mind and no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us, you have the right to request that we cease sending marketing communications, whether by email or otherwise, to you. You can do this by:

  * checking the applicable box(es) on any form we may use to collect information from you;
