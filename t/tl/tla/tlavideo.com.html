<div class="window">
	<p>TLA realizes that making purchases online requires trust. We value our customer's trust and privacy and we pledge to you that we will work to protect the security and privacy of any personal information you provide to us. This includes, and is not limited to, any and all information you submit to us to complete an order, enter a contest or giveaway, or request information from TLA.</p>
	<p>TLA believes it is your right to know what information we may collect from you and how and why we may use it. This document helps to explain these procedures.</p>
	<p>TLA Entertainment Group, Inc. (TLA) is the owner and operator of tlavideo.com. We collect information from our customers that allow us to serve you, our customer, more effectively.</p>
	<p>If you are a registered customer, you can change or modify your personal information at anytime by going to <a class="federated" href="https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&amp;sn=1&amp;g=0&amp;go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&amp;domain=tlavideo.com&amp;fsc=(*CFID*!1952741.0,*sn*!1,*ic*!false)">My User Account</a>.

	<p class="highlight">1. Personal information we collect</p>
	<p>We collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using the TLA website.

We may also ask you for personal information when you contact our customer service department. This is necessary so we can protect against fraud and to process your request more efficiently.</p>

	<p class="highlight">3. When and with whom we share your personal information</p>
	<p>We never sell or rent your billing or credit card information to any third parties under any circumstance. We will share customer information only with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers and contractors for the limited purposes of fulfilling customer orders; offering certain products and services in connection with our Website; communication to customers; providing customer service; enhancing and improving the customer shopping experience; providing a personalized shopping experience and completing credit card transactions.</p>
	<p>We will not share your email address with any third party without your explicit consent.  Occasionally we run promotions on our site, which may include the opportunity to opt-in to email lists for specific partner companies.  In these cases, sharing your email address will not be required and the promotion will include specific information about how your email address will be shared.</p>
	<p>On rare occasions we partner with other major companies whose products or services we feel offer the same high quality and standards as our own. In these instances our postal mailing lists are made available to them. While we carefully pick and choose whom we partner with, we understand perfectly if you prefer to hear from no one but us. To remain exclusively with us and not receive information about any other companies or their services, please call us at 1-800-333-8521, ext. 1 or e-mail <a href="mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com">helpdesk@tlavideo.com</a>.</p>
	<p>Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law. We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
	<p class="highlight">4. How you can decide what marketing communication your receive from us</p>

If you would prefer to receive no email from TLA ever, simply go to <a class="federated" href="https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&amp;sn=1&amp;g=0&amp;go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&amp;domain=tlavideo.com&amp;fsc=(*CFID*!1952741.0,*sn*!1,*ic*!false)">My User Account</a>, log in, click "Email Preferences" and click the box requesting to be removed from all mailing lists. We may also need to contact you about a problem with an order you placed. If you don't want to be contacted via e-mail and would prefer phone contact, please call our customer service department at 800-333-8521 x1.</p>
	<p>The only email you will receive from tlavideo.com if you are not subscribed to our email list will be to confirm any purchases you make on our site, let you know your order has been shipped, respond to any customer service inquiries and to answer any other questions you might have about our site.</p>
	<p class="highlight">5. How we protect the security of your personal information</p>
	<p>The security of your personal information is as important to TLA as it is to you. TLA uses a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLA has obtained a digital certificate from <a href="http://www.thawte.com" target="_blank">Thawte Technologies, Inc.</a>, a division of <a href="http://www.verisign.com" target="_blank">Verisign, Inc.</a> When you enter a secure section of the TLA site, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. The digital certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted to the secure and encrypted TLA Web server.</p>
	<p>Your personal information is protected by the password you created when you registered an account at TLA. It is your responsibility to keep this password confidential. You may change this password at anytime by going to <a class="federated" href="https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&amp;sn=1&amp;g=0&amp;go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&amp;domain=tlavideo.com&amp;fsc=(*CFID*!1952741.0,*sn*!1,*ic*!false)">My User Account</a>. Log in with your email address and password and then click "Account Information" and enter a new password.</p>
	<p class="highlight">6. Changes to the TLA Privacy Policy</p>
