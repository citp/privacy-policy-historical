	<p>TLA believes it is your right to know what information we may collect from you and how and why we may use it. This document helps to explain these procedures.</p>
	<p>TLA Entertainment Group, Inc. (TLA) is the owner and operator of tlavideo.com. We collect information from our customers that allow us to serve you, our customer, more effectively.</p>
	<p>TLA Entertainment Group, Inc. has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy	and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html" ;="" target="_blank">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.

	<p>If you are a registered customer, you can change or modify your personal information at anytime by going to <a class="federated" href="https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&amp;sn=1&amp;g=0&amp;go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&amp;domain=tlavideo.com&amp;fsc=(*CFID*!1.1233693E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!7.4159406E7,*ic*!false)">My User Account</a>.

	<p class="highlight">1. Personal information we collect</p>
	<p>We collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using the TLA website. This information includes your name, email address and a password when you register to create your tlavideo.com account. You are able to browse our site and place an order without registering, but you will need to do so in order to take advantage of special TLA features. We may also ask you for personal information when you contact our customer service department. This is necessary so we can protect against fraud and to process your request more efficiently.</p>
	<p><em>Purchase information</em></p>
	<p>When you place an order with tlavideo.com, we collect your name, email address, phone number, billing and shipping addresses, credit card number, expiration date and identification code if applicable. This information is important in processing your order and verifying your billing address. It also allows us to ship your order and keep you informed regarding the status of your order. Billing information can be provided over the phone by calling our customer service department at 1.800.333.8521x1.</p>
	<p>If you are a registered customer of tlavideo.com, you can save your shipping address or billing information for one or more credit cards in <a class="federated" href="https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&amp;sn=1&amp;g=0&amp;go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&amp;domain=tlavideo.com&amp;fsc=(*CFID*!1.1233693E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!7.4159406E7,*ic*!false)">My User Account</a>.

We treat this information with the same policies as outlined in this document.</p>
	<p>We will use your email address that you provide to respond to your questions, suggestions, to send participants an email newsletter, and/or requests for assistance in using tlavideo.com.</p>
	<p>We do not currently use a third party service provider to conduct these contests or giveaways (though we reserve the right to do so in future); if we do ever use a third party service, that company is will be prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or giveaway with other third parties.</p>

	<p class="highlight">3. When and with whom we share your personal information</p>
	<p>We never sell or rent your billing or credit card information to any third parties under any circumstance.

In these cases, sharing your email address will not be required and the promotion will include specific information about how your email address will be shared.</p>
	<p>On occasion, we partner with other major companies whose products or services we feel offer the same high quality and standards as our own. In these instances our postal mailing lists are made available to them. While we carefully pick and choose whom we partner with, we understand perfectly if you prefer to hear from no one but us. To remain exclusively with us and not receive information about any other companies or their services, please call us at 1-800-333-8521, ext. 1 or e-mail <a href="mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com">helpdesk@tlavideo.com</a>. You can also go to the <a class="federated" href="https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&amp;sn=1&amp;g=0&amp;go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&amp;domain=tlavideo.com&amp;fsc=(*CFID*!1.1233693E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!7.4159406E7,*ic*!false)">My User Account</a> section of our site and under the Mailing List Preferences tab select the option (at the bottom of the page) for "I do not wish to have my information shared with third parties."</p>

	<p>In the event TLA goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
	<p>We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
	<p class="highlight">4. How you can decide what marketing communication your receive from us</p>
	<p>If you choose to receive them, tlavideo.com will periodically send you email messages describing new products, featured merchandise and special promotions and/or giveaways. You can choose to stop receiving these emails at any time. Simply go to <a class="federated" href="https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&amp;sn=1&amp;g=0&amp;go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&amp;domain=tlavideo.com&amp;fsc=(*CFID*!1.1233693E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!7.4159406E7,*ic*!false)">My User Account</a>, log in, click "Mailing List Preferences" and unclick any box currently checked in our email subscriber list. You may also chose to no longer receive these email communications by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the emails you receive.</p>
	<p>If you select not to receive any marketing emails as described above, we may occasionally send a general email to our existing non-subscribed customers encouraging them to opt-in. You may opt out of receiving them as above. We may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information. If you would prefer to receive no email from TLA ever, simply go to <a class="federated" href="https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&amp;sn=1&amp;g=0&amp;go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&amp;domain=tlavideo.com&amp;fsc=(*CFID*!1.1233693E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!7.4159406E7,*ic*!false)">My User Account</a>, log in, click "Mailing List Preferences" and click the box requesting to be removed from all mailing lists.

	<p>The only email you will receive from tlavideo.com if you are not subscribed to our email list will be to confirm any purchases you make on our site, let you know your order has been shipped, respond to any customer service inquiries and to answer any other questions you might have about our site.</p>
	<p class="highlight">5. Accessing your personal information</p>
	<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct or update it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at helpdesk@tlavideo.com.  We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.</p>

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
	<p class="highlight">6. How we protect the security of your personal information</p>
	<p>The security of your personal information is as important to TLA as it is to you. TLA uses a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLA has obtained a digital certificate from <a href="https://www.geotrust.com" target="_blank">GeoTrust, Inc.</a> When you enter a secure section of the TLA site, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. The digital certificate guarantees that your personal information and/or sensitive information (such as a credit card number) is being transmitted to the secure and encrypted TLA Web server. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com">helpdesk@tlavideo.com.</a></p>
	<p>Your personal information is protected by the password you created when you registered an account at TLA. It is your responsibility to keep this password confidential. You may change this password at anytime by going to <a class="federated" href="https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&amp;sn=1&amp;g=0&amp;go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&amp;domain=tlavideo.com&amp;fsc=(*CFID*!1.1233693E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!7.4159406E7,*ic*!false)">My User Account</a>. Log in with your email address and password and then click "Account Information" and enter a new password.</p>
	<p class="highlight">7. Links to other sites</p>
	<p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of TLA. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.</p>
	<p class="highlight">8. Customer reviews</p>
	<p>We post customer reviews on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. These reviews are moderated prior to posting, and if you wish to request the removal of your review you may do so by contacting us at helpdesk@tlavideo.com.</p>
	<p class="highlight">9. Wishlists</p>
	<p>When you add a product to your wish list, those items will NOT be listed in our publicly accessible wishlist directory. You may make all or a portion of your wish list products public at your discretion; go to My User Account, select “Wishlist” and make the appropriate selections.</p>
	<p class="highlight">10. Changes to the TLA Privacy Policy</p>
	<p>We reserve the right to change, modify or amend this privacy policy at any time. If we make any significant change to this policy, we will post a notice of the change on tlavideo.com.</p>
	<p class="highlight">11. How to contact TLA</p>
