We value our customer's trust and privacy and we pledge to you that we will work to protect the security and privacy of any personal information you provide to us. This includes, and is not limited to, any and all information you submit to us to complete an order, enter a contest or giveaway, or request information from TLA.

TLA believes it is your right to know what information we may collect from you and how and why we may use it. This document helps to explain these procedures.

TLA Entertainment Group, Inc. (TLA) is the owner and operator of tlavideo.com. We collect information from our customers that allow us to serve you, our customer, more effectively.

TLA Entertainment Group, Inc. has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with [TRUSTe's program requirements](http://www.truste.com/privacy-program-requirements/) including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, [www.tlavideo.com](http://www.tlavideo.com/).

If you are a registered customer, you can change, modify or delete your personal information at any time by going to [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=tlavideo.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!2.06132737E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!6.1204787E7,*ic*!false\)). Log in with your email address and password, click "Account Information" and edit your personal information as you wish.

##  1\. Personal information we collect 

We collect personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily when using the TLA website. This information includes your name, email address and a password when you register to create your tlavideo.com account. You are able to browse our site and place an order without registering, but you will need to do so in order to take advantage of special TLA features. We may also ask you for personal information when you contact our customer service department. This is necessary so we can protect against fraud and to process your request more efficiently.

### Purchase information

When you place an order with tlavideo.com, we collect your name, email address, phone number, billing and shipping addresses, credit card number, expiration date and identification code if applicable. This information is important in processing your order and verifying your billing address. It also allows us to ship your order and keep you informed regarding the status of your order. Billing information can be provided over the phone by calling our customer service department at 1.800.333.8521x1.

If you are a registered customer of tlavideo.com, you can save your shipping address or billing information for one or more credit cards in [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=tlavideo.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!2.06132737E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!6.1204787E7,*ic*!false\)). You may change or delete this information at any time by clicking on [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=tlavideo.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!2.06132737E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!6.1204787E7,*ic*!false\)). Log in using your email address and password, then you may change or delete any personal information that you like.

### Cookies and other computer information

When you visit the TLA website, you will be assigned a "cookie" (a small unique identifier text file) to be stored on your computer's hard drive. The purpose of this cookie is to identify you when you visit our site so we can enhance and customize your shopping experience.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.

Your browser must be set to accept this "cookie" for you to be able to shop on tlavideo.com. You can delete this "cookie" on your computer once you have completed shopping. To delete a cookie on your browser refer to the "Help" menu on your particular browser.

The use of cookies by our web analytics provider and chat widget provider are not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our web analytics provider and chat widget provider use session ID cookies solely for the purpose providing us with aggregated analysis of the traffic on our site. Neither we nor they can in any way discern personal information from the data they collect or provide to us.

We and our third party tracking-utility partners collect technical information from your computer each time you request a page during your visit to tlavideo.com through log files. This information will include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system and browser type. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you. We collect this information to enhance your experience at tlavideo.com and to help us create and develop an improved site. We do not rent or sell this information to any third parties.

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

### Other times we may collect personal information

From time to time, TLA may conduct contests and/or giveaways using our Website, email, or other media. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. If you choose to participate, we may require you to supply personal information such as email and/or postal mailing information. We treat this information with the same policies as outlined in this document.

We will use your email address that you provide to respond to your questions, suggestions, to send participants an email newsletter, and/or requests for assistance in using tlavideo.com.

We do not currently use a third party service provider to conduct these contests or giveaways (though we reserve the right to do so in future); if we do ever use a third party service, that company will be prohibited from using our users’ personal information for any other purpose. We will not share the personal information you provide through a contest or giveaway with other third parties.

##  2\. Use of your personal information

##  3\. When and with whom we share your personal information 

We never sell or rent your billing or credit card information to any third parties under any circumstance. We will share customer information only with our agents, representatives and trusted service providers and contractors for the limited purposes of fulfilling customer orders such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services and a shipping company to fulfill orders; offering certain products and services in connection with our Website; communication to customers; providing customer service via live chat software; enhancing and improving the customer shopping experience; providing a personalized shopping experience and completing credit card transactions.

We will not share your email address with any third party without your explicit consent. Occasionally we run promotions on our site, which may include the opportunity to opt-in to email lists for specific partner companies. In these cases, sharing your email address will not be required and the promotion will include specific information about how your email address will be shared.

On occasion, we partner with other major companies whose products or services we feel offer the same high quality and standards as our own. In these instances our postal mailing lists are made available to them. While we carefully pick and choose whom we partner with, we understand perfectly if you prefer to hear from no one but us. To remain exclusively with us and not receive information about any other companies or their services, please call us at 1-800-333-8521, ext. 1 or e-mail [helpdesk@tlavideo.com](mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com). You can also go to the [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=tlavideo.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!2.06132737E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!6.1204787E7,*ic*!false\)) section of our site and under the Mailing List Preferences tab select the option (at the bottom of the page) for "I do not wish to have my information shared with third parties."

Aside from the purposes described above, we will never share your personal information with any third parties unless we have your express permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law.

In the event TLA goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

We may share aggregated demographic and statistical information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

##  4\. How you can decide what marketing communication your receive from us 

If you choose to receive them, tlavideo.com will periodically send you email messages describing new products, featured merchandise and special promotions and/or giveaways.

You may also choose to no longer receive these email communications by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the emails you receive.

If you select not to receive any marketing emails as described above, we may occasionally send a general email to our existing non-subscribed customers encouraging them to opt-in. You may opt out of receiving them as above. We may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information. If you would prefer to receive no email from TLA ever, simply go to [Email Preferences](https://web.archive.org/web/20141123014841id_/http%3A//www.tlavideo.com/company/supportOption.cfm?supID=41), enter your email address to view your preferences, and click the box "I do not wish to receive any e-mail". We may also need to contact you about a problem with an order you placed. If you don't want to be contacted via e-mail and would prefer phone contact, please call our customer service department at 800-333-8521 x1.

If you choose to receive product alerts within your user account we will occasionally send you emails based upon your request. If you would like to change the frequency with which you receive alerts or if you no longer wish to receive them simply go to [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=tlavideo.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!2.06132737E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!6.1204787E7,*ic*!false\)), long in, click on “Alerts” and make the appropriate selections.

##  6\. How we protect the security of your personal information 

The security of your personal information is as important to TLA as it is to you. TLA uses a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). TLA has obtained a digital certificate from [GeoTrust, Inc.](https://www.geotrust.com/) When you enter a secure section of the TLA site, an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. The digital certificate guarantees that your personal information and/or sensitive information (such as a credit card number) is being transmitted to the secure and encrypted TLA Web server. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [helpdesk@tlavideo.com.](mailto:helpdesk@tlavideo.com)

Your personal information is protected by the password you created when you registered an account at TLA. It is your responsibility to keep this password confidential. You may change this password at any time by going to [My User Account](https://www.tlasecure.com/customer/userlogin.cfm?v=1&sn=1&g=0&go=%2Fcustomer%2Faccount%5Fmain%2Ecfm%3Fv%3D1%26g%3D0%26sn%3D1&domain=tlavideo.com&fsc=\(*CFID*!2.06132737E8,*sn*!1,*CFTOKEN*!6.1204787E7,*ic*!false\)). Log in with your email address and password and then click "Account Information" and enter a new password.

##  7\. Links to other sites

##  9\. Social Media Widgets

Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site.
