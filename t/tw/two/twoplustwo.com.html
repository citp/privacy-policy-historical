      <h2>WHAT IS  TWO PLUS TWO'S PRACTICE REGARDING COOKIES?</h2>
      <p>Your Internet browser has a feature  called cookies, which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your  visit to our site. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit our site,  although active participation in certain areas of our sites may require  cookies. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you  specifically give us personally identifiable information, in which case we use  the information to enhance your services in the ways described below. By  adjusting your settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to  be collected.</p>
      <p>We also use technologies, including  electronic images known as Web bugs - sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear  GIFs, or beacons - that allow us to track general user-traffic patterns. We  also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from  your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our  site, and information about pages you visited. Unless you have registered for  one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of  tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable  information about you.</p>
      <p>We  use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Keeping count of return visits to       our site or our advertisers' or partners' sites;</li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Tracking referrals; </li>
        <li>Accumulating and reporting       anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on       Web-site and advertisement usage; </li>
        <li>Determining which features our       overall forum user population likes best; </li>
        <li>Saving your password so you don't       have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites; </li>
        <li>Displaying the most appropriate       advertising or content based on your interests.</li>

        <li>To enhance the user experience in       our site. We use tracking information to determine how well each page       performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns       to those pages. This helps us continue to build a better Service for you; </li>
