**Security**  
America’s Best is committed to doing its best to maintain the security of all information collected on our web site. All transactions occur through our secure server, protected by a DigiCert® Secure Site Certificate. That means that we use encryption to secure information sent from your computer to our servers. In addition, credit card numbers and other sensitive information are encrypted in our database(s) to provide a second layer of security for your private information. When credit card information is transmitted online, America’s Best uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server software to prevent unauthorized access to the information. SSL is a highly sophisticated method of scrambling data as it travels from your computer to our web site’s servers. You can identify the secure connection by looking for a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window.

We use commercially reasonable methods to prevent the unauthorized use, access, or disclosure of your personal information. While we strive to protect your personal information, no system can ever be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information. By using our web site, you are agreeing to assume this risk and any and all responsibility and liability that may arise.

**Children’s Policy**  
Our web site and its services are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. It is our policy not to knowingly solicit or permit children under the age of 13 to provide their personal information for any purpose. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, if a person under age 13 submits information to us through any part of our web site, and we know that the person submitting information is under age 13, we will not use it for any purpose.

**Your California Privacy Rights**  
California law permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared such information in the immediately preceding calendar year. At this time, America’s Best does not disclose your personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes, only to assist America’s Best in its own marketing efforts, so this requirement does not apply to us.

In addition, under California law, web site operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party web sites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. America’s Best does not respond to any such “do not track” signals, as no one do not track standard has gained consensus.

This law also requires web site operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over time and across different web sites when the users use the operator’ web site. America’s Best does not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses our web site.

Third parties that have content embedded on our web site (such as social networking features) may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited our web site from a certain IP address. These third parties cannot collect any other personal information from our web site unless you provide it to them directly.

**California Transparency in Supply Chains Act**  
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires that applicable manufacturers and retailers such as National Vision, Inc. (“NVI”) disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from the supply chain.

NVI is committed to conducting business in accordance with ethical, legal and socially responsible rules and principles. These standards and commitments are outlined in the Company’s Code of Conduct (the “Code”) which every NVI Associate is trained on upon hire and is distributed annually during the course of their employment. Consistent with the Code, we respect the personal dignity of every individual and comply with all applicable human rights laws. Failure to comply with the standards of the Code subjects violators, regardless of position, to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

With respect to our supply chain partners, we expect the same commitment to high ethical standards and compliance with applicable laws, as detailed in the Code. NVI monitors the standards of our supply chain partners for quality, safety and employment standards by conducting annual scheduled on-site audits of our major vendors and laboratory manufacturers. When entering into written contracts with suppliers, NVI requires suppliers to comply with all applicable laws which include those that prohibit slavery and human trafficking. Failure to comply with all applicable laws subjects supplier to breach and possible termination of contract.

At this time NVI does not engage independent auditors or require separate verifications/certifications from its suppliers relating to human trafficking and slavery. While NVI believes it conducts its business with suppliers that maintain high ethical standards, we are continuously evaluating additional programs as it relates to combating the tragedy of human trafficking and slavery.
