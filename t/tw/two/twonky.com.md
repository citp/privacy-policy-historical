**Product Registration & Online Support:** In order to improve our problem resolution process through better product and case tracking, PacketVideo's tech support department has implemented online product registration and technical support service. We require contact information and product serial number, license authorization code or other product-identifying information to identify your product. This information is used to manage your case, notify you when necessary of issues related to your product and, together with your voluntary responses to our marketing survey, it is used to analyze our customer base in aggregate. If you request, we may send you emails to give you information we think you will find useful, such as information about new features, products or promotions. When we email you, we will always provide instructions explaining how to unsubscribe so you will not receive our emails in the future.

**Contests & Promotions:** PacketVideo may occasionally sponsor sweepstakes, contests and promotions. If you request, we may use contact data from our promotions to send you information we think you will find useful, such as information about new products or promotions. When we email you, we will always provide instructions explaining how to unsubscribe, so you will not receive our emails in the future.

**Online Surveys:** Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like email address). This may be used to contact you if additional follow-up is appropriate, but will not be used for future marketing purposes, unless you so request and such use is explicitly stated.

**Email Newsletters:** PacketVideo may distribute various product-or topic-specific newsletters, which you may receive at your request. We require first name and last name, so that we may personalize your greeting, email address and in some cases your country, as not all offers are valid in all countries. Typically all other contact information is voluntary and, if you request, may be used to send other information or offers via mail. We do not share your information with third parties, except as required to deliver our message. Whenever we send a newsletter we will provide a method to subscribe and/or unsubscribe.

**Discussion List:** PacketVideo may host discussion lists or other moderated forums for users of PacketVideo software where users can help each other with technical and general questions. Topics for discussion include technical support questions and problems, sales information, suggestions for improvement, or anything else that relates to PacketVideo products or services. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in this area becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Opt-In/Unsubscribing:** PacketVideo will not send you any marketing communications unless you request PacketVideo to do so. We provide users the opportunity to opt-in to receive communications from us and/or our partners at the point where we request your information. Additionally, you may use one of the following options to request removal of your information from our databases. Please include the exact contact information you'd like removed and some detail about the type of communication you received from us.

**Information We Automatically Collect:** For each web visitor, we record date and time of visit, IP address and browser type to analyze how visitors use our site and to gather broad demographic information like country of origin and browser usage among our visitors. This information will not be matched against your personal information as supplied through all the means disclosed above. We may use cookies to track session information and site usage patterns. We are also reviewing the use of monitoring software to prevent the illegal downloads of our proprietary software from embargoed nations as specified in the Export Compliance Requirements set by the United States Federal Government. Updates to our Privacy Policy will be announced on our Web site.

**Privacy and Children:** PacketVideo and the PacketVideo web sites do not target children (defined as those persons under 13 years of age) as an audience or a market, and PacketVideo does not collect information about the age of its web site users. PacketVideo intends to comply with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child we will make all reasonable efforts to delete that data from our records.

**Security:** To protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. PacketVideo strives to protect the privacy of the information you provide, and inadvertent disclosure of that information is extremely unlikely. In the event of such an inadvertent disclosure, PacketVideo will do everything commercially reasonable to limit and remedy the disclosure, but PacketVideo accepts no liability for any unintentional disclosure. In addition, in the unlikely event that any government or private individual seeks information, PacketVideo will not voluntarily provide the information, but will obey any court order requiring disclosure.
