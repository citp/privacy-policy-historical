Twogag : Two Guys and Guy – Privacy Policy

Twogag Comic recognize that the privacy of an individuals personal information is important and does not, in anyway, attempt to extract your most personal of information from you. Twogag on the other hand does use different data tracking utilities to efficiently evaluate advertisement campaigns, link exchanges and social network sharing (Ie. where links are coming in from, such as twitter, facebook, etc). Here is information on what types of personal information Twogag receives and collects when you use and visit the site, and how it safeguards your information. Understand this, I WILL NOT SELL OR GIVE ANY data to any third party companies what so ever; data is ONLY collected for personal market research to improve the quality of content here at Twogag

Log Files  
Just like pretty much any other website, this site collects and uses the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or AT&T), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout the site. This helps me evaluate the effectiveness of my content as far as reader interest goes.

Cookies and Web Beacons  
Twogag uses cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit the site. This could include the ability to save your commenting information so you don’t have to type it over and over again, etc. As well as caching images so that you don’t have to wait for the entire page to reload every time you navigate to the next comic at the site.

Advertising  
Third party advertisements are a necessarily evil to keep the website up and running. Regardless of the fact that I’m sure you and I both would enjoy the design of the website a bit more with out the ads, they are the one thing keeping the website up; they essentially pay the bills! Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on the site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).  
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with Twogag website as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.
