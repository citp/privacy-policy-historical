                            When you interact with the Site or use our Services, our servers automatically receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information ("Log Data"). This Log Data is collected passively and may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the Site pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to provide you with the Services (for example, to provide push notifications on your mobile device) and pool it with other information to monitor the use of the Services, and for the technical administration of the Services. We do not associate your IP address with any other Personal Information to identify you personally, except in cases where we are asked to comply with a subpoena or other legal demand or where we suspect that there has been a violation of our policies, our Terms of Service and/or applicable law.
