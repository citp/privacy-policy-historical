<p><br>
The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live,  and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks,  you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate  with others from around the world. It's important to "Tweet Traffic Rush" to help our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of  all the Internet has to offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important to  you…and to us. So we'll protect the information you share with us. To protect  your privacy, "Tweet Traffic Rush" follows different principles in  accordance with worldwide practices for customer privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>We won’t sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email    address, credit card number or any other information to anyone.</li>
    <li>We’ll use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information    from unauthorized users.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>NOTICE</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you  (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally, this information  is requested when you create a Registration ID on the site or when you download  free software, enter a contest, order email newsletters or join a limited-access  premium site. We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information    more than once.</li>
    <li>To help you quickly find software, services or information.</li>
    <li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
    <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and    other new services from "Tweet Traffic Rush".</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CONSENT</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still  use most of TweetTrafficRush.com. But you will not be able to access areas  that require registration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of  information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various services, like  our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us to communicate with you about  other offers regarding "Tweet Traffic Rush" products, programs,  events, or services by email, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the  option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from "Tweet Traffic Rush".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tweet Traffic Rush" occasionally allows other companies to  offer our registered customers information about their products and services,  using postal mail only. If you do not want to receive these offers, you may  select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing materials  from third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ACCESS</b></p>
<p><br>
<br>
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is  correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at  the Visitor Center. There, you can:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>View and edit personal information you have already given us.</li>
    <li>Tell us whether you want us to send you marketing information, or whether    you want third parties to send you their offers by postal mail.</li>
    <li>Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products.</li>
    <li>Register. Once you register, you won't need to do it again. Wherever you    go on TweetTrafficRush.com, your information stays with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SECURITY</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tweet Traffic Rush" has taken strong measures to protect the  security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its  intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to protect your data from  loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and secure. When  you place orders or access your personal account information, you're utilizing a  secure server software SSL, which encrypts your personal information before it's  sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies  available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair Credit Billing  Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00  in fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for $50.00  or less, we'll cover your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of  your credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from purchases made  from us over our secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit  card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting  rules and procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tweet Traffic Rush" strictly protects the security of your  personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully  protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure,  alteration, or destruction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your  permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is  stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may  be stored and processed in Kenya or any other country where "Tweet Traffic Rush", its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can  see or edit your personal information without knowing your user name and  password, so do not share these with others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age  of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of  13, we will delete that information from our systems. TweetTrafficRush.com  encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help  make a child's online experience safer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent  or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. Look  for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ENFORCEMENT</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If for some reason you believe "Tweet Traffic Rush" has not  adhered to these principles, please notify us by clicking <a href="http://www.tweettrafficrush.com/contact-us.php">HERE</a>, and we will  do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words  Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your  purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information  with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your  personal profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we create a  personal profile for you from your product registration information. If you ever  want to review or update that information, you can visit the Profile Center,  click on Update Profile, and edit any of the Personal Information in your  profile. If you haven't already created a Registration ID, we will ask you to do  so. This ensures that only you can access your information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CUSTOMER PROFILES</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile.  Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us  ensure that only you can access your profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you register, we create your profile, assign a personal identification  number, then send this personal identification number back to your hard drive in  the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely  yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across TweetTrafficRush.com,  allowing you to download free software, order free newsletters, and visit  premium sites without having to fill out registration forms with information  you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to  re-register – just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including  your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about  your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and  announcements about new and exciting services that we offer. When you order from  us, we ask for your credit card number and billing address. We use this  information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time. For your  convenience, we do save billing information in case you want to order from us  again, but we don't use this information again without your permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our  behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering  customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail and  processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the  information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using  that information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Tweet Traffic Rush" will disclose your personal information,  without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief  that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply  with legal process served on "Tweet Traffic Rush" or the site; (b)  protect and defend the rights or property of "Tweet Traffic Rush"  and its family of Websites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the  personal safety of users of "Tweet Traffic Rush", its Websites, or  the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
