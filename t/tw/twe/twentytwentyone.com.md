# Security and Privacy | twentytwentyone

**Internet security technology**

When you place an order with us using our secure online order form and web browser such as Safari, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox etc, the order is encrypted. The use of SSL encryption scrambles data sent from the browser to the twentytwentyone.com server in a way that only twentytwentyone can access.

**Checking your browser security**

You will notice that when you look at the location (URL) field at the top of the browser it begins with https: instead of the normal http: This means that you are in secure mode. You can also verify the security of a document by checking the security icon at the bottom-right hand corner of your browser (usually a lock and key padlock or a solid gold key depending on your browser and version). This is your assurance that your browser and server are communicating securely. All information transmitted on our secure online order form is encrypted while in transit, so that even if the information is intercepted, because it is encrypted, it is useless to anyone. When our Secure Payment Server has received your credit card information it is sent directly and encrypted to the Sage Pay server and will never be stored or saved at the twentytwentyone.com website.  
Security of your personal data is of highest priority to us. This is why we have utilised encryption technology to guarantee unauthorised parties have no access to personal and credit card details as they are passed over the internet. This has been independently verified.

Also, under no circumstances will we pass on your personal details to any other company other than for the purpose of delivery of your order.

**Privacy policy**

twentytwentyone respects your privacy rights and recognises the importance of protecting the information we collect about you. Therefore we have adopted a Privacy Policy that guides how we collect, store and use the information that you provide us with. (This policy applies only to sites maintained by twentytwentyone and not to websites maintained by other companies or organisations to which we provide links to.)

**Personal information**

twentytwentyone only collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis, and only during registration or placing an order. Visitors purchasing goods and services online will need to provide a valid credit or debit card number and expiration date, in addition to their name, mailing address, telephone number (your telephone number may be given to our courier), and email address. These details allow us to process your order and to let you know the status of your order.

**How this information may be used**

When you register with twentytwentyone, you will be asked to provide personally identifiable information. The information you provide allows us to alert you to new products, services, special offers/promotions, news and events. We will not share your information with parties outside our organisation (except to the extent required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority.)

If at any point you wish to have your name removed from our database, you can do so.

**Safeguarding personal information**

We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and we will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided us with.
