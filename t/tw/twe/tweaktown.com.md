We also use third party advertisements on TweakTown to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.

 **Interest-based Advertising**

We use interest-based advertising which allows advertisers to show ads based on a user's previous interactions with them, such as visits to advertiser website and also to reach users based on their interests (e.g. "sports enthusiast"). To develop interest categories, our partner Google Adsense recognizes the types of web pages you visit throughout the Google content network. As an example, if you visit a number of sports pages, we will add you to the "sports enthusiast" interest category.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web Site.
