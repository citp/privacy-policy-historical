<h2>General Privacy Practices&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Tracking Technologies</h2>
<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>HubSpot also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files</p>
<p>There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by HubSpot. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by HubSpot for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the HubSpot website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>The HubSpot website uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize HubSpot pages, or register with HubSpot site or services, a cookie helps HubSpot to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same HubSpot website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the HubSpot features that you customized.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the HubSpot services or websites you visit. HubSpot keeps track of the websites and pages you visit within HubSpot, in order to determine what HubSpot services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within HubSpot to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
<h3>Flash Cookies and Other Third Party Tracking Technologies</h3>
<p>The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as "Flash cookies."</p>
<p>HubSpot does not use Flash cookies.&nbsp; However, our Clients of our software platform may create pages on the HubSpot platform that employ Adobe Flash cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <a href="http://hubspot.com/terms-of-use" title="Terms of Use" target="_self">Terms of Use</a> requires our Clients to inform you about their use of Flash cookies.&nbsp; HubSpot does not have access or control over our Clients' Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash management tools from&nbsp;Adobe’s web site&nbsp;directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, our&nbsp;Clients may create pages on the HubSpot platform that use technology from tracking utility companies, such as cookies and web beacons&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of these technologies by our&nbsp;Clients is not covered by our privacy statement.&nbsp; We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies.</p>
<h3>Advertising&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.&nbsp; Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.&nbsp; If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">http://preferences.truste.com/</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.&nbsp; You will continue to receive generic ads.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
<p>We employ [or our third party advertising partner employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie [do not tie] the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.&nbsp; This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.&nbsp; If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Tracking Technologies</span></b></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement.&nbsp; We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p>HubSpot websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on HubSpot or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of HubSpot (including enforcing this agreement); and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of HubSpot, or the public.</p>
<h3>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, request deletion on our site by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hubspot.com">privacy@hubspot.com</a> to our Privacy team.&nbsp; We will respond to all access requests within 30 days. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p>If you request that your user information be deleted from our records, there may be a brief delay in our processing that request, while verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party. If you request that your information be deleted, we reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the HubSpot website.</p>
<p>If you provide HubSpot with user information, you have the following rights with respect to that information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To review the user information that you have supplied to us</li>
<li>To request that we correct any errors, outdated information, or omissions in user information that you have supplied to us</li>
<li>To request that your user information not be used to contact you</li>
<li>To request that your user information be removed from any solicitation list that we use</li>
<li>To request that your user information be deleted from our records and</li>
<li>To opt out of being solicited by this website or third parties</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hubspot.com">privacy@hubspot.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>No method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. HubSpot uses a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. HubSpot secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) is collected on our site and/or transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hubspot.com">privacy@hubspot.com</a>.&nbsp; We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

HubSpot encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how HubSpot is protecting your information. When such a change is made, we will update the "Last Updated" date above.<b> </b>If we make any material changes we will notify you or our Client by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective.
