**Information We Collect Upon Registration:** In order to use certain parts of our site we require that you provide us with some basic personal information such as your Twitter user name, and Twitter password. We need your Twitter username and password because Twitter requires that we authenticate your Twitter credentials in order to send & receive information to Twitter on your behalf.

**Information We Collect From Twitter:** If you give us your Twitter username and password, we can and do access the information in your Twitter account as allowed according to the Twitter API. We do this in order to provide functionality for the Tweetizen service. This information may include Twitter messages you have sent, Twitter messages posted by people you're following, your direct messages, and public profile information.
