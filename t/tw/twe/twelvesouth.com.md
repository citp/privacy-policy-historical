_How Long Do We Store Your Personal Information?  _

We will retain your personal information as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.  We will retain and use your personal information as long as necessary to comply with our business requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, provide our services, and enforce our agreements. 

When we no longer have a purpose to retain your personal information, we will securely destroy your personal information in accordance with applicable law and our policies.  We take reasonable steps to delete the personal information we collect if your registration to use our Website lapses and you opt out of receiving further communications from us, or if you ask us to delete your information, unless we determine that doing so would violate our existing, legitimate legal, regulatory, dispute resolution, contractual, or similar obligations.  We may retain and use anonymous and aggregated information for performance reporting, benchmarking, and analytic purposes and for product and service improvement.

_Responding to Your Personal Information Requests_

We use commercially respond efforts to respond to all legitimate requests related to our processing of personal information within one month, unless a faster response is required by law. It also could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In such cases, we will notify you and keep you updated. 

There may be circumstances in which we need to ask you for more information to identify your account and verify your identity or else we may be unable to provide you with access to your personal information, including, but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and contact information to address any further inquiries you may have. 

The timeframes described here do not apply to our response times for addressing ordinary customer service and support requests unrelated to the exercise of personal information access rights.

_Security of Your Personal Information_

We maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent your personal information under our control from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized manner, altered or disclosed during collection, storage, and processing.  The particular safeguards used to protect personal information depend on the sensitivity of the personal information, the amount, distribution and format of the information, and the method of storage.

By using the Service or providing personal information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Service. If we learn of a security system’s breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically by posting a notice within the Service.  Access to your account and personal data and information is restricted within our organization to employees and trusted partners that need access to your personal information in order to correspond with you and provide the products and/or services that you requested from us.

While our security measures seek to protect your personal information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot guarantee that your personal information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances or that any privacy settings or security measures used in connection with the Services cannot be circumvented.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to circumvent those measures or other safeguards in use, or access and/or use your personal information for improper purposes.

The majority of communications on our Services, including any submissions through available forms, are sent through the standard HTTP protocol and may be delivered using regular e-mail. Information sent over HTTP is not encrypted. E-mail, while convenient, does pose some risks (e.g., e-mail is not a secure form of communication, is unreliable, can be forwarded, etc.).  Any transmission of information that you make through our Services is at your own risk. 

The safety and security of your personal information also depends on you. Where you use a password for access to restricted parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping the password confidential.  Do not share your password with anyone else.  If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our Services or systems that compromises your data, we will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are required to do so by applicable law. 

_Updating Your Personal Information_

If any of the personal information you have provided to us changes, please let us know. For instance, if your email changes, you wish to cancel any request you have made of us, or if you become aware of inaccurate personal information about you, please contact us to update your information.  You may also edit your account details if you have a user account through our Services. 

We are not responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete personal data that you provide to us.
