For example, Cookies that we use tell us how many times you have visited one of our sites, your search preferences, and if you have clicked on an advertisement that has been displayed to you. We use “persistent” Cookies to save your login information for future logins to our sites. We also use “session ID” Cookies to enable certain features of the sites, to better understand how you interact with the sites and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the sites. Unlike persistent Cookies, session ID Cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from a site and close your browser.

We (and third parties with whom we partner) may deliver Web Beacons or Pixel Tags to you through our sites. Web Beacons allow ad networks, marketing partners and other service providers that we use to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us, for advertisers and our other partners. Web Beacons also enable ad networks and other partners to track your behavior for their own analysis and use, and to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites or platforms. These Web Beacons enable third party companies to view, edit, or set their own Cookies when you visit the site, just as if you had visited a web page from their site.
