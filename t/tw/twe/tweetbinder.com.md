# Tweet Binder - Privacy

At Tweet Category S.L. (from now on, Tweet Binder) we take very serious your data protection and we are committed with their privacy. This update explains how Tweet Binder manages and storages the data it has from its users and clients. In this document you will also find how you can exercise your privacy rights. Notice that you can reach out to us directly by emailing [legal@tweetbinder.com](mailto:legal@tweetbinder.com) with any issues or questions regarding your data and how we use them.

### What data does Tweet Binder storages and why

Tweet Binder storages the minimum data necessary in order for its users and clients to use the platform and analyze terms on Twitter or Instagram.

We gather the following data of the free users that login Tweet Binder:

  * User’s Twitter Name
  * Name that user has given to Twitter
  * Number of followers of the user in the moment he does login
  * Location the user has given in Twitter
  * First login date
  * User’s Twitter token
  * Date of his last report
  * Reports generated in the platform
  * Profile picture of the user
  * Cookie of the browser



All these data are gathered through Twitter’s API. The login in Twee Binder with Twitter’s API is mandatory to be able to create reports. This is because Twitter Inc. obliges to access to public data (tweets tt go inside the report) through a Twitter account. At Tweet Binder we use the user’s account for that purpose. If the user wants to, he can as well provide us the following data:

  * Email
  * Company’s name
  * VAT number
  * Address
  * City
  * ZIP code
  * Country



This second round of data is not mandatory to create reports in the platform. Tweet Binder gives users the chance of providing these data so that if they want to purchase something in the future they don’t have to give them again.

From the clients (those who have at least purchased once a Tweet Binder product) Tweet Binder gathers the following data:

  * User’s Twitter Name
  * Name that user has given to Twitter
  * Number of followers of the user in the moment he does login
  * Location the user has given in Twitter
  * First login date
  * User’s Twitter token
  * Date of his last report
  * Reports generated in the platform
  * Profile picture of the user
  * Email
  * Company
  * VAT number
  * Address
  * City
  * ZIP code
  * Country
  * Cookie of the browser



These data are necessary to generate the reports and the invoices of the purchases.

About the payment methods, Tweet Binder does not storage any data at the moment (credit cards, PayPal accounts, etc.). This function is delegated in the payment platform BrainTree, property of PayPal. This platform keeps those data secure.

Tweet Binder access through Twitter’s API to public data (those data visible to any kind of user) of each tweet and user who has tweeted with the term analyzed in the report. The data gathered and analyzed by Tweet Binder are the ones obtained through the API and that can be found here: <https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/tweet-objectTweet> Binder deletes the information of the reports after 7 days.

All the information gathered about a tweet is necessary to create the well-known Tweet Binder reports. These reports analyze the impact and reach of a hashtag, account or keyword on Twitter.
