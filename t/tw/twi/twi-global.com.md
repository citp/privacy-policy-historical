**How to control and delete cookies**

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but you do not have to accept cookies and you can, should you choose at any time, reject or block the use of cookies and delete all cookies stored on your device. 

TWI does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you. We use them to help us provide you with a better service. However, if you wish to restrict or block any cookies you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how. 

For example, this is how it can be achieved in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0:

  * Press the ‘F1’ key 

  * The Help function appears. Type in ‘cookie’ in the Help search box and follow the instructions




You can also delete cookies in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 by: 

  * Selecting 'Tools/Internet Options' 

  * Clicking on 'Delete' in the Browsing History section

  * Then select 'delete cookies'. 




In addition to this, options to accept, block, or require notification for the use of cookies are found under: 

  * 'Tools/Internet Options/Privacy/Advanced'. 




Please be aware however that if you choose to block cookies you may not be able to access certain features of this web site. For rejecting and deleting cookies on other web browsing platforms and mobile devices you may need to refer to your software or device manual.

[AboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/ "About Cookies Advice") or  [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ "All About Cookies Advice") are independent sites which offers a guide to the use of cookies online.

Please note that TWI is not responsible for the content of third party website sites but has provided these links in good faith to help you make an informed decision about your online privacy and cookie settings.

It may be that your concerns about cookies are related to malicious spyware. Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.
