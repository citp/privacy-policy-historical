**Twitgoo Privacy Policy**

Effective as of March 1, 2009

Photobucket, Inc. ("Twitgoo" or "we") operates Twitgoo.com (the "Site"), which allows users to upload images, and videos and associate them with a unique URL to create online access to the images and videos for themselves and others, both on the Site and on other websites where the user posts the URL ("quick link feature"). This Privacy Policy describes Twitgoo's use and sharing of personally identifiable information ("PII"-- your full name or email address,) that Members voluntarily provide to Twitgoo when they register or update the Settings part of their Profile (also known as "Registration PII"). The Term "User" refers to a Visitor or a Member. This Privacy Policy applies to the services offered by Twitgoo, which may include the Site, image and video sharing (including the quick link feature), other features (for example, image editor), and any other features, content, mobile services, Twitgoo branded URLs or applications offered from time to time by Twitgoo in connection with Twitgoo's business (collectively, the "Twitgoo Services"). 

The Site is a general audience site and Twitgoo does not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. ****

From time to time Twitgoo may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of the Twitgoo Services, or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting by Twitgoo on the Site. Your continued use of the Twitgoo Services after Twitgoo posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. It is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. If Twitgoo materially changes its practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change. ****

COLLECTION OF PII BY Twitgoo 

_General_. When Twitgoo collects PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting PII to us in order to register as a Member of Twitgoo. Twitgoo may also collect PII from you if you choose to participate in Twitgoo Services activities like sweepstakes, contests, games and surveys, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services, newsletters, or information, or in connection with content or suggestions you submit to Twitgoo for review. Other PII including first and last name and mobile telephone numbers may also be collected. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.

In addition, Twitgoo collects other non-PII including IP address, aggregate user data, and browser type. This data is used to manage and improve the Twitgoo Services, track usage, and for security purposes. 

Twitgoo Members may also choose to provide or store non-PII information in their profiles, including but not limited to groups with whom they are affiliated, videos and/or pictures, (collectively "Profile Information"). The Profile Information in a Member's profile is provided at his or her sole discretion.

Twitgoo Members can change their Registration PII and Profile Information at any time by controlling their account settings, available within the settings portion of their Twitgoo profile. 

_Cookies_. Cookies are small bits of information that Twitgoo places on your computer. Twitgoo uses cookies to identify your Internet browser, store Users' preferences, and to determine whether you have installed the enabling software needed to access certain material on the Twitgoo Services. Data in cookies may be read to authenticate user sessions or provide services.

Third-party advertisements displayed on Twitgoo Services may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. Twitgoo does not control these cookies and Users of the Twitgoo Services should check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. See the "Notice" section below for more information on third-party advertising.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on the Twitgoo Services.

NOTICE: Twitgoo WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When you voluntarily provide PII to Twitgoo, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses Twitgoo will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy. 

At the time you provide your PII, Twitgoo will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII (See "Choice" below). Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Twitgoo will not share your PII with third parties unless you have given Twitgoo permission to do so (See "Use" below).

Twitgoo Services may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Twitgoo Services may also carry advertisements from other companies. Twitgoo is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Twitgoo Services or for the privacy practices of third-party Internet advertising companies. Once you leave Twitgoo Services via such a link, or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

Twitgoo Services may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with Twitgoo (i.e., that are part of the News America Group: "Affiliated Companies"). Although all Affiliated Companies adhere to the [News America corporate Privacy Principles](http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html), Users who visit those Affiliated Company sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.

Twitgoo may use cookies and similar tools to customize the content and advertising you receive based on the Profile Information you have provided. Profile Information you provide in structured profile fields or questions (multiple choice questions like "Language") and other non-PII about you may also be used to customize the online ads you encounter to those we believe are aligned with your interests. The information used for this feature does not provide your PII or identify you as an individual to third parties. ****

Some of the advertisements that appear on the Site are delivered to you by third party Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect non-PII about your visit to or use of Twitgoo Services, including information about the ads they display, via a cookie placed on your computer that reads your IP address. To opt out of information collection by these companies, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit: [http:www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt-out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt-out.asp)

Third party applications (such as widgets) created by third party developers may also be available on or in connection with the Twitgoo Services. Third party applications are small bits of software, often with interactivity, that users may be able to install into profiles, use to access the Twitgoo Services, or share with other Users. However, Twitgoo does not control the third party developers, and cannot dictate their actions. When a Member engages with a third party application, that Member is interacting with the third party developer, not with Twitgoo. Twitgoo encourages Members not to provide PII to the third party's application unless the Member knows the party with whom it is interacting. 

CHOICE: Twitgoo WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Twitgoo will get your permission before we use the PII you provide to us in a way that is inconsistent with the purpose for which it was submitted or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Twitgoo.

USE: Twitgoo's USE OF PII

Twitgoo will only use the PII you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If Twitgoo obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is also governed by this Privacy Policy. 

In order to locate other Twitgoo Members that you may already know in the physical world, Twitgoo allows Users to search for Members using Members' email addresses). If you have consented to receive promotional materials from Twitgoo, Twitgoo may periodically use your email address to send you such notifications related to the Twitgoo Services. If you want to stop receiving such promotional materials from Twitgoo, click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each promotional email. 

Twitgoo employees, agents and contractors must have a business reason to obtain access to your PII. Twitgoo may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., message boards, sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes.

These outside contractors, agents or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your PII to provide Twitgoo with a specific service and not for any other purpose without your consent. Twitgoo may also provide your PII to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your PII. Twitgoo also may share your PII with Affiliated Companies if it has a business reason to do so. ****

As described in "Notice" above, Twitgoo may customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on the Site, or may work with outside companies to do so. Your non-PII may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. Twitgoo prohibits these companies from sharing your information with any third party or from using it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream, number of page views calculated by pixel tags, and aggregated demographic information may also be shared with Twitgoo's advertisers and business partners. ****

There may be instances when Twitgoo may access or disclose PII or non-PII without providing you with a choice in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Twitgoo, our Affiliated Companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Users of the Twitgoo Services or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Twitgoo sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Twitgoo may transfer your PII to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.

If you register to use the Site, you may designate your Profile as "Private". ** __** Profiles designated as "Private" will not be accessible to anyone but the Member although individual images or video may still be viewable by anyone with access to the URL associated with the image or video (whether on Twitgoo or as displayed elsewhere via the quick link feature). 

SECURITY: Twitgoo PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII

Twitgoo uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII and credit card information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Twitgoo uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. 

ACCESS, REMEDIES AND COMPLIANCE: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR CHANGE YOUR PREFERENCES REGARDING YOUR PII AND HOW TO CONTACT Twitgoo ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS

Whenever possible, Twitgoo Members may review the Registration PII we maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a Member informs us is incorrect. If you are a Member, you can view and change your Registration PII, Member preferences and Profile Information by logging into the settings portion of your Twitgoo account.
