                        <b class="bold">(1) What information do we collect?</b><br>
                        We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:<br>
                        (a) information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP address, geographical location,
                        browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views);<br>
                        (b) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering with us (including your personal details and email address);<br>
                        (c) information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our website services, email notifications and/or newsletters
                        (including your personal details and email address);<br>
                        (d) any other information that you choose to send to us;<br><br>
                        <b class="bold">(2) Cookies</b><br>
                        A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to
                        the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.<br>
                        We may use both “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies on the website. We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you
                        whilst you navigate the website; We will use the persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognize you when you visit; and you
                        store the last played games by you.<br>
                        Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer
                        until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.<br>
                        We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website
                        use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create
                        reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at:<br>
                        http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.<br>
                        Our advertisers/payment services providers may also send you cookies.<br>
                        Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools”,
                        “Internet Options”, “Privacy”, and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact
                        upon the usability of many websites.<br><br>
