# Twinkl User Privacy & Data Protection Policies

## A message from Jon Seaton, Twinkl's CEO, about our commitment to your security and privacy.

At Twinkl, your trust means **everything** to us. That’s why we respect your privacy, protect it with commercial encryption and ensure that there are strict policies that govern how all data is handled.

We believe in telling you up front exactly what’s going to happen to your personal information and asking for your permission before you share it with us. And if you change your mind later, we make it easy to stop sharing with us. When we do ask to use your data, it’s to provide you with a better user experience and to be even more helpful to you.

Daily site scans for vulnerabilities and malware/viruses are undertaken by a leading specialist third party, Norton, and we have passed Extended Validation vetting checks designed to verify, and provide assurance, to our users of the legitimacy of our website and business. You can verify our current Secure Site status anywhere on the site where you see the Norton Site Seal.

Our business model is very straightforward: we sell beautifully designed and unique products, and we rely on you to purchase from us. We don’t build a profile based on your web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. Our website and services are designed to make the site experience and our teaching materials, better. Plain and simple.

Our commitment to protecting your privacy comes from the fact that Twinkl is a unique business – driven by teachers, for teachers. We know that your trust doesn’t come easily. That’s why we have and always will work as hard as we can to earn and keep it.

We ask that you continue to support and promote our hard work and beautiful teaching materials and we will continue to support you in every way we can. **We care about you.** We care about the children you teach and the path that education is taking. We’re here to support and fight with you in every step of that journey – that’s our promise.

Jon
