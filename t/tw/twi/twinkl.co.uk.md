We collect different types of information about our users for the following main reasons:

  1. To provide an interactive web site where email is used to communicate with the users.
  2. To help us to improve the website.



## Our principles

We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. Our policy can be summarised in one sentence: **we will not share your information with others without your consent**.

## What information do we collect?

We collect information on our users through contact forms and via visitor tracking software.

## Who will have access to your information?

Only you and our staff will be able to see your information.

## What else you should know about privacy

Remember to log out and close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. You as an individual are responsible for the security of, and access to, your own computer.

Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information over the Internet that this information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information in publicly accessible online forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your usernames and passwords and any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are using the Internet.

Our pages may contain links to other websites, and you should be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices on other websites.

These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>
