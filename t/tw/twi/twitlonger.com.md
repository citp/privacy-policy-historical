# TwitLonger — When you talk too much for Twitter

#### Summary

We promise to be nice. 

#### Privacy

Important. Your Twitter privacy settings are not reflected in TwitLonger. If your updates are private in Twitter it does not mean your TwitLonger posts are private. This includes Direct Messages. It is not recommended that you try to use TwitLonger for sending DMs. 

OK, basic terms of privacy for the site. We store messages indefinitely (that means forever, or the closest approximation the site makes it to). Messages can be deleted in the “Account” section of the site (look up in the menu __, there's a link there). When a message is deleted, it is really, properly deleted, we will not be able to get it back for you. We will not “back it up” on the chance you change your mind. It may be backed up as part of our standard hosting company's service in case of hard drive failures, but not in any sinister, tracking you way.

We store your Twitter username, your Twitter display name and the link to your Twitter avatar and background. We do not store passwords since we use OAuth to access your Twitter account. 

#### What we do with your information

Nothing. Really. We use it to post to Twitter and that's it. We use cookies to keep you logged in and to perform the normal working of the site. We collect statistics on visitors through Google Analytics and serve ads via a number of popular ad platforms who may set their own cookies, but we don't do any keyword processing for our own edification. If you do not wish to have third party cookies set, you should use the settings provided in your browser's preferences to block these cookies. 

We will hand over information on request to any law enforcement authority, specifically IP address, but seriously, what are the chances of us ever needing to do that? 

We _definitely_ won't sell, pass on, redistribute or otherwise make available information to third parties, unless we get acquired, in which case the acquiring company will obviously get the messages when they take over the site. Third party Twitter clients and sites will be able to display the content of your posts via the TwitLonger API as part of their normal operation. Copyright is retained with the original author. If you post any good jokes we might use them in the pub on Friday night. 

#### Guarantee/Uptime

We make no promise the service will be available at any specific time or for any specific duration. We do not guarantee your messages will be available, nor do we guarantee they won't magically disappear. If they're that important, grab a copy of them. We reserve the right to remove any and all parts of the service at any time and without warning. 

But we promise to be nice. 

#### Advertising

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioural advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).
