# TwitterCounter Privacy Policy

TwitterCounter Privacy Policy
TwitterCounter (“Service”), a service by The Next Web Holding BV (“TNW”), collects public data about
Twitter accounts, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information
on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey
information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web
pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial
purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under
the following circumstances:
     •    It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
          activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
          person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
     •    We transfer information about you if TNW or TwitterCounter is acquired by or merged with
          another company. In this event, TNW will notify you before information about you is transferred
          and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

          provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research.
     •    Credit card information will never be stored by TNW, Twittercounter or on TNW servers, but by a
          third party payment provider.
