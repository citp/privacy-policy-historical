## Privacy Notice 

Last modified on **9/9/12**

Welcome to the web site www.twitch.tv, and any other web sites, applications, or services that link to this Privacy Notice (collectively, the “ **Twitch Service** ”), which sites, applications or services are operated or produced by Justin.tv, Inc. dba Twitch (“ **Twitch** ”). Twitch values the privacy of the users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit and use the Twitch Service (collectively or individually, “ **You** ” or “ **Users** ”). 

By using the Twitch Service, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this notice. 

This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Twitch Service Terms of Service. Your use of the Twitch Service and any personal information you provide through the Twitch Service are subject at all time to this Privacy Notice and the Terms of Service. 

#### The Information Twitch Collects 

  * **User-provided Information** : You may provide to Twitch what is generally called “personally identifiable” information (such as your name, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile telephone number, credit card number and billing information) if you upload, purchase, or view or download certain content or products from the Twitch Service, enter contests or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Twitch Service. 

  * **“Cookies” Information** : When you access the Twitch Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Twitch may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Twitch Service. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. We may also use Adobe Flash cookies in compliance with [Network Advertising Initiative] standards. The Adobe Flash Player is an application and web tool that allows rapid development of dynamic content. Flash (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. Adobe Flash cookies may be used by us where we use Flash to provide video content. You may access your Flash management tools to manage or remove such cookies. 

  * **“Automatically Collected” Information** : When you access the Twitch Service or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This “automatically collected” information may include Internet Protocol address (“ **IP Address** ”), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the Twitch Service, and the dates and times that you visit the Twitch Service. 

  * **Information from Other Sources** : We may obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than the Twitch Service, such as advertisers or social media networks for which you have approved our access to information (e.g., information from your Facebook account provided by the Facebook APIs). If we combine or associate information from such other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through the Twitch Service, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

#### The Way Twitch Uses Information 

  * Twitch uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Twitch Service as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 

  * We will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Twitch Service updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Twitch Service. 

  * Twitch uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Twitch Service works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.

#### When Twitch Discloses Information 

  * Twitch is not in the business of sharing your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Twitch Service – such as when you publish content, comments or profile information – becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction. 

  * Twitch may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information with interested third parties to assist such parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality of Twitch. 

  * We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Twitch in improving the Twitch Service and creating new services features. We require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Notice, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures. 

  * Twitch may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity. 

  * Twitch also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; protect Twitch from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Twitch Service; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Twitch, our Users, or others.

#### Your Choices 

You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Twitch, in which case Twitch will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Twitch Service. You may update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences by clicking on the “Edit Settings” link on the top left of the page once you have logged in to the Twitch Service. 

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

#### Advertisers 

Twitch may allow advertisers, third party advertising networks and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within the Twitch Service and other Twitch sites, services and software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Twitch does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Twitch to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. 

Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative (" **NAI** "), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks here: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/>. 

This Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Twitch reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and Twitch may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Notice.

#### Our Commitment to Data Security 

Twitch uses certain physical, managerial, and technical measures designed to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Twitch, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Twitch makes efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. 

If Twitch learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Twitch may post a notice on the Twitch Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

If Twitch learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Twitch Service, then Twitch will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. 

If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become Twitch Service member, then please contact Twitch at privacy@twitch.tv to have that child’s account terminated and information deleted.
