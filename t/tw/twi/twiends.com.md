2\. Our lawful basis

We rely on legitimate interests as our lawful basis for processing personal data. Different legitimate interests apply for each category of personal data that we process. These are described in the next section. We have also published the full [legitimate interests assessments](https://web.archive.org/lia) that were used to check the validity of these as a lawful basis for processing personal data. 

3\. The personal data that we process

We have grouped the personal data that we process into multiple categories. Each has a different level of privacy, and the processing that applies to each is different too.

3a. Twitter Information

This personal data refers to all the publically available information you place on twitter. This includes all your profile information, such as name, username, bio, photo, location, etc. It includes the status updates and media that you share on twitter, known as tweets. It does not include private information such as direct messages, private updates, and private profile info. 

It is in the legitimate interest of all stakeholders that public twitter information be displayed on our website to help everyone create better connections on twitter. You receive more exposure for your profile, we are able to provide a directory service, and the wider public receives the benefit of this directory. It is a legitimate interest that you be able to find the most relevant profiles to connect with through the use of this data. The data is collected legitimately via the twitter API in accordance to their policy, and only public data is processed. 

We assess this legitimate interest to be a sound lawful basis for processing public twitter information. We have assessed the risks to yourself to be very low and we have provided a safeguard by allowing you to remove this data should you wish. Your interests are aligned with ours in the processing of this data. 

3b. Email Addresses

This personal data refers to any email address provided by yourself, obtained from twitter, or set up during subscription creation. We treat this personal data separately because it is generally considered private. It has different legitimate interests to public data. 

We have a legitimate business interest to communicate with our users. We want to be able to provide you with important information about your account when the need arises. We also want to be able to provide you with email copies of invoices if you are a paying customer. Email addresses are also used to identify subscribers with some payment providers, such as PayPal. You receive a benefit by being informed about important changes to your service, and by receiving payment records. We also use email to provide customer support and respond to customer queries. It is in your best interest to receive support as quickly as possible. 

These legitimate interests are a sound lawful basis for processing email addresses privately and securely. We have provided a safeguard by allowing you to opt-out of email addresses being processed should you wish. In addition to collecting and storing email address, we also comply with PECR requirements when sending email. 

3c. IP Address, Device Info, Usage Data

This personal data refers to the IP address and other information we receive about your browser, such as the type, user agent string, and cookies. It also includes the usage information we collect and log about your visits. We process this data in order to provide better security and monitoring of the service. It is in our legitimate interest to ensure that users are conforming to rules and policy, not just for us but for twitter too. 

We also want to process this information in order to reduce payment fraud. Processing this data allows us to improve the quality of our service by being able to identify and remove bots and fake accounts. This is essential in order for us to comply with twitter policy. It also allows us to identify security issues, such as hacking attempts. We also conduct long-term analysis of this data in order to improve the service. This data helps us to provide support to you by being able to analyse what is occurring in your account and to determine how to fix it. 

You benefit from this data being processed by receiving a more secure and higher quality service. As fraud is reduced you see lower shared costs. These legitimate interests are a lawful basis for processing this data. 

3d. Payment Information

This personal data refers to the payment information we process if you are a paying customer. It includes information about your payment sources, but does not include sensitive information such as full credit card numbers. Sensitive information is processed securely by our payment providers, PayPal and Stripe. If you are paying via PayPal then we will process your PayPal email address. If you are paying by card then we will include partial information to identify the source, such as the last 4 digits of the card, card type, and zip code. It also includes a history of payments made. We consider all of this data to be private. 

We have a legitimate business interest in making subscription management as easy and seamless as possible for you. We do this by giving you full visibility of your payment agreements, and past payment history. We also provide you with the means to start and stop subscriptions immediately. We are required to process this payment information in order to achieve this. We are also compelled to process some of this data for tax purposes. 

Processing payment information is in our joint interests. It is legitimate and a lawful basis for doing so. We also provide extra safeguards by allowing you to delete your payment information. In this instance we will delete all your payment data except for the historical data we are required to retain for the tax authorities. 

3e. Interest Categories

This personal data refers to the interests that you can add to your profile, eg. sport, music, politics. This data is considered public because it is made public by yourself, or added using public records. As an example, Justin Bieber is publically known to be a musician, and as such will have the music interest added to their directory listing. Private information is not used for this purpose. 

We have a legitimate interest in processing these interest categories so that people can find twitter profiles that are in their niche. We have decided to treat this data as special category data as per Article 6 of the GDPR because it may include information about potential sensitive categories, such as politics, religion, sexual orientation, etc. 

We may process this special category data on the condition that it relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject. Processing this data meets this condition and has the legitimate interest described above as a lawful basis for processing. 

4\. Retention period

We retain personal data only for as long as it is needed. This means that the personal data listed above is retained based on it's legitimate interest usefulness, and whether it is still valid. In the case of twitter information, this is considered to be always useful for the directory while the data is still publically available. Should the data be removed from Twitter it will be removed from twiends too. We will also remove it you ask us to. 

In the case of email addresses we retain these indefinitely, but stop sending emails to them if your account becomes dormant. The reason we retain these is that this is often the only way you can recover your account if you have been gone a long time and forget your password. By retaining your email address we are able to send you recovery information so that you can gain access to your account again. 

For IP Address, device info, and usage data we may retain some of this indefinitely. As an example, an IP address that has been blacklisted my be kept forever. But most other data is retained for less than 5 years, eg. detailed usage logs. Some high level analysis data is retained indefinitely, but this is not linked to your account and is retained in unidentifiable aggregated form. 

For payment information we use different retention cycles. For historic payment data we retain this indefinitely so that you are always able to download invoices for past payments. For payment agreements these are deleted immediately when you delete your subscription. 

5\. Protecting your privacy

We use the latest technologies and processes to ensure that any information (personal data) that you supply us is kept secure at all times.

This policy (together with our [Terms](https://web.archive.org/terms) and any other documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.
