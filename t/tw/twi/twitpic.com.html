      <strong>Twitpic Privacy Policy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how and when Twitter, Inc. and Twitter International Company (collectively, "Twitter"), collect, use, and share your personal information when you use the Twitpic website or otherwise access content on Twitpic (the "<strong>Services</strong>"). When using our Services, you acknowledge the practices and policies described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of the effective date of this policy, the Services only allow access to archives of images, text, and other materials that users previously uploaded to the Services and posted publicly (collectively referred to as "<strong>Archived Content</strong>"). All other features of the Services are disabled and we retain no non-public user information except for information necessary to display Archived Content and otherwise operate our Services. In accordance with our <a href="http://twitpic.com/static/tos">Terms of Service</a> ("<strong>Terms</strong>"), users of the Services can view Archived Content but no longer have the ability to create a Twitpic account, log into a Twitpic account, or post new content.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Information Collection </strong>
    </p>
    <div class="tab">
      <p>
        <strong>Public Content: </strong>Twitpic is an image sharing platform through which Twitpic users were able to share images and other information with a wide range of users and other services that accessed Twitpic. Archived Content remains publicly accessible to visitors of the website. We do not update the Services and you no longer have the ability to post new content. Twitpic will continue to host this information until we receive a request to delete such data in accordance with the instructions provided below or as required by law (see "<strong>Deleting Your Personal Information / Your Rights</strong>" below).
      </p>
      <p>

        <strong>Personal Information You Provide:</strong> You may provide personal information to us, for example when you request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, and any other information you choose to provide. We use this information to respond to your questions or concerns. The Twitpic website does not collect or allow the submission of personal information.
      </p>
      <p>

        <strong>Personal Information We Collect</strong>: When you visit Twitpic or otherwise interact with our Services, our servers automatically record information from your use of the Services ("<strong>Log Data</strong>"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and pages visited. We use Log Data to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <strong>Purposes and Legal Bases</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We use information we receive from you for the purposes described below, except where restricted by law. In doing so, Twitter relies on its legitimate interests to lawfully process such data:
    </p>
    <div class="tab">
      <p>
        <strong>Archiving Content in the Public Interest</strong>: Twitter hosts Archived Content. We do this to preserve our users' historic speech and to preserve access to content that was publicly posted on the internet. This furthers our users' right to free expression and the right of members of the public to access public speech. We remove Archived Content where requested by the individual who posted it (see "<strong>Deleting Your Personal Information / Your Rights</strong>" below).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Operating Our Site</strong>: Twitter may also use your information as necessary to pursue our legitimate interests of enforcing our Terms of Service and preventing unlawful activities and misuse of the Services; protecting the legal rights, property, safety, and security of Twitter and our users; and resolving disputes involving you relating to the Services. Twitter may also use your personal information where reasonably necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or governmental requests.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong>
    </p>
    <div class="tab">
      <p>
        <strong>User-Controlled Sharing</strong>: Archived Content can be collected and used by others and redistributed through the internet and other media channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Service Providers</strong>: We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Ireland, and other countries. We may share information with such service providers on the condition that they use the data only on our behalf, pursuant to our instructions, and subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Law, Harm, and the Public Interest</strong>: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect Twitter's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a government's, request to disclose your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Change of Ownership and Affiliates</strong>: In the event Twitter is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information to our corporate affiliates in order to help operate our services and our affiliates' services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>: We may share or disclose aggregated or otherwise non-personal information.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <strong>Our Global Operations and Privacy Shield</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring you our services, we operate globally. Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your data in the United States, Ireland, and any other country where we operate. In some of the countries to which we transfer personal data, the privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those of your country. Learn more about our global operations and data transfer <a href="https://help.twitter.com/rules-and-policies/global-operations-and-data-transfer">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we transfer personal data outside of the European Union or EFTA States, we ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects based on the adequacy of the receiving country's data protection laws, contractual obligations placed on the recipient of the data (model clauses may be requested by inquiry as described below), or EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twitter, Inc. complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield principles (the "Principles") regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal data from the European Union and Switzerland, as described in our <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO">EU-US Privacy Shield certification and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certification</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact us <a href="https://help.twitter.com/forms/privacy">here</a>. As part of our participation in Privacy Shield, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the independent dispute resolution body <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">JAMS</a>, and under certain conditions, through the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=G-Arbitration-Procedures">Privacy Shield arbitration process</a>. Privacy Shield participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU or Switzerland to third parties outside the EU and Switzerland. Learn more about the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Retention</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope (but assume no obligation) to maintain Archived Content indefinitely. We retain Log Data for no longer than 18 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Deleting Your Personal Information / Your Rights</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you reside in certain territories, including the European Union or EFTA States, you benefit from a number of rights in relation to your information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. We describe these rights below:
    </p>
    <div class="tab">
      <p>
        <strong>Access</strong>. The Archived Content we process in relation to the Service is public, so it can be freely accessed online.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Change, Restrict, Delete</strong>. You may also have rights to change, restrict our use of, or delete your personal data. As the data we hold is archived, we may be limited in our ability to change or restrict the use of your data. However, absent exceptional circumstances (like where we are required to store data for legal reasons) we will generally delete your personal data upon request. Please contact us <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitpic">here</a> to request the deletion of your content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Object</strong>. As we process your information based on our legitimate interests, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will delete your personal data unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Complain</strong>. If you reside in the European Union or EFTA States, should you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority or with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner whose contact details can be found <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Contact-us/b/11.htm">here</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      <strong>Our Policy Towards Children</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service is not directed to persons under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal data, we will delete such information from our systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. Each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
