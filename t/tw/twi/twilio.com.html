<h2>Twilio Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Your privacy is important, so Twilio has created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit our website, why we collect it and how it is used.</p>

<p>The terms "you," "your," and "yours" refer to the customer using our website.  The terms "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Twilio. This Privacy Policy is governed by our <a href="/legal/tos">Terms of Service</a>. By using this website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy frequently and remain informed about any changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often.</p>

<h4>What Information Is Collected?</h4>

<p>"Personally identifiable information" means any information that may be used to identify
an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical
address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work
or at home. When you use our website or services Twilio may collect from you the
following personally identifiable information: first and last name, city, state and zip
code, email address, birthday and phone number. Twilio also automatically receives and
records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address,
cookie information and the page you request. You can choose not to provide us with
certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our
features.</p>

<p>Twilio may keep a cached copy of the content you serve us as a part of your use of the
service for an indeterminate amount of time, including media files and XML files. To
assist in development, we may keep copies of HTTP requests and responses in your
notification log, available only to you. If your web server does not specify that we can
cache your content, we will not keep a cached copy of any text or audio data transmitted
through our service during calls, but we may still maintain copies in your notification
log. If data privacy is a concern, make sure your server does not allow us to cache such
content, and contact us so that we may turn off other application logging around requests
to and responses from your application. We may keep call log, notification log, billing/
payment, and other log data for at least six months from the date of entry.</p>

<h4>How Is Such Information Used?</h4>

<p>Twilio uses the personally identifiable and other collected information in a manner that
is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide personally identifiable information
for a certain reason, we may use the personally identifiable information in connection
with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we
will use the personally identifiable information you provide to answer your question
or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide personally identifiable information in
order to obtain access to the Twilio website or services, we will use such information
to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
Your personally identifiable information may be used to provide you with new product
information and support services offered on the website, to notify you of technical
updates or changes in policy, to improve the content and functionality of the Twilio
website and services, to help us better understand our users, or to deliver other services.</p>

<h4>Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?</h4>

<p>Twilio is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to
be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in
which we may share your personally identifiable information with certain third parties
without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Third Party Applications and Services:</strong> 
If you elect to use one or more third
party applications that interoperate with Twilio’s service via Twilio Connect, those
applications may upon your election be given access to data (which may include
personally identifiable information) on Twilio’s systems generated in connection with
your use of Twilio’s service. Please remember that Twilio is not responsible for the
policies and practices of third party application providers, and Twilio shall have no
liability arising from any action of any such provider as it concerns your data or
information or otherwise. In connection with your use of any such third party
applications, please review carefully the applicable privacy policies each such third party
application provider to become familiar with their policies and practices as it concerns
your data and information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy
businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution
or similar event, personally identifiable information may be part of the transferred assets.
You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer or successor of
Twilio may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Related Companies:</strong>
We may also share your personally identifiable information
with any entity that is affiliated with us for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong>
Twilio, like many businesses,
sometimes uses other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples
of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing
payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we
only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Legal Requirements and Other Circumstances:</strong>
Twilio may disclose your
personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief
that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend
the rights or property of Twilio, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal
safety of users of the Twilio website or services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal
liability.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Access</h4>

<p>In the event that you have volunteered personally identifiable information, you may correct or amend that information by editing your account <a href="/user/account">profile</a> or email us at privacy@twilio.com</p>

<h4>The Security of Your Information</h4>

<p>We will take reasonable precautions to protect personally identifiable information in
our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
destruction. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally
identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is, however,
100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect
your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h4>Children</h4>

<p>Twilio is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 13.  Any person who provides their information to Twilio represents to us that they are 13 years of age or older.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>Cookies are small text files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit our website.  Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information.  Most browsers will accept cookies until you change your browser settings to refuse them.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Twilio and does not cover the use of cookies by any other third party.</p>

<h4>Forums and Comments</h4>

<p>If you use the forum or post comments on this website, you should be aware that any
personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by
other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Twilio
is not responsible for any personally identifiable information you choose to submit in that
context or anything arising from such submissions.</p>

<h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>

<p>This website may contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by us.
Please be aware that Twilio is not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites.
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements
of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy
policy applies only to information collected by this website.</p>

<h4>Your Consent To This Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>By using Twilio, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive
Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our <a href="/legal/tos">Terms of Service</a> take
precedence over any conflicting Privacy Policy provision. We may change this Privacy
Policy by posting a new version of this Privacy Policy on this website which it is your
responsibility to review. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy
to stay informed about how we are protecting the personally identifiable information
we collect. Your continued use of this website or Twilio’s services constitutes your
agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>

<h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>

<p>Twilio operates "AS-IS" and "AS-AVAILABLE," without liability of any kind.  Twilio is not responsible for events beyond our direct control.</p>

<h4>Contacting Twilio</h4>

<p>If you believe that Twilio has not adhered to this Privacy Policy, please contact us by email at privacy@twilio.com or by postal mail at Twilio Inc., 548 Market St #14510, San Francisco California 94104 and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the problem.</p>
