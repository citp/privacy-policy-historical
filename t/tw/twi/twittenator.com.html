used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages
viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">How Do We Use the

<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">What Are
Cookies?</font></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><br>
<font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique
identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in
a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your
browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site
to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually
set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of your
browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our
site will not function as effectively when viewed by the users.</font></span><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif"><font size="2"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt">A cookie cannot retrieve
any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.</span></strong></font></font></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">How Do We Use
Information We Collect from Cookies?</font></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><br>
<font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to differentiate you
from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary
for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number
of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback to
constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal
information about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information that your browser provided to us
in your cookies.</font></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">IP
Addresses</font></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><br>
<font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet.
Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are
automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that
data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.</font></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><font face="Arial, Sans-Serif">Sharing and Selling
Information</font></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><br>

identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is
necessary to process transactions or provide services that you have requested.</font></span></p>

Correct Your Information?</font></span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt"><br>

Disclosure of Information?<br>
</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt">We may disclose
information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires
it or for the protection of our legal rights.</span> <font size="2"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt">We may also disclose account information when we have reason to believe that
disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our users and the Public.</span></font></font></p>

used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</font></span></p>
