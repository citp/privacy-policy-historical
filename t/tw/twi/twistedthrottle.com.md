 **Using Information We Collect**    
At Twisted Throttle, we always want to provide you with the best possible shopping experience and fulfill your orders exactly as you've requested. In order to do this, we collect information that allows us to:

  * Provide information concerning product recalls or products you have purchased
  * Improve our merchandise selection and customer service



**Information We Share with Others**    
We contract with other companies to provide certain services, including credit card processing, shipping, and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and work closely with them to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. These companies are prohibited by contract from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Twisted Throttle. 

On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes. 

Other than in the specific circumstances listed above, we do not distribute customer information to other companies for any reason. 

 **Your Choices**    
We offer choices about the types of information you receive from us. If you prefer not to receive catalogs or other communications from Twisted Throttle, or prefer to receive them less frequently, please contact us at the address shown above. If you no longer wish to receive our Email Newsletter you also may unsubscribe using the link provided in each edition of the email. 

Please be sure to provide us your exact name and address, or the mailing label from your catalog, so that we can be sure to identify you correctly. Because we plan our mailings in advance, it may take several weeks for your request to become effective. If, due to human error, you continue to receive our communications, please contact us again and we will make every effort to correct the situation.

We also may contract with other companies who use cookies or other online tools to measure the performance of a marketing effort on our behalf. We prohibit these companies from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Twisted Throttle. 

 **How We Use Email**    
When you provide us your email address, we may send you emails necessary to process your order or respond to a request. For example, after you place an order at http://www.twistedthrottle.com/, you will receive an email confirmation and, in most cases, an email with package tracking information. 

We will not send you promotional email (our Email Newsletter) unless you have explicitly requested that we do so. To be immediately removed from our email list, enter your email address in the newsletter subscription box at the bottom of this web page and click "Unsubscribe". 

 **Links to Other Sites**    
Occasionally we provide links on our Web site to other sites we think you will enjoy.

A limited amount of purchase information also may be available to you. To protect your privacy, we will need to validate your identity before you update or review your information. 

 **Security**    
It is our intent to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you. We use a variety of current technologies and processes for protection of our customer data. We limit the information we provide to outside companies with whom we contract to only what they need to carry out their responsibilities. 

When you make a purchase, request a catalog or create an account on our Web site, your transactional information is transmitted in a safe, encrypted format. For additional information, see our Security Information page.
