# Mailstrom: Privacy Policy

## Background

410 Labs, Inc. (d/b/a Mailstrom) understands that your privacy is important to you and that you care about how your information is used and shared online. We respect and value the privacy of everyone who visits our sites or uses our applications (our “Services”) and will only collect and use information in ways that are useful to you and in a manner consistent with your rights and our obligations under the law. 

This Policy applies to our use of any and all data collected by us in relation to your use of our Services. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and ensure that you understand it. Your acceptance of Our Privacy Policy is deemed to occur upon your first use of our Service or you will be required to read and accept this Privacy Policy when signing up for an Account. If you do not accept and agree with this Privacy Policy, you must stop using our Services immediately. 

Our data collection, use and protection policies are described below. 

## Users of Our Website, Applications and Services

Like most operators of web services and applications, Mailstrom collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each user request. Mailstrom's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Mailstrom's users use its website. From time to time, Mailstrom may share or release non-personally-identifying information as described below. 

Mailstrom also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Mailstrom does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than as described below. 

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain users of Mailstrom's Services choose to interact with Mailstrom in ways that require Mailstrom to gather personally-identifying information. Mailstrom may gain access to personally-identifying information due to the user signing-up or using the service via a third party, such as Google. For example, Mailstrom may collect your name, email address and email credentials when you register for the service and may collect, retain and use the email address you use when you make inquiries. 

The amount and type of information that Mailstrom gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Mailstrom collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user's interaction with Mailstrom. Mailstrom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities. 

Mailstrom may share your personally identifying information if the disclosure is done as part of a purchase, transfer or sale of Services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of the company's assets are acquired by another party, customer information may be one of the transferred assets). 

Children's Privacy. This service is not designed nor intended to be attractive to use by children under the age of 13. Mailstrom does not knowingly collect from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 please do not submit any information.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Mailstrom discloses personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Mailstrom's behalf or to provide Services available via Mailstrom. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Mailstrom, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Mailstrom discloses personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Mailstrom believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mailstrom, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Mailstrom and have supplied your email address, Mailstrom may occasionally send you an email to tell you about relevant user activity on Mailstrom, new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Mailstrom. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 

Mailstrom does not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
