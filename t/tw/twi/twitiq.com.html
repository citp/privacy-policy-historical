	<p>
		TwitIQ.com realizes that privacy is an important issue for our users. This document outlines 	
		the type of information that TwitIQ.com ("we," "us," "TwitIQ" or "TwitIQ.com") collects when 
		our users use our services, and the steps that we take to safeguard your information.
	</p>

	<div class="about_title1">Information Collected by TwitIQ.com</div>
	
	<p>
	TwitIQ.com collects various pieces of information on our servers in the United States when you 
	use our services. Some of this information collection happens with your permission and some of 
	it happens implicitly as you use our services.

			<div class="li_sub1">
				When you use our website, we record and maintain a log of requests sent by your 
				browser to our web servers. This information includes information such as the URL that
				was used to view our website, your PC's Internet Protocol address, and the timestamp of 
				the request. 
			</div>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<div class="li_t1">Twitter Web Service APIs</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">
				TwitIQ.com utilizes Twitter's web service APIs to authenticate, access, and update
				your Twitter activities on your behalf. Your Twitter activities conducted through
				Twitter's web service API's are governed by their individual privacy policy,
				not by TwitIQ.com's privacy policy.
			</div>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<div class="li_t1">Third Party Advertisers</div>		
			<div class="li_sub1">
				Advertisements of third-party advertisers may be displayed on TwitIQ.com. If you choose 
				to click on an advertisement or link, TwitIQ.com may provide non-personally 
				identifiable information to the advertiser and/or web publisher. Also, the advertiser 
				or web publisher may use cookies or other technologies to collect information when 
				you are visiting their web sites. The information advertisers or other third parties 
				collect is governed by their individual privacy policies, not by TwitIQ.com's 
				privacy policy.

	<div class="about_title1">How we Store and Use your Information</div>

    <ul>
    	<li>
    		<div class="li_t1">Your Twitter Username and Password</div>
    		<div class="li_sub1">
				We collect your Twitter Username and Password so that it can be sent to
				Twitter's API services to authenticate you as a valid Twitter user.
			</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">	
				Your Twitter Username and Password are stored on TwitIQ.com's servers in encrypted 
				form. We will never disclose your Twitter Password to other users or to third parties. 
			</div>
		</li>

		<li>
			<div class="li_t1">Interest Profiles</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">
				Keywords related to your Twitter activity will become part of an internal interest profile 
				that will be used to generate recommendations throughout the TwitIQ.com website. 
				This profile may also be used to provide other personalized TwitIQ.com services.
			</div>
			<div class="li_sub1"> 
				Keywords in your interest profile derived from activities that are displayed publicly
				in your Twitter updates may be displayed in your public profile. However, keywords
				derived from private Twitter activities will be kept private and never shared publicly
				on the TwitIQ.com website.
			</div>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<div class="li_t1">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">
				TwitIQ.com may use non-personally identifiable information we collect to improve the 
				quality of our services - for example, by diagnosing service or technology problems, 
				by assessing and maintaining security, by increasing ad placements on web pages 
				that are receiving more web traffic and presenting you with ads that we think you 
				would be interested in seeing. We may also use the information to count and recognize 
				returning users. This information will not be made available to third parties for 
				promotional purposes. We will periodically delete this information to minimize the 
				history of your actions on our website.
			</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">
				TwitIQ.com may conduct research on the non-personally identifiable information 
				collected to determine user demographics, interests, and behavior and may market 
				the TwitIQ.com service by sharing non-personally identifiable information with 
				potential advertisers or partners. If it does so, TwitIQ.com will share the non-personally
				identifiable information in such a way that users are not identified. 
				For example, we may provide demographic or usage information to an advertiser so 
				they may see how many registered users are from a specific geographic area or 
				clicked on a certain ad in the previous month. TwitIQ.com also may provide your 
				non-personally identifiable information to contractors so that they can perform 
				services for us.
			</div>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<div class="li_t1">Security</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">
				TwitIQ.com makes significant efforts to protect against the loss, misuse, and 
				alteration of the collected information. These measures may include the use of 
				secure server technology. Be aware, however, that the Internet is not 100% secure. 
				Therefore, we cannot ensure the security of any information transmitted over the 
				Internet, and we accept no liability for any disclosure.

		<li>
			<div class="li_t1">Information Sharing with Third Parties</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">
				TwitIQ.com will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties.

				parties. This information will only be disclosed in aggregate form and will not 
				uniquely identify you to third parties.
			</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">
				TwitIQ.com utilizes PayPal to process PayPal and credit card transactions. 
				When processing PayPal transactions, we re-direct you to the PayPal service which 
				collects and processes your PayPal authentication and credit card information. 
				TwitIQ.com does not retain any PayPal user information or credit card information. 
				Please see PayPal's privacy policy for more information on their privacy practices.

			<div class="li_t1">Other Sharing of Information</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">
				TwitIQ.com may release information when necessary to comply with the law or a 
				court order or an investigation. TwitIQ.com also may release information to 
				law enforcement to protect its rights, property, or other interests, including 
				those of its customers or users or to prevent illegal activities or violations 
				of TwitIQ.com's Terms of Use.
			</div>
			<div class="li_sub1">
				In the event that TwitIQ.com, in whole or in part, establishes a partnership 
				with another company, or is acquired by or merged with another company, 
				collected information may be transferred to the partner or the acquiring
