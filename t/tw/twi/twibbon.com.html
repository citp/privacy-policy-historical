                <p>When you visit this service, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, the location of your ISP and any advertisements on which you click.

                <h3>What we do with the information we gather</h3>
                <p>We require this information for the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In order for you to support a campaign on Facebook or Twitter, or to create a profile on Twibbon.com, or to start a campaign on Twibbon.com.</li>
                    <li>For internal record keeping.</li>
                    <li>To improve our products and services.</li>
                    <li>So we may provide you with quicker support.</li>
                    <li>To send you updates related to Twibbon or any campaign you have created.</li>
                    <li>To send you promotional information about 3rd parties which we think you may find interesting.</li>
                    <li>To send your Facebook or Twitter profile picture that we collect to 3rd parties only in these circumstances:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you support a campaign by updating your profile picture on Twitter or posting an image to your Facebook profile.</li>
                        <li>If the campaign explicitly states that your Facebook or Twitter profile picture will be sent to a 3rd party.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This statement must detail who the 3rd party is.</li>
                            <li>The profile picture can only be limited to use for marketing purposes, and the statement must detail this.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>If the 3rd party is affiliated with the campaign you have supported.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>For special cases where we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our terms and conditions or may be causing injury or interference with our rights, property, our customers or anyone who could be harmed by such activities. We may also disclose information we collect when we believe, in good faith, that the law requires it.</li>
                </ul>
