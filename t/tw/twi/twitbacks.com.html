        <p><strong>Our Commitment To Privacy </strong></p>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we 
          provide this notice explaining our online information practices and 
          the choices you can make about the way your information is collected 
          and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on 
          our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information 
          may be requested. </p>
        <p><strong>The Information We Collect: </strong></p>
        <p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the 
          TwitBacks.com website. On some pages, you can create backgrounds, purchase 
          services and make requests. The types of personal information collected 
          at these pages are: </p>
        <p>Name <br>
          Address <br>
          Email address <br>
          Phone number <br>
          Credit/Debit Card Information <br>
          (etc.) </p>
        <p><strong>The Way We Use Information: </strong></p>
        <p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order 
          only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside 
          parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. </p>
        <p>We use  email addresses to answer the email we receive, to send 
          confirmation emails and newsletters. Such email addresses are not  shared or re-sold to outside parties. Newsletters may contain outside party advertisments but we do not share your email address with these outside parties.</p>
        <p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our 
          website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser 
          that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, 
          or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration 
          form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify 
          those individuals. </p>
        <p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information 
          provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above 
          without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit 
          such unrelated uses. </p>
        <p><strong>Our Commitment To Data Security </strong></p>
        <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure 
          the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, 
          electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information 
          we collect online. </p>
        <p><strong>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy: </strong></p>
        <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For 
          that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website 
          from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website 
          is structured to attract anyone under 13. </p>
        <p><strong>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information </strong></p>
        <p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we 
          collect online through our website or by sending an email to backs@twitbacks.com. 
        </p>
        <p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information 
          by sending us a request that credibly shows error. </p>
        <p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable 
          steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>How To Contact Us</strong> </p>
        <p>Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, 
          please send us an email at backs@twitbacks.com<br>
