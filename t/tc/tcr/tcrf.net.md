# The Cutting Room Floor:Privacy policy - The Cutting Room Floor

~~Blah blah blah someone copy paste a boilerplate privacy policy here because nobody really cares.~~

 ~~All data is used and abused for logging, statistics, and other data. However, we won't sell it unless someone offers us many many _ **many**_ dollars.~~

  
The Cutting Room Floor has no formal privacy policy, because those are a lot of legalese and we don't really have money for that. Instead, have some basics: 

  * We don't sell any of your information.
  * The only information we collect when you visit here is your IP address (kind of required for the internet to work).
  * If you register, we collect some further (optional) information: 
    * Your email address. This is only used to send you opted-in system emails (e.g. watch lists, change notices) or for password resets, and is never given out or sold.
    * Your "real name". MediaWiki probably displays this information somewhere. Nothing stops you from entering a fake one, and we don't sell it or give it out.
    * Your username. You can enter anything for this as well, used for logging in and probably crediting people.



We use (non-Google) analytics software to track access. That software collects different things, which are not cross-referenced with the above. Aggregated versions of these statistics may be released, but never sold: 

  * Your IP address.
  * Various browser details, such as user agent, resolution, etc.
  * The page that referred you, if any.
  * Your visits to this site and pages accessed.



We use an advertising service. They are not based on "relevance". You can read more in the [Project Wonderful privacy policy](https://www.projectwonderful.com/privacypolicy.php), which is fancy and official and not ours.
