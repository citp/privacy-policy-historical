**1\. INFORMATION COLLECTION**

Customers are not required to set up an account or provide any method of payment. Customers are asked to provide personal information including a name, telephone number, e-mail address, mailing or product delivery address, date of purchase, name of retailer, product model number, and product serial number. We may ask for similar information when you enter into a sweepstakes, giveaway, or other promotion; when you request customer support; or, when you otherwise communicate with us.

We (or our marketing partner, warranty service provider(s), or other business partners or affiliates) may collect information about you, including personal information **,** such as name, e-mail address, telephone number, mailing or product delivery address, date of birth (for the purpose of verifying age in sweepstakes or giveaways (or to ensure you are older than thirteen (13) years of age), gender, and certain other demographic information.
