## Responsibilities of Online Banking Customers

There are some things we cannot prevent, and therefore will not be responsible for the reimbursement of damages or losses caused by:

  * Customer input errors.
  * Customer's negligence by sharing or handling of personal ID's and passwords, which result in unauthorized access to accounts. Customer passwords must be kept secret. This includes loss of IDs and passwords resulting from computer viruses or software that allows others to obtain private information from your computer (e.g., key logging software etc.).
  * Customer's neglect to report thefts of passwords or ID's.
  * Customer's failure to complete banking sessions by clicking the EXIT button before leaving the computer unattended. Security Tip: When you begin a session of online banking, your User ID and password are stored on our computer from the moment you log on to the moment you click EXIT. If the PC is left unattended with the browser still running and your online banking session still active, anyone can gain access to your accounts from that PC! Be sure to completely end the session before leaving your computer.
  * Known incidents of theft or loss of debit cards not reported to one of our Representatives either by phone, e-mail, or in person, within 2 business days. Remember...Our 24-Hour Customer Service Center is available to you 365 days a year at 1-800-922-8742. Security Tip: Be sure to keep your computer free from viruses that could be used to capture password keystrokes!



We take pride in the service we deliver to our customers and believe that you will find Tri Counties Bank is attentive to any concerns that you may have about conducting online banking transactions. However, if you have any thoughts or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us at 1-800-922-8742.
