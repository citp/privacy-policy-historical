		your personal information to third-party businesses, 
		except as described below. You provide important information 
		about yourself to a variety of businesses and organizations. 
		As our customer you also provide us with important 
		information about yourself. This information helps 
		us give you better service, offer you better products, 
		and complete your transactions more effectively.</i> 
	  </p><p><i>We are proud to make that commitment to you because

		that you read it carefully.</i> 
	  </p><p><font color="#000080"><b>NOTICE 
		OF YOUR FINANCIAL PRIVACY RIGHTS </b></font> 
	  </p><p>We first define some terms. 
	  </p><p><b>We</b>, <b>our</b>, and <b>us</b>, when used in 
		this notice, mean Tri Counties Bank and all other 
		members of the TCB family of companies. 
	  </p><p>This is our privacy notice for our customers. When 
		we use the words "you" and "your" 
		we mean our consumer customers who have a continuing 
		relationship with us by purchasing or holding financial 
		products or services such as a 
	  </p><ul>
		<li>Deposit Account</li>
		<li>Loan account</li>
		<li>Safe Deposit box</li>
		<li>Retail installment contract we service</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>We will tell you the sources of the information we 
		collect about you. We will tell you what measures 
		we take to secure that information.
	  </p><p><i><b>Nonpublic personal information</b></i> means 
		information about you that we collect in connection 
		with providing a financial product or service to you. 
		Nonpublic personal information does not usually include 
		information that is available from public sources, 
		such as telephone directories or government records. 
		In this Notice, we will use the term "information" 
		to mean non-public personal information as defined 
		in this section.
	  </p><p>An <i><b>affiliate</b></i> is a member of our corporate 
		family. 
	  </p><p>A <i><b>nonaffiliated third party</b></i> is a person 
		we do not employ or a company that is not an affiliate 
		of ours. This is also known as nonaffiliated third 
		party, or simply, an "other party." Please 
		note that nonaffiliated third parties may have access 
		to information about you that has been obtained independently, 
		such as through credit bureaus or public records.
	  </p><p><b><font color="#000080">COLLECTING INFORMATION TO 
		CONDUCT YOUR BUSINESS</font></b>
	  </p><p>We collect information about you from the following 
		sources:
	  </p><ul>
		<li>Information you give us on applications or other 
		  forms</li>
		<li> Information about your transactions with us</li>
		<li> Information about your transactions with our 
		  affiliates</li>
		<li> Information about your transactions with other 
		  parties</li>
		<li> Information from a consumer reporting agency</li>
		<li> Information we receive through our Customer Identification Program</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> <b><font color="#000080">SECURITY PRACTICES TO PROTECT 
		YOUR INFORMATION</font></b> 
	  </p><p>We restrict access to information about you to those 
		employees who need to know that information in order 
		to provide products or services to you. Employees 
		who have access to your information are required to 
		protect and keep it confidential. Additionally, we 
		use technology designed to keep your information and 
		transactions private and secure, including when you 
		use our Internet Banking service for your on-line 
		banking and bill payment transactions. 
	  </p><p><b><font color="#000080">HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL 
		INFORMATION</font></b>
	  </p><p>We will not share information about you to anyone 
		outside of our corporate family except as disclosed 
		in this policy or as permitted by law. For example, 
		customer information on loan applications helps us 
		make loans that meet federal banking regulations. 
		Information on your signature card enables us to order 
		your checks from a check printer when you request 
		them. Your information can help protect your accounts 
		from fraud, help resolve customer disputes, or protect 
		property you have pledged as collateral for a loan.
	  </p><p>We may also share all of your information that we 
		collect with companies that perform marketing services 
		on our behalf, and to certain of our own employees, 
		who are also authorized representatives of other financial 
		service providers, such as Raymond James Financial 
		Services with whom we have carefully structured arrangements. 
		These companies work jointly with us to provide a 
		service or product we are unable to provide for you 
		solely within our own company. We are allowed to do 
		this only if they have entered into a joint marketing 
		contract with us, which prohibits the sharing of your 
		information for their own unrelated marketing purposes. 
		Examples of such products and services include alternative 
		investment products, such as mutual funds or annuities, 
		or life and casualty insurance products that protect 
		life and property. In these instances, employees have 
		access to information such as your name, address, 
		social security number, assets, income, telephone 
		number, and your transaction activity with us, such 
		as account balances, payment and deposit history. 
		We will utilize only the information that we deem 
		appropriate to offer you these special products and 
		services. You can't opt out of this kind of information 
		sharing.
	  </p><p><b><font color="#000080">COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT 
		FORMER CUSTOMERS</font></b>
	  </p><p>We do not disclose information about former customers, 
		except as permitted or required by law.</p>
	  <p><b><font color="#000080">CHANGING OUR PRIVACY POLICY 
		IN THE FUTURE</font></b>
	  </p><p>We reserve the right to amend or change our policy 
		at any time, but if we do this, we will mail a new 
		policy to our current customers at least 30 days prior 
		to implementing the change, allowing you time to review 
		and act on the new changes.

	  yourself so that we can respond to an inquiry or request 
	  from you, we collect and store only the following information: 
	</p><ul>

		purposes.&nbsp;</li>
		
	  <li>We maintain your personally identifying information 
		using a secure encryption program called Secure Socket

	  or losses caused by: 
	</p><ul>
		  <li> 
			
		<p>Customer input errors. 
	  </p></li><li> 
			
		<p>Customer's negligence by sharing or handling of

		  access to accounts. <strong>Customer passwords must 
		  be kept secret</strong>. 
	  </p></li><li> 
			
		<p>Customer's neglect to report thefts of passwords
