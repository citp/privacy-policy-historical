            <h3>Privacy Policy for www.tcodesearch.com </h3>

            <p><strong> Privacy of our visitors to www.tcodesearch.com is important to us. </strong></p>

            <p> At www.tcodesearch.com, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is
                information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use and visit
                www.tcodesearch.com, and how we safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to
                third parties.</p>

            <p><strong> Log Files </strong></p>

            <p> As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the
                log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL
                or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time
                you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.

            </p><p><strong> Cookies and Web Beacons </strong></p>

            <p> We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This
                could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our
                features, such as forums.</p>

            <p> We also use third party advertisements on www.tcodesearch.com to support our site. Some of these
                advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which
                will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information
                including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether
                you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate
                ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as
                showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). To learn more about this behavioral
                advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit
                www.networkadvertising.org </p>

            <p> You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser
                settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can
                affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the
                inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts. </p>
