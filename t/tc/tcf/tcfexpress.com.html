          <td>The TCF financial service providers - TCF BANK and its affiliated 
            companies - understand that you expect your non-public personal financial 
            information to be kept private and secure. We respect your concern 
            about privacy, and we know you place your trust in us. TCF has been 
            a trusted name for over 75 years, and we are committed to continuing 
            this tradition and to earning your trust every day. 
            <p><strong>The TCF Privacy Policy</strong></p>
            <p>Please take a few moments to read about how we protect, collect, 
              and use your non-public personal information and how we may share 
              the information. This policy applies only to information obtained 
              in connection with products or services primarily for personal, 
              family, or household purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>What Information We Collect When You Visit Our Website</strong></p>
            <p><strong>When you browse:</strong> When you visit the TCF website 
              and browse, we do not collect any information about you. We do record 
              the date and time of visits to our website and the pages visited 
              while at our site. We do this to determine which pages are visited 
              most often, so we can enhance our website to make it more useful 
              to our customers.</p>
            <p><strong>When you want information or perform online transactions:</strong> 
              When you visit the TCF website and request information or want banking 
              transactions, we collect the information we believe is necessary 
              to safely process the transaction. For example, for TCF Totally 
              Free Online, you will be asked to enter your secret code and account 
              number. For TCF Preferred Online you will be asked to enter your 
              user I.D. and password. Our Internet Security policy more fully 
              describes the information we collect to identify you for Internet 
              banking transactions. We need to identify you to prevent access 
              to your information by unauthorized persons. When you request information 
              or want banking transactions, we may also collect information to 
              help us understand your financial needs in order to offer you helpful 
              products and services. For example, if we know that you own a home, 
              we may offer you a home equity loan. We do this by collecting identifying 
              information (such as your name and address), information from your 
              application (such as your assets), transaction information with 
              us (such as your loan repayment history) and information to comply 
              with applicable laws and regulations. Federal law requires us to 
              collect a tax identification number, such as a social security number, 
              for accounts, which pay interest. We may also collect information 
              to design new products or services, or modify existing products 
              or services, in order to meet the needs of our customers.</p>
            <p><strong>How TCF Collects Customer Information</strong></p>
            <p>You will enter data that is collected by TCF. In addition to the 
              information you provide, we may collect information from consumer 
              reporting agencies or your transaction history with us. In addition, 
              we record certain information about you based on what you do in 
              our website. For example, we will record the date and time you visited 
              and the pages you visited. We use this information to compile research 
              to better serve our customers.</p>
            <p><strong>Use of "Cookie" Technologies</strong></p>
            <p>Some websites including TCF, place permanent cookies, or permanent 
              electronic files, on your hard drive; the cookies collect data. 
              We occasionally use permanent cookies and place a permanent electronic 
              file on your computer. This means you may not have to re-enter your 
              personal identification information each time you want to bank over 
              the Internet with us.</p>
            <p>We also use temporary cookies, which are automatically deleted 
              at the end of a session or expire within 24 hours. These cookies 
              improve the quality of your browsing experience by performing technical 
              tasks such as web server performance, security and enabling you 
              to enter your personal identifying information less frequently during 
              a banking session with us.</p>
            <p>If your browser lets you, you may decline our cookies, but if you 
              do you may not be able to access all the features of our website 
              including online banking and bill payment and you will have to enter 
              your personal identifying information more frequently during a session.</p>
            <p><strong>How We Use the Information We Collect</strong></p>
            <p>We collect identifying information (such as your password or secret 
              code) in online banking transactions to help us confirm you are 
              the owner of the account. If you do not provide the information 
              we ask for, you will not be able to use our online banking services.</p>
            <p>We may also use the information we collect about you to offer you 
              products and services. See "Sharing Your Information" 
              below.</p>
            <p><strong>Accuracy of Customer Information</strong></p>
            <p>TCF has established audit procedures to maintain the accuracy and 
              integrity of account and personal information. If you believe the 
              account or personal information we maintain is incorrect, or if 
              you would like to review your account or personal information, please 
              <a href="../ContactUs/index.jsp">contact us</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>We use industry standards to safeguard your personal identifying 
              information, such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol and firewalls. 
              These systems are designed to guard against unauthorized access 
              and use of customer information by unauthorized individuals. We 
              work to upgrade these features on an ongoing basis. See <a href="../Security/index.jsp">Internet 
              Security</a> for additional information regarding the steps we have 
              taken to ensure your online banking transactions are secure.</p>
            <p><strong>Links To Other Web Sites</strong></p>
            <p>Clicking on certain links within this website will take you to 
              other websites or material not under the control of TCF. The operators 
              of those other websites, and not TCF, control those sites and determine 
              what use will be made of information collected from users.</p>
            <p><strong>What Information We Collect About You</strong></p>
            <p>First and foremost, we collect non-public personal information 
              about you in order to establish and service your account. We also 
              collect this information so that we in the TCF companies may provide 
              you the highest level of service. We collect non-public personal 
              information about you from the following three general sources:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms. 
                  For example, this includes identification and contact information, 
                  income, assets, and references;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Information about your transactions with us, our TCF affiliated 
                  companies, or others. For example, this includes your balances 
                  and loan payment history; and</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency. For 
                  example, this includes your credit history.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Sharing Your Information</strong></p>
            <p>We may share all of the non-public personal information that we 
              collect about you, as described in this policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Sharing Your Information with TCF Companies</strong></p>
            <p>We share all the non-public personal information we collect about 
              you, as described above, with our TCF affiliated companies for a 
              number of reasons, such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>To protect you. The information we maintain about your customer 
                  relationship helps us identify you.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>To provide service. Your information allows us to respond to 
                  your requests.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>To tell you about new financial services. You may receive coupons, 
                  special offers and incentives based on your account history 
                  and information we have about you. For example, if we know that 
                  you own your own home, we might offer you a home equity loan.</p>
              </li>

            <p>A consumer report is any written, oral, or other communication 
              from a consumer reporting agency which bears on a consumer's credit 
              worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general 
              reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is 
              used or expected to be used in whole or in part for the purpose 
              of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility 
              for: (a) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, 
              family, or household purposes; (b) employment purposes; or (c) any 
              other purpose authorized under section 604 of the Fair Credit Reporting 
              Act.</p>

            <p><strong>Sharing Customer Information for Service and Joint Marketing 
              Reasons, and When Permitted or Required by Federal or State Law</strong></p>
            <p>We may also share non-public personal information about you with 
              third parties who are not part of the TCF affiliated companies for 
              service and joint marketing reasons and when allowed by law.</p>
            <p><strong>Sharing Your Information With Service Providers</strong></p>
            <p>We may hire companies to provide materials or to perform some services 
              for us. For example, we hire non-TCF companies to print checks for 
              your checking account. To enable these service providers to perform 
              the services for which we hire them, we need to give them some or 
              all of the information described in the "What Information We Collect 
              About You" section above. Our service providers are not permitted 
              to use any information we share with them about you for any purpose 
              except to perform those services.</p>
            <p><strong>Sharing Your Information for Joint Marketing</strong></p>
            <p>We may enter into agreements with other financial institutions 
              (for example, banks, investment firms, and insurance companies, 
              mortgage companies, brokerage houses) to jointly market products 
              or services between us. In order to offer these products or services 
              to you, we may share all of the information we collect, as described 
              under "What Information We Collect About You" above, with companies 
              that perform these marketing services on our behalf or to other 
              financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.</p>
            <p><strong>Sharing Your Information When Permitted or Required by 
              Federal or State Law</strong></p>
            <p>We may share your information with other parties when permitted 
              or required by federal or state law. For example, we share information 
              in order to protect against fraud, report transactions to consumer 
              reporting agencies, respond to subpoenas, and when you ask us to.</p>
            <p>We may always share your information as described in this section 
              for Service and Joint Marketing Reasons, and When Permitted or Required 
              by Federal or State Law, even if you ask us not to (even if you 
              opt-out).</p>
            <p><strong>Sharing Information About Former Customers</strong></p>
            <p>When a TCF account has been closed, information about the account 
              remains in our files. Although we use non-public personal information 
              about former customers less and less over time, the same policies 
              about sharing described above apply to former customers' non-public 
              personal information, and we take exactly the same care in how we 
              collect, use, and protect information about former customers as 
              we do about current customers.</p>
            <p><strong>Employee Access to Customer Information</strong></p>
            <p>We restrict access to non-public personal information about you 
              to those employees who need to know that information to perform 
              their job at TCF. Our employees are trained to respect customer 
              privacy and to access customer information only when they have a 
              business reason to know the information. Our employees are subject 
              to discipline for violating our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong></p>
            <p>TCF maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that 
              comply with federal regulations to guard your non-public personal

            <p>If you prefer that we not share non-public personal information 
              about you with third parties who are not affiliated with TCF, you 
              may opt out of the sharing. That is, you may direct us not to share 
              the information. If you wish to opt-out of sharing information with 
              third parties who are not affiliated with TCF, <a href="footer_privacy_optout.jsp">contact

                <p>We will also continue to share, within the TCF companies, information 
                  about our experiences or transactions with you. In addition, 
                  we will share your information with other TCF companies when 
                  you ask us to. This opt-out does not affect our right to share

                  about you described under "What Information We Collect 
                  About You" above.</p>
                <p>However, we will continue to share non-public personal information

                  and Joint Marketing Reasons and When Permitted or Required by
