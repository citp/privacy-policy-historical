# TCS' Privacy Policy

_Introduction_

Your privacy is important to us. We believe it is important for you to know what personal data we, **Tata Consultancy Services** (“TCS” or “we”), collect from you (and third parties), why we collect it, how we use it and what rights you might be entitled to as a data subject.

When we collect and use personal data about you we may be subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) and responsible as a ‘data controller’ of such personal data.

We are required under data protection legislation to notify you of the information contained in this privacy notice. It is important that you read this notice, together with any additional and more specific information we may provide to you on various occasions when we are collecting or processing personal data on certain specific websites, products or applications, events and initiatives so that you are aware of how and why we are using such information. (We issue a different privacy statement which applies where there is an employment relationship between TCS and its employees.)

_How we will use your personal information_

We may collect different kinds of personal information in a number of different ways and use it for a number of different purposes:

  * **To ensure access to our website and online services.  
**In general, you can visit TCS on the World Wide Web without telling us who you are. Our web servers or Affiliates who provide analytics and performance enhancement services may collect:

    * IP addresses,

    * operating system details,

    * browsing details,

    * device and connectivity details, and/or
