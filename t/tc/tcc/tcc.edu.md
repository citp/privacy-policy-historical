Policies and Procedures                                                          June 4, 2010

1. Purpose
    This policy sets forth Tidewater Community College’s position regarding the
    protection of individual privacy and the confidentiality of personally identifiable
    information provided by its employees, students, and visitors, whether that
    information is provided in an electronic or physical form.
    The Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act (Code of Virginia
    § 2.2-3800 et seq.) requires that “Any agency holding personal information shall
    assure its reliability and take precautions to prevent its misuse.” This provision does
    not distinguish between information maintained in electronic or physical form—i.e.,
    digital/computer-stored or paper records. Other state and federal laws and
    regulations govern specific types of personal information.
2. Policy
    Tidewater Community College is committed to protecting individual privacy and to
    ensuring the confidentiality of personally identifiable information provided by its
    employees, students, and visitors. To that end, TCC has developed and
    promulgated the Information Privacy Statement appearing in Appendix A. This
    statement shall be published on the college’s website and in its student and
    employee handbooks. A companion Internet Privacy Statement appearing in
    Appendix B shall be published on the college’s website with a link to it from each
    page on TCC’s website.
    2.1. Personal Information
          For agencies and institutions of the Commonwealth, “Personal Information” (PI)
          is defined in the Code of Virginia § 2.2-3801 (see the definition on page 15). As
          a practical matter, TCC considers PI to be any name or number that may be
          used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific
          individual, including any:
            1. Names and Numbers:
                a. Name (when combined with other elements of PI)
                b. Postal or electronic mail address
Privacy                                                                           Page 2 of 16

Policies and Procedures                                                              June 4, 2010
                 c.  Telephone number
                 d.  Date and year of birth
                 e.  Social Security number
                 f.  Mother's maiden name
                 g.  Official state-issued or US-issued driver's license or identification
                     number
                 h. Alien registration number
                 i. Government passport number
                 j. Employer or taxpayer identification number
                 k. Medicaid or food stamp account number
                 l. Bank account number
                 m. Credit or debit card number
                 n. Personal identification number or code assigned to the holder of a
                     debit card by the issuer to permit authorized electronic use of such
                     card;
            2.   Unique biometric data, such as fingerprint, voiceprint, retina or iris image,
                 or other unique physical representation;
            3.   Unique electronic identification number, address, or routing code;
            4.   Medical records;
            5.   Academic grades;
            6.   Telecommunication identifying information or access device;
            7.   Other number or information that can be used to access a person's
                 financial resources.
          It is TCC’s policy and practice to collect the least amount of PI necessary to
          fulfill its required duties and responsibilities, to complete a particular
          transaction, to deliver services, or as required by law. This applies to the
          collection of all PI regardless of source or medium.
          Information provided by a data subject shall be shared only with members of
          the TCC community who have a need to know in order to provide services or
          conduct college business. TCC may share PI with other individuals or
          organizations that provide services to the college only as necessary to provide
          the services. TCC requires these third parties to protect PI it receives pursuant
          to this policy and applicable law. The college will take reasonable and
          appropriate measures to protect PI from unauthorized access or disclosure.
          As a public institution, some PI maintained by TCC may be subject to
          disclosure pursuant to The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (Code of
          Virginia § 2.2-3700 et seq.). In addition, TCC may disclose information to third
          parties when such disclosure is required or permitted by law.
Privacy                                                                              Page 3 of 16


Tidewater Community College                                                 No. 1104    Rev: 0
Policies and Procedures                                                           June 4, 2010
          Additionally, as stipulated in the Code of Virginia § 2.2-3801, “…routine
          information maintained for the purpose of internal office administration whose
          use could not be such as to affect adversely any data subject” is not considered
          PI. For example, an office phone tree used for contacting staff in the event of
          an emergency, would not be considered PI under the law or this policy.
    2.2. Compliance with Relevant Laws
          TCC will comply with the relevant provisions of the various state and federal
          statutes governing privacy in the workplace and for students, to the extent that
          they apply to the college’s operations, including but not limited to:
            1. Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act (Code of
               Virginia § 2.2-3800 et seq.)
            2. The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (Code of Virginia § 2.2-3700 et
               seq.)
            3. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g;
               34 CFR Part 99)
            4. Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) (15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.).
            5. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACT Act) (16 C.F.R. Part
               681.
            6. Financial Services Modernization Act (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) (15
               U.S.C. § 6801 et seq.)
            7. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (Public Law
               104-191)
    2.3. College Privacy Officer
          The College Privacy Officer shall be appointed by the College President to
          oversee all TCC activities related to the development, implementation,
          maintenance of, and adherence to the college’s policies and procedures
          covering the privacy of, and access to, personal information in compliance with
          federal and state laws. The College Privacy Officer shall have the
          responsibilities delineated in Appendix C.
    2.4. Privacy Oversight Committee
          The members of the Privacy Oversight Committee shall be appointed by the
          College President to assist the College Privacy Officer in evaluating the
          college’s policies and procedures covering the privacy of, and access to,
          personal information. The committee will include representation from the
          President’s Executive Staff, in addition to departments and individuals who can
          lend a college-wide perspective to privacy implementation and compliance. The
          College Privacy Officer will serve as chair of the Privacy Oversight Committee.
Privacy                                                                            Page 4 of 16

Policies and Procedures                                                            June 4, 2010
    2.5. Investigating and Responding to Privacy Violations
          Tidewater Community College will investigate and attempt to resolve all
          complaints and confirmed incidents relating to breaches of privacy and
          confidentiality within a reasonable time after a complaint is received or a
          privacy incident is reported.
          No member of the college community will intimidate, threaten, coerce,
          discriminate against, or take any other form of retaliatory action against any
          person filing a complaint or reporting a privacy incident, or inquiring about how
          to file a complaint or incident report.
          Appropriate sanctions will be applied against members of the college
          community who fail to comply with the college’s privacy and security policies
          and procedures or with federal and state privacy and security regulations.
          The College Privacy Officer will serve as the college’s central contact and
          investigation authority for privacy complaints, incidents, and breaches, including
          coordinating privacy notifications when required. To that end, the College
          Privacy Officer will:
            1. establish and administer a process for receiving, documenting, tracking,
                 investigating, and taking action on complaints concerning TCC’s privacy
                 policies and procedures;
            2. review and determine action on privacy complaints and incident reports
                 filed with the college;
            3. ensure consistent application of sanctions for failure to comply with
                 privacy policies by members of the college community;
            4. document all privacy complaints and reported privacy incidents, including:
                 a. the findings from reviewing each complaint and incident;
                 b. a description of corrective actions taken, or an explanation of why
                     corrective actions are not needed;
                 c. a description of risk assessments completed;
                 d. any notification procedures taken, including recommendations and final
                     approvals; and
                 e. any mitigation undertaken for each specific complaint or incident.
            5. retain documentation for all privacy complaints and incidents for at least
                 six years, or longer if required by law or other circumstances.
          TCC will make reasonable efforts to notify affected persons if it is determined
          that their personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been,
          acquired by an unauthorized person and that the information could be used for
          fraudulent purposes. Notification to affected individuals will include the following
          components:
            1. a general description of the incident;
            2. the police report number, if available;
Privacy                                                                             Page 5 of 16


Tidewater Community College                                                No. 1104    Rev: 0
Policies and Procedures                                                          June 4, 2010
            3. instructions and necessary information for notifying the major credit
                agencies of suspected or potential identity theft; and
            4. the College Privacy Officer’s contact information, including telephone
                number, e-mail address, and postal mailing address.
          If appropriate based on the scope of the violation, the notification will also be
          posted on the TCC website.
3. Responsibilities
    The College Privacy Officer shall develop and promulgate procedures to implement
    the policy delineated above.
4. Procedures
    The following procedures implement TCC’s Privacy Policy. They apply to all college
    records, including computer-based and paper, that contain Personal Information
    (PI).
    Tidewater Community College is committed to protecting the Personal Information of
    its students, employees, alumni, and any others whose PI it collects and stores. In
    the event of a compromise of PI, the college will take appropriate action to notify all
    individuals whose information was subject to the compromise. Should such
    compromise of PI occur as a result of individual misconduct or failure to implement
    necessary security measures, appropriate sanctions will be imposed on the
    responsible individual(s).
    4.1. Protecting Personal Information
          Various state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection and
          safeguarding of Personal Information (PI) and require those who collect PI to
          follow strict guidelines. Protecting such sensitive information is especially
          important because of the potentially severe consequences of identity theft for
          the individual whose PI is compromised.
          All TCC departments must reduce reliance on Social Security numbers (SSNs),
          using alternative forms of identifying students, potential students, employees,
          donors, and alumni whenever possible. Further, all college departments should
          follow good practices in safeguarding all PI. Every TCC employee who has
          access to PI—either intentional or inadvertent—must work to help the college
          meet the requirements imposed by the relevant laws and regulations that
          govern the protection of PI. To that end, Appendix D, “Guidelines for Protecting
          PI,” will be made available on the college’s website and in those work areas in
          which PI is routinely collected, stored, or used in college business practices.
          PI will not be collected, stored, or used except as required by law, or needed to
          perform core college business activities that cannot be immediately facilitated
          by other means. The respective college vice president shall determine whether
Privacy                                                                           Page 6 of 16


Tidewater Community College                                                 No. 1104    Rev: 0
Policies and Procedures                                                           June 4, 2010
          such collection, storage, or use is required to conduct the college’s business as
          follows:
            •   Vice President for Academic & Student Affairs – student and alumni
                records (including the centrally managed Student Information System,
                other than its financial modules)
            •   Vice President for Administration – personnel records
            •   Vice President for Finance – financial records (including those containing
                PI in the Administrative Information System and in the financial modules of
                the Student Information System)
            •   Vice President for Information Systems – infrastructure systems (e.g., the
                college e-mail system and the voice-mail system)
          To the extent feasible, PI will be collected, stored, and processed only via
          centrally managed systems (e.g., the Student Information System). The
          following measures shall be followed to protect PI from compromise.
            1. No college employee will download PI from a centrally managed
                information system or otherwise create a data file—including an ad hoc
                report or query from a centrally managed system such as the Student
                Information System—that contains PI without specific authorization from
                the appropriate vice president as identified above—Appendix E provides a
                process to review requests to establish such local data files, including the
                concurrence of the College Information Security Officer.
            2. PI will not be stored on college-owned local computing systems except as
                specifically authorized by the college vice president as delineated above.
                (PI will not be stored on a personally-owned computing system.) When PI
                is authorized for local storage and processing, the data file(s) will be
                stored in a designated directory on a network server that is backed up
                routinely.
            3. Except as required to provide information to other government agencies or
                authorized third-party partners in support of college business, data files
                containing PI will not be transferred to computing systems that are not
                under the college’s control. Data files containing PI will not be transferred
                or downloaded to an employee’s personal computing system.
            4. Data files containing PI will not be stored on any portable computing
                system (e.g., laptop computer, etc.), whether college-owned or not.
            5. Data files containing PI may be transferred or downloaded to portable
                storage media (e.g., disk, CD/DVD, or USB drive) only with the specific
                authorization of the appropriate college vice president identified above
                and the Vice President for Information Systems. The college employee in
                whose custody such portable storage system is entrusted shall be
                responsible for protecting that data from compromise.

            6. Data files containing PI considered sensitive data shall not be transferred
                or downloaded to portable storage media except with the authorization of
                the College President on the advice of the responsible college vice
                president identified above and the Vice President for Information Systems.
                The approval must document the business reasons for accepting the risks
                to the data and a description of the mitigating controls in place. All data
                storage media containing sensitive data must be both physically and
                logically secured by means approved by the Vice President for Information
                Systems. The college employee in whose custody such portable storage
                system is entrusted shall be responsible for protecting that data from
                compromise. Appendix F provides the format for requesting authorization
                to store sensitive PI data on portable storage media and approval thereof.
            7. Authorized data files that contain PI and that need to be shared with other
                employees in the conduct of their assigned job responsibilities will be
                stored in a “shared directory” such that access is controlled through the
                college’s centrally managed network security procedures.
            8. Data containing PI will not be posted to either the college’s Internet or
                Intranet websites as neither provides sufficient security to protect such
                information from compromise.
          Department heads and responsible departmental personnel must continually
          assess the vulnerabilities of their electronic as well as paper-based systems.
          Annually, in July, each department with responsibility for collecting, processing,
          or storing PI will assess the safeguards in place to protect that sensitive data. A
          report of this assessment will be submitted to the respective supervising
          member of the President’s Executive Staff who will review and submit the
          report to the College Privacy Officer by August 1st of each year. Specific
          safeguarding practices that departments must assess, and if necessary,
          implement, and include in employee training, include:
            1. Maintaining physical security by locking rooms and file cabinets where PI
                is stored or electronic storage is housed. Procedures should include
                ensuring that windows and doors are locked when areas are unoccupied
                and restricting access to areas where sensitive data exists.
            2. Maintaining adequate key control and limiting access to sensitive areas to
                those individuals who require access to the area to carry out their
                assigned job duties.
            3. Using authentication processes (such as secure passwords) and granting
                access privileges only to authorized personnel with legitimate business
                need to authorize and enforce a user’s access to and actions towards
                specified resources.
            4. Using firewalls and encrypting information when feasible.
            5. Referring calls and mail requesting PI to those individuals who have been
                trained in safeguarding information.

Policies and Procedures                                                          June 4, 2010
            6. Shredding paper documents containing PI or deleting such information
                from electronic media, such as a computer hard drive, when no longer
                needed.
            7. Encouraging employees to report suspicious activity to supervisors.
            8. Ensuring that agreements with third-party contractors who have access to
                PI collected by the college contain safeguarding provisions and monitoring
                those agreements to oversee compliance with appropriate privacy and
                safeguarding measures.
            9. Ensuring that electronic hardware, electronic operating systems, software
                upgrades and other electronic means of storing and manipulating data are
                installed and configured to maintain adequate security of PI.
    4.2. Compromise of Personal Information
          Whether the Personal Information is maintained in a paper- or computer-based
          storage system, it will be considered to have been compromised when the
          security of the system in which it resides is breached. A paper-based
          information storage system may be considered to have been compromised
          when a person not authorized to have access to the sensitive data contained in
          the system gains such access. A computer security breach is any incident in
          which the security of a computer system is compromised, including theft or loss
          of a computer or storage device or medium where unauthorized person(s)
          might have been able to access, copy, or read data files on it. It does not
          include normal business use by authorized employees or third-party business
          partners of the college authorized to receive and process PI collected by the
          college. See “Breach [Computer System] on page 14 for the legal definition
          from the Code of Virginia § 18.2-186.6.
          Compromise of Personal Information falls into three categories: incidental,
          accidental, and intentional.
           4.2.1. Incidental Disclosures
                  Incidental Disclosures are unintended revelations of Personal
                  Information that occur during an otherwise permitted use or disclosure of
                  the information. For example, an employee steps into the supervisor’s
                  office and begins discussing a personal matter before the supervisor can
                  shut the office door, and another employee waiting to meet with the
                  supervisor inadvertently overhears a portion of the discussion.
                  An Incidental Disclosures is usually not reportable as a Privacy Incident,
                  and an authorized holder of PI who takes reasonable precautions to
                  preclude its disclosure will not be held liable. However, professional
                  judgment should be used to assess the potential outcome(s) of an
                  Incidental Disclosure. Any disclosure that may result in fraudulent or
                  criminal misuse of the information or have a negative impact on TCC will
                  be reported immediately to the College Privacy Officer.

Policies and Procedures                                                             June 4, 2010
          4.2.2. Accidental Disclosures
                 Accidental Disclosures are unintended exposures of Personal
                 Information despite proper procedures having been followed. For
                 example, a vehicle transporting documents containing Personal
                 Information is involved in an accident resulting in a box containing some
                 of the documents being dislodged and falling open with some pages
                 being blown away. Accidental disclosures are Privacy Incidents and
                 must be reported immediately to the College Privacy Officer.
          4.2.3. Intentional Disclosures
                 Intentional Disclosures are disclosures of Personal Information that
                 occur due to disregard of established policies and procedures, with or
                 without malicious intent. For example, disclosing Personal Information to
                 another individual without confirming that person’s identity or authority to
                 have access to the information disclosed.
                 Any member of the TCC community who becomes aware of an
                 Intentional Disclosure of Personal Information is obligated to report the
                 incident immediately to the College Privacy Officer. Intentional
                 Disclosures are Privacy Incidents and will result in counseling or
                 disciplinary action. Distinct from any sanction imposed by the college, an
                 Intentional Disclosure may also result in personal liability, either in civil or
                 criminal legal action.
    4.3. Reporting Policy Violations
          4.3.1. Reporting Compromise of Personal Information
                 Any member of the college community who becomes aware of an
                 unauthorized disclosure or acquisition of Personal Information or
                 suspects that such an incident has occurred should first take steps to
                 correct the situation. For example, recover a document left in a public
                 place; shut down the affected computer, server, or network; or lock the
                 door to an area where Personal Information has been left exposed.
                 Following the immediate action to protect the Personal Information, the
                 person who has become aware of the situation should complete and
                 submit a Privacy Incident Report form (Appendix G) as soon as
                 practicable, but no later than the end of the person’s work- or class-day.
                 The report will be submitted to the College Privacy Officer and to the
                 respective college vice president with cognizance over the type of
                 information involved in the incident. If the incident involves a computer or
                 other college information technology resource, the report will also be
                 submitted to TCC’s Information Security Officer.
                 After investigation of the incident, if notification of affected persons or
                 mitigation is required, departments and/or individuals involved in the
Privacy                                                                            Page 10 of 16

                 privacy breach may be asked to assist with the notification process
                 and/or in mitigating effects of the condition that caused the incident.
          4.3.2. Reporting a Privacy Complaint
                 Any individual who believes that his/her privacy rights have been
                 violated may file a complaint with TCC by completing and submitting a
                 Privacy Complaint form (Appendix H) to the College Privacy Officer. An
                 initial report may be filed with the College Privacy Officer verbally or by
                 written communication other than the college’s form. However, the
                 complainant or a designated representative must file the complaint form
                 in order to establish a formal complaint with the college.
                 The College Privacy Officer or designated representative will make every
                 effort to contact the individual filing the complaint within three (3)
                 business days of receiving notice of the complaint.
                 Following investigation of the complaint, the College Privacy Officer will
                 notify the complainant of the results of the investigation and the
                 corrective actions to be taken, if any.
    4.4. Investigating and Responding to Compromises of Personal Information
          4.4.1. Privacy Incidents
                 The College Privacy Officer or designated representative will:
                   1. Initiate a formal investigation immediately upon receipt of a report
                        of a Privacy Incident. The person notifying the College Privacy
                        Officer should complete a Privacy Incident Report form for this
                        purpose.
                   2. Determine whether the person(s) whose information is involved is
                        aware of the alleged incident.
                        a. If the person(s) is/are aware of the incident, contact
                            him/her/them within three (3) business days of receiving notice
                            of the incident. The method of contact is at the discretion of the
                            College Privacy Officer. Document the contact, and include the
                            date, time, and a general summary of any conversations or
                            messages left or received.
                        b. If the affected person(s) is/are not aware of the privacy incident,
                            investigate the alleged incident thoroughly before determining
                            whether they should be informed. (See Actions to be Taken
                            When a Privacy Violation is Found, following.)
                   3. Advise the College President and the respective vice president with
                        cognizance over the information involved in the incident of the
                        results of the investigation and any recommended actions.

                   5. Maintain all documentation for at least six years.
          4.4.2. Privacy Complaints
                 The College Privacy Officer or designated representative will:
                   1. Initiate a formal investigation immediately upon receipt of a
                        complaint of a violation of an individual’s privacy, whether the
                        complaint is made verbally or in writing.
                   2. Contact the complainant, preferably by telephone, within three (3)
                        business days of receiving notice of a complaint.
                        a. Advise the complainant of the investigation process.
                        b. Request any clarification regarding the complaint that may be
                            needed to facilitate the investigation.
                        c. If not already done, request that the complainant complete and
                            submit the Privacy Complaint form to formalize the complaint.
                        d. Document the conversation, including the date, time, and a
                            general summary of the conversation.
                        e. If a voice mail is left, continue to pursue direct communication.
                   3. Advise the College President and the respective vice president with
                        cognizance over the information involved in the incident of the

                   6. Maintain all documentation for at least six years.
          4.4.3. Response When No Compromise Is Found
                 If, after investigation of a reported incident or a complaint, the College
                 Privacy Officer determines that no compromise of Personal Information
                 occurred, the following actions will be taken to close out the matter.
                   1. The findings and any recommended actions will be documented in
                        the investigation report which will be maintained on file for at least
                        six years.

Policies and Procedures                                                            June 4, 2010
                   2. Appropriate notification of will be provided to the person(s) whose
                       Personal Information was involved.
                       a. For Privacy Incidents where no compromise is found, notify the
                           person(s) whose information was involved only if they were
                           already aware of the potential compromise. Document any
                           conversations, and provide written records of the incident
                           resolution, as appropriate.
                       b. For Privacy Complaints where no compromise is found, notify
                           the complainant upon conclusion of the investigation and
                           explain the findings; provide a written record of the complaint
                           resolution. Document the response to the notification,
                           specifically, whether the person was satisfied or dissatisfied with
                           the disposition of the complaint. If the complainant is not
                           satisfied, refer the matter to legal counsel as well as any other
                           college personnel directly involved, as necessary and
                           appropriate.
          4.4.4. Response When a Compromise Is Found
                 If, after investigation, the College Privacy Officer determines that a
                 compromise of Personal Information has occurred, the following actions
                 will be taken to close out the matter.
                   1. The findings and any recommended actions will be documented in
                       the investigation report which will be maintained on file for at least
                       six years.
                   2. The Privacy Oversight Committee will be convened to recommend
                       a corrective action and recovery plan, including any plans for
                       mitigation, where appropriate.
                   3. Notification of affected individuals will be undertaken as delineated
                       below.
                       a. For Privacy Incidents, the College Privacy Officer will assist the
                           college vice president with cognizance over the type of
                           information involved to notify all persons whose Personal
                           Information was compromised as soon as is practicable.
                           Appendix I provides guidance on the notification process. Any
                           subsequent conversations with the affected individuals will be

                                 INFORMATION PRIVACY STATEMENT
    Commitment to Privacy
    Tidewater Community College values each individual’s privacy and actively seeks to
    preserve the privacy rights of those who share information with the college. The trust of
    the college’s constituents is important to TCC, and those constituents have the right to
    know how information submitted to the college is generally handled.
    The following privacy notice is provided to define TCC's information policy and
    practices, and to assist the college’s constituents in protecting their privacy.
    Privacy Notice
    TCC has adopted the following privacy policies and practices for any and all parts of the
    college where Personal Information (PI) in any format is created, received,
    maintained, and transmitted. However, in legal terms, this notice shall not be construed
    as a contractual promise, and the college reserves the right to amend its policies at any
    time without notice. Privacy and public records obligations of the college are governed
    by applicable Virginia and federal laws and regulations.
    Personal Information (PI)
    The legal definition of Personal Information is provided in Code of Virginia § 2.2-3801
    and is included in TCC’s policy on Privacy. For practical purposes, PI may be

    The Information TCC Collects
    When a constituent contacts TCC, certain client information may be collected. No
    information is collected unless the constituent deliberately provides it to the college (for
    example, by leaving a name and telephone number, by completing a college form, or by
    clicking a web-link to send an e-mail to the college). Examples of the information that
    constituents might choose to give the college are listed below:
        • Name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address
        • Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses of family
            members and/or friends
        • Date of birth, ethnicity, gender, and country of origin
        • Height, weight, hair and eye color, and blood type
        • Academic history, including schools attended, grades received, and test scores
        • Financial profile, including income and assets
        • Employment history, including previous employers and duties
        • Credit or debit card and bank account information
        • Criminal history, including convictions, time served, and probation status
    The Way TCC Uses Information
    As a general rule, TCC maintains various types of records for individuals based upon
    their association with the college. TCC also aggregates information for resource
    management and planning purposes. TCC reserves the right to use information details
    about individuals to investigate its resource management or security concerns.
    Personal Information is used to accurately compile, store, and retrieve an individual's
    records; to place and track individuals appropriately for academic purposes, and to
    award academic degrees and honors; to properly employ individuals and compensate
    them for their work; to correctly diagnose and medically treat individuals; to respond
    appropriately (or in a personalized format) to individuals' requests for services; and to
    improve the college's services and products.
    Under The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), most records in the college’s
    possession are subject to inspection by or disclosure to members of the public upon
    their request. Information must be retained according to applicable federal and state
    laws, and must be available for inspection, unless otherwise exempt from FOIA.

Appendix A
    TCC uses the PI provided by a constituent placing a request for service only to
    complete that order or request. The college does not share this information with outside
    parties, except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request.
    TCC generally uses return addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses only
    to answer the communications received by the college. Such addresses are generally
    not used for any other purpose and by college and state policy are not shared with
    outside parties, except in accordance with FOIA.
    Finally, TCC does not use or share the PI provided to the college in ways unrelated to
    the purpose described without a clear notice in advance and without also providing the
    constituent an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
    Providing Information is Optional
    Except where otherwise provided by TCC policies and procedures for college
    employees, there is no legal requirement for a constituent to provide any information to
    TCC. However, most of the college’s services and products will not be available without
    the essential relevant information being provided by the constituent.
    TCC’s Commitment to Data Security
    TCC is committed to preventing unauthorized information access, maintaining
    information accuracy, and ensuring the appropriate use of information. The college
    strives to put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial safeguards to
    secure the information it collects in all formats: on paper, electronically, and verbally.
    These security practices are consistent with the college’s policies and with the laws and
    regulatory practices of the Commonwealth of Virginia and multiple federal agencies.

    practices we do not control.
    Information We Collect
    When you access our website, the routing or client information, and the essential and
    nonessential technical information listed below, is automatically collected. No other
    information is collected through our website except when you deliberately decide to
    send it to us (for example, by clicking on a link to send us an e-mail). The information
    you might choose to send us is listed below as "optional information."
    Routing, or client, information: the Internet domain and Internet address of the computer
    you are using.
    Essential technical information: identification of the page or service you are requesting,
    type of browser and operating system you are using; and the date and time of access.
    Nonessential technical information: the Internet address of the website from which you
    linked directly to our website, and the "cookie information" described below.
    Other optional information - when you send e-mail, we collect your name, e-mail
    address, and the content of your e-mail. When you complete online forms, we collect
    the data you choose to submit or confirm.

    preferences or customization that you might have set (including username and
    passwords).
    How the Collected Information Is Used
    Routing information is used to route the requested web page to your computer for
    viewing.
    We send the requested web page and the routing information to our Internet service
    provider or other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not
    control the privacy practices of those entities. Essential and nonessential technical
    information helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format [or in a
    personalized manner] and helps us plan website improvements.
    Optional information enables us to provide services or information tailored more
    specifically to your needs or to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that is
    better able to do so, and also allows us to plan website improvements.
    We may keep your information indefinitely, but we ordinarily delete the transaction
    routing information from our computer within _ days after the web page is transmitted
    and do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals who browse our
    website. However, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer
    security, logs of routing information are retained to permit a security investigation and in
    such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant information in our
    possession to law enforcement agencies.
    We use this transaction routing information primarily in a statistical summary type format
    to assess site content and server performance. We may share this summary information
    with our business partners when needed.
    Optional information is retained in accordance with the records retention schedules at
    the Library of Virginia.
    Under “The Virginia Freedom of Information Act”, any records in our possession at the
    time of a “Freedom of Information Request” might be subject to being inspected by, or
    disclosed to, members of the public. However, all identifiable confidential/personal
    information will be removed prior to releasing the routing information.
    Choice to Provide Information
    There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at our website.
    However, our website will not work without routing information and the essential
    technical information.
    Failure of your browser to provide nonessential technical information will not prevent
    your use of our website, but may prevent certain features from working. Failure to
    provide optional information will mean that the particular feature or service associated
    with that part of the web page will not be available to you.

                      GUIDELINES FOR PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION (PI)
   Personal Information (PI) is that sensitive information about a person which, if
   compromised, would subject the individual to identity theft or other potentially severe
   negative effects. Examples of PI include, but are not limited to:
       •   Social Security numbers (SSNs)
       •   Credit card or bank account numbers
       •   Medical or educational records
       •   Other sensitive, confidential or protected data (e.g., grades used in context with
           personally identifiable information such as name, address, or other easily
           traceable identifiers).
   The first step in protecting PI is to limit its collection and storage to only those instances
   dictated by law or support of essential college functions. Departments should review
   their processes for using PI annually:
       •   "Why are we acquiring SSNs or other PI?"
       •   "How are we storing any PI we do acquire?"
       •   "How are we protecting the PI that we acquire?"
       •   "What can we do to train our faculty and staff in the proper use and management
           of PI like SSNs, credit card numbers, and other confidential information?"
       •   "Who has access to PI in our department, and do they still need the access?"
   In addition, if you are asked to provide a SSN or other PI (either your own, another
   employee's, a student's, a family member's), challenge the request to insure that it is
   based on a legitimate need.
   The next step in protecting PI is to collect, process, and store it only on centrally
   managed systems (e.g., the Student Information System) that have appropriate security
   control measures in effect. Unless specifically authorized to do so by the college
   vice president responsible for the data and the Vice President for Information
   Systems, you may not store PI locally. "Locally" is defined as storing information
   directly on your college-owned computer.
   You may not download or otherwise copy PI from the centrally managed system on
   which it resides to your local computer without specific authorization from the
   responsible college vice president and the Vice President for Information Systems.
   You may not download to or otherwise store college data containing PI on a non-college
   owned system, such as your home computer, or to a portable computing system (e.g., a
   laptop), whether college-owned or not.
   You may not download to or otherwise store college data containing PI on portable
   storage media without the specific authorization from the responsible college vice
   president and the Vice President for Information Systems. Storage of PI deemed to be

Privacy
Appendix D
    sensitive data on portable storage media requires the specific authorization of the
    College President.
    If you have been authorized to store PI on a portable storage system, such as a
    CD/DVD or USB drive, you are responsible for protecting the data from compromise.
    When no longer required in support of college business, paper-based material
    containing PI shall be destroyed by shredding unless retention is required by federal or
    state law or regulation or by VCCS or college policy or procedure. Similarly, data
    containing PI shall be deleted from electronic storage media when no longer required
    for the conduct of college business.
    Finally, wise management of information system resources, including controlling access
    to storage areas through appropriate security measures (e.g., controlling keys, using
    strong passwords, etc.) is an essential element of protecting PI. Should you become
    aware that the security of a data storage system (paper- or computer-based) may have
    been breached, immediately notify the responsible supervisor who will advise the
    appropriate college vice president.

                       PROCEDURES FOR NOTIFICATION IN THE EVENT OF
                           COMPROMISE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
The Code of Virginia § 18.2-186.6 and the Virginia Information Technologies Agency
(VITA) Information Technology Security Standard (COV ITRM Standard SEC501-01)
require notification of potential victims of compromise of Personal Information under
certain circumstances. In cases of compromise of Personal Information not covered
under the Code or SEC501-01, the College Privacy Officer will determine the necessity
and method of notification using these procedures as a guide.
Under the Code and SEC501-01, notification is required when computerized data that
contain the following Personal Information elements are compromised and when the
data elements are neither encrypted nor redacted.
    a. the first name or first initial and last name in combination with and linked to any
       one or more of the following data elements;
    b. Social Security number;
    c. Driver’s license number or state identification card number issued in lieu of a
       driver’s license number;
    d. financial account number, or credit card or debit card number, in combination
       with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit
       access to a resident’s financial accounts; or
    e. other personal identifying information, such as insurance data or date of birth.
“Redact” means alteration or truncation of data such that no more than the following are
accessible as part of the information:
    a. five digits of a Social Security number; or
    b. the last four digits of a driver’s license number, state identification card number,
       or account number.
The notification requirement does not apply to information that is lawfully obtained from
publicly available information or from federal, state, or local government records lawfully
made available to the general public.
In the event of compromise of PI as delineated above, TCC will provide appropriate
notice to affected individuals in the event of compromise of unencrypted and/or un-
redacted PI as delineated above by any mechanism, including, but not limited to:
    a. theft or loss of digital media including laptops, desktops, tablets, CD’s, DVD’s,
       tapes, USB drives, SD cards, etc.;
    b. theft or loss of physical hardcopy; or
    c. security compromise of any system.

    Notice is also required if encrypted information is accessed and acquired in an
    unencrypted form, or if the security breach involves a person with access to the
    encryption key.
    In the case of a computer found to be infected with malware that exposes data to
    unauthorized access, individuals that may have had their information exposed due to
    use of that computer must be alerted in accordance with data breach rules.
    The notice shall be provided without undue delay as soon as verification of the
    compromise is confirmed, except if law-enforcement is notified and the law enforcement
    agency determines and advises the college that the notice would impede a criminal or
    civil investigation, or homeland security or national security. Notice shall be made
    without unreasonable delay after the law enforcement agency determines that the
    notification will no longer impede the investigation or jeopardize national or homeland
    security.
    The notification will consist of:
         a. a general description of what occurred and when;
         b. the type of PI that was involved;
         c. what actions have been taken to protect the individual’s personal information
            from further unauthorized access;
         d. a telephone number that the person may call for further information and
            assistance; and
         e. what actions the affected individuals should take. The actions recommended
            should include monitoring their credit reports and reviewing their account
            statements.
    The notification will be provide by one or more of the following methodologies, listed in
    order of preference:
         a. written notice to the last known postal address in the records of the individual;
         b. telephone notice;
         c. electronic notice; or
         d. substitute notice – if the cost of providing notice will exceed $50,000, the affected
            class of Virginia residents to be notified exceeds 100,000 residents, or the
            individual or the entity does not have sufficient contact information or legal
            consent to provide notice. Substitute notice consists of all of the following:
               i. e-mail notice if the e-mail addresses for the members of the affected class of
                  residents are available;
              ii. conspicuous posting of the notice on the TCC website; and
             iii. notice to major statewide media.
    If the notice must be provided to more than 1,000 persons at one time, TCC will notify,
    without unreasonable delay, the Office of the Attorney General and all consumer
    reporting agencies that compile and maintain files on consumers on a nationwide basis,
    as defined in 15 U.S.C.§1681(a)(p), of the timing, distribution, and content of the notice.
