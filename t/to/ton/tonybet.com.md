**SECURITY POLICY**

We understand that keeping Your information secured is vital. Therefore, every day We work on improving appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of Our services, systems and processes. This helps Us protect the information We have against misuse and also ensures the continuity of Our services. However, this does not mean that Our systems are immune to problems. If problems are detected, We would like to receive Your notice or help.

## _How We keep Your information safe?_

All information transmitted online is encrypted using advanced logarithm combinations. All communication between You and TonyBet is encrypted to the maximum strength supported by Your browser using 256 Bit SSL encryption.

Since You register or log-in, all information sent to and from TonyBet website is encrypted using 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software. This system ensures that all the information You provide using TonyBet website (such as your Personal Data) is automatically protected. We secure Your private information using GoDaddy SSL Certificates.

Moreover, We have excellent fraud team and advanced systems for detection and prevention of suspicious or illegal activities. Any account involved in suspicious activity will be suspended and investigated. If You have any doubts that Your account was compromised (e.g. unusual changes in the balance or an email notification of a password change without any action by You), please change your password and contact TonyBet [customer support](https://tonybet.com/contacts) service immediately.

## _How You can protect Your data?_

Here are a few things You can do to keep Your account secure:

  * **Never share Your online account.** You should not share Your account or use another person’s account even though the person you would be sharing with is your family member or a friend.  Moreover, please keep in mind that to share Your account is strictly forbidden as described in Our Regulation.
  * **Protect Your password.** Do not use Your password anywhere else online. Your password should be difficult to guess. Avoid including your name or common words.
  * **Use strong passwords.** Make your password as random as possible, but easy for you to remember. Your password should be long enough, unconventional, a mix of different types of characters, better if not a dictionary word. Don't use numbers or combinations associated with other personally identifiable information as all or even part of your passwords.
  * **Change passwords regularly** , especially when there is any doubt that they may have been compromised. 
  * **Never share Your log in information.** Do not divulge personal information about your account including passwords to anyone – even people who claim to be from customer service or security. Keep in mind that We will never ask You for Your password.
  * **Do not write down your password or save it on your computer or mobile device**. A Post-It note stuck to the outside of Your laptop or mobile phone is "akin to leaving your keys in your car".
  * **Do not leave your computer or mobile device unlocked.** It can take only seconds for someone to use this easy access and get the information they need for further malicious activities. Moreover, all it takes is a single mishap where your device slips out of your pocket or briefcase at a restaurant or on public transportation, and your data could wind up in the hands of someone who will use it maliciously.
  * **Do not use the same passwords** for your operation systems and software/accounts passwords.
  * **Don't save passwords in your browser**. Common practice of 'remembering passwords' in browsers is a dangerous practice. Indeed, should someone gain access to your computer or mobile device, they'd be able to easily access any accounts for which you've stored login credentials in your browser.
  * **Keep your anti-virus software up-to-date.** Run a good anti-virus protection program, do periodic scans for spyware, avoid clicking on suspicious email links or websites.
  * **Keep your operating system, browser, and plugins up-to-date.** These updates contain critical security patches that will protect your computer or mobile device from recently discovered threats. Failing to install these updates means your computer/mobile device is at risk.
  * **Make sure your firewall is secure**. Firewalls assist in blocking dangerous programs, viruses or spyware before they infiltrate in your system.
  * **Avoid logging in to your TonyBet account on public computers** – e.g. libraries, internet cafes, etc.
  * **Avoid transactions on public Wi-Fi.** Unlike your home computer, use of public hotspots involves security compromises. It is easy for other users to intercept your data, so be careful about what information you send while connected.
  * **Secure your Wi-Fi network** at home or workplace. It's always recommended to secure your wireless network with a password. This prevents unauthorized individuals within proximity to hijack your wireless network. Even if they're merely attempting to get free Wi-Fi access, you don't want to inadvertently share private information with other people who are using your network without permission.
  * **Look for key markers.** We rely on universally accepted security protocol HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) to protect users and keep their transactions secure. Therefore, Our website will show a green marker in the browser URL and link address will start with https instead of http or www. Always check the name of sender in the email carefully before clicking on any attachment or links. Most malware attacks are sent through bogus email IDs.



## _HAS YOUR ACCOUNT BEEN COMPROMISED?_

Your account may have been compromised if:

  * There have been changes to your account details that you didn't commit, such as your e-mail, home address or phone number.
  * There has been activity within your account that was not done by you. This could include deposits or withdrawals, or bets placed.
  * You have received an email notification of a password change without any action by you.



If You have any doubts that Your account was compromised, please change your password and contact TonyBet [customer support](https://tonybet.com/contacts) service immediately.
