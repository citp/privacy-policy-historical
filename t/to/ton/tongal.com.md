# Tongal™

Our privacy policy describes the information we collect and how we use it.

Tongal values privacy as much as we value your submissions to our Contests, and therefore we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe and secure user experience. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private. Your personal information is immediately transferred from our Web server to behind our firewall, where it remains isolated from a direct connection to the Internet. By using this Web site, and in doing so accepting the Terms and Conditions of Use under which you may use this Web site (see [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20100516201745id_/http%3A//www.tongal.com/terms.shtml)), you consent to the use of your personal information as described in this privacy policy.

Our privacy policy and security measures are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. You should understand, however, that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. The information that you submit to us is used only for the purposes as set forth herein, as required by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required to protect our rights. We will not use your personal information for any purpose other than as set out here without first obtaining your permission. The following reflects our commitment to you.

### Information About You Specifically

If you choose to register as a member in order to participate in Tongal Contests, you will provide us with additional information about yourself, including your name, handle (i.e., public login name) and address. If you are a winner, for legal purposes we will also request confirmation of your date of birth. In addition, if you are a U.S. person (including U.S. resident aliens), we will request your social security number (or taxpayer identification number) on IRS form W-9. If you are a winner, and you are not a U.S. person, we will request a Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding on IRS form W-8BEN. We use this information to verify your eligibility to participate in Contests, and to contact you and properly notify the IRS should you be a winner. From time to time, we may use the contact information to alert members of new Contests and communicate news, events and reminders. During a Contest, users participating will be shown and identified only by their handles, which are their public login names. A Tongal member's handle, rating, country, school, Contest statistics, date registered, winnings to date, skill set, and personal quote will be publicly available to any participants of the Tongal Web site.

Spectators may be allowed to view a Contest without identifying themselves, but Contest participants must be members and must log in to prove it. All content submitted during a Contest will be available to anyone spectators, members and sponsors�and may be subject to challenge from other members of Tongal. Winners' names may be released to governmental authorities as required by law. At registration, we will ask you to answer questions regarding certain demographic information as it relates to your status as a student or a professional.

As a Tongal member, you may choose to create a more extensive profile that includes your work and educational experience, as well as your relevant skills. You have the ability to update and change this information at any time and we encourage you to keep it updated.

In certain circumstances such as participating in certain Contests, Tongal sponsors and subscribing employers will be given access to view your demographic information, educational and work experience (if provided by you), and contact information.

The personal information you provide must be accurate and complete and all registration details (where applicable) must contain your real name, address and other requested details. You are solely responsible for your personal information and we may take any action with respect to your personal information we deem necessary or appropriate if we believe it may cause us to suffer any loss, liability or commercial damage.

Tongal makes forum-style discussion topics available to our members and sponsors. These forums will identify Tongal members by their user handles. Those simply viewing the forums may do so without identifying themselves, but those who wish to participate must be members or sponsors and must log in to prove it. Please remember that any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information. Accordingly, you should always exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.
