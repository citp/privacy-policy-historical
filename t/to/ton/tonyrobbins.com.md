## 7.2           The legal basis for processing your Personal Data

In order to comply with the GDPR, we are required to set out the legal basis for the processing of your Personal Data.  In accordance with the purposes for which we collect and use your Personal Data, as set out above, the legal basis for processing your Personal Data will typically be one of the following:

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.  Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

## 7.4           Addendum to how long we store your Personal Data

In some cases, there is a legal requirement to keep Personal Data for a minimum period of time.  Except in those circumstances, we do not keep your Personal Data for any longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.

All of these rights are subject to certain conditions and exemptions.  For example, RRI will not be obligated to erase your Personal Data if we need to retain it to protect ourselves in the event of a legal claim.
