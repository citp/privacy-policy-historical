How is the information collected online from Tobii Dynavox used?

  1. Whenever you request information or ask a question via our website, we require you to submit your name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address. This provides us with the information we need to send the materials to you or contact you should we have any questions about your request.
  2.  If you ask a technical support question, we also ask you to provide a product serial number if at all possible. This allows us to log your request in our database file for that individual Tobii or Dynavox product. Creating this log allows our technical support staff to develop a profile specific to your device or software and ultimately serve you better.
