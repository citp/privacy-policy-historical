##   
Our Privacy Commitment to you

Toluna is an online data collection group focused on providing high-quality data to our clients who are mainly in the market and marketing research industries, as well as being in other many other business sectors. We build and maintain large online consumer panels, providing real-time digital consumer insights to our clients via our market research survey and analytics platforms. You can be assured your privacy and the confidentiality of your information is of the utmost importance to us. All of the data we collect via our research studies are provided to our clients in aggregate form i.e. information is provided about groups of individuals and not on an individual level. Personal information about you would only be provided to our clients in specific research studies and we would never provide your personal information to our clients unless we have first received your consent. All personal information you do provide to us is held securely, in confidence and in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.  
 

## The information we collect

Your participation in any of our panels and surveys is voluntary. To become a panel member, you must fill out a registration form, available on our Website and mobile application or via links displayed on our partners’ websites, that gathers some personal and general consumer information about you. By doing so, you acknowledge and agree that you provide personal information to our USA based company; Toluna USA Inc., (“ **Toluna USA** ”) and that such information will be stored on servers owned by us and located in the USA. We ask for your email address so that we can send you email invitations to participate in our upcoming surveys. The other information we gather, such as your name, address, gender, birthday, household size, income, education and employment status is for matching you with the appropriate marketing research projects. Your birthday is used to automatically update your age for us to target age-related marketing groups. We ask you for this information as a means to see if you might qualify for particular projects. All email contact from Toluna will be sent to your primary email address that you gave to us upon registration. If you become a panel member, your information (name and full postal address) is also used for the purposes of incentive fulfillment. When incentive points are deposited in your account and you wish to redeem them, this information is required so that we may send your reward to the appropriate recipient address. From time to time, a third party may be used for issuing cheques or processing the delivery of rewards; your personal information will not be used for any other reason.  
After registration, you may complete your profile and provide us with more personal information so that we may invite you to appropriate surveys.  

In some circumstances, Toluna may ask you to inform us of your sensitive personal information and if required by law, we will ask you for your consent to the processing of such sensitive personal information. Examples of sensitive personal information are; your racial or ethnic origin; your political opinions; you physical or mental health or condition; and your sexual life.  This information will only be shared with third parties if necessary for specific research studies and only if you have provided your prior consent to the participation in such studies.  We may provide sensitive personal information about you if required by a court order to do.

If you take a survey or provide us with personal information without being a member of our panel, the only personal information we will preserve is your email address, gender, age and zip/postal code, machine ID and IP address and (if permitted by law; your ethnicity).  We do this so we may contact you if you have won a prize or are entitled to an incentive, to match you to appropriate surveys and improve the user experience. Unless you elect to become a member of the Toluna panel, we will not contact you for any reason other than to notify you that you have won a prize or are eligible for an incentive. If you are entitled to a prize or an incentive, we will collect and maintain such personal information, as we are required to maintain or report by virtue of any law or regulation.

You should be aware that any personal information you choose to make public on the site, in the Community area (under a public message on your wall, as an opinion, topic, battle, thumb it, or any other public area or forum) can be read, collected, or used by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit or make public. In addition, we are not responsible for the content you publicly post on the site that can be found via web-based search engines. Our website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [privacy@toluna.com](mailto:privacy@toluna.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, (unless required by law) in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
