<p>Overall privacy</p>

<p>Commitment<br>
<br>
 Toluna SAS is an online data collection company focused on
providing high quality data to the full-service marketing research
industry, advertising agencies and consultancies. We build and
maintain large online consumer Panels. You can be assured your
privacy and the confidentiality of your information is our number
one priority. All of the data that Toluna SAS collects in our
research studies report as aggregate information, that is,
information about groups - not individuals. Individual information
is never reviewed or published without your consent, as it is
irrelevant to the research conducted by our clients. All individual
information provided is held confidential in accordance with the
terms of this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
 The Information We Gather<br>
<br>
 Toluna SAS gathers personal information when an individual
registers to become a member of our panels. Your participation in
any of our panels and surveys is voluntary. After registration we
ask panel members to provide us with more personal information so
that we may invite them to appropriate surveys. To become a panel
member, we ask that you fill out a registration survey that gathers
some personal and general consumer information. We ask for your
email address so that we can send you email invitations to
participate in our upcoming surveys. The other information we
gather, such as your name, address, gender, birthday, and
employment status, is for matching you with the appropriate
marketing research projects. Your birthday is used to automatically
update your age for us to target age-related marketing groups. We
ask you for this information as a means to see if you might qualify
for particular projects. All email contact from Toluna SAS will be
sent to your primary email address that you gave to us upon
registration. If you become a panel member, your information (name,
address, city, state, and zip) is also used for the purposes of
incentive fulfilment. When incentive points are deposited in your
account and you wish to redeem them, this information is required
so that we may send your reward to the appropriate recipient
address. From time to time, a third party may be used for issuing
checks or processing the delivery of rewards; your personally
identifiable information will not be used for any other reason, but
to mail you your reward.<br>
<br>
 In some circumstances, Toluna SAS may ask you to inform us of your
sensitive personal data, unless we are permitted to process such
sensitive personal data by law, we will ask for your consent. In
general sensitive data that may be collected by Toluna SAS may
cover: your racial or ethnic origin; your political opinions; your
physical or mental health or condition; and your sexual life. This
information is not shared with any third party, except as required
by law and as part of a transfer of Toluna SAS's business.<br>
<br>
 If you take a survey or provide us with personal information
without being a member of our panel, the only personally
identifiable information we will preserve is your email address,
gender, age, ethnicity and zip code, machine ID and IP address. We
do this so we may contact you if you have won a prize or are
entitled to an incentive, to match you to appropriate surveys and
improve the user experience. Unless you elect to become a member of
the Toluna SAS panel, we will not contact you for any reason other
than to notify you that you have won a prize or are eligible for an
incentive. If you are entitled to a prize or an incentive, we will
collect and maintain such personally identifiable information, as
we are required to maintain or report by virtue of any law or
regulation.<br>
<br>
 If you use the Community Forum Area on our website to post blogs,
bulletins or chat with fellow community members, you should be
aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there
can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and
could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not
responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose
to submit in these forums.<br>
<br>
 Use of This Information<br>
<br>
 Toluna SAS does not sell or transfer the personally identifiable
information collected about the members of its panels or the
individuals that take surveys for us. Information which is
personally identifiable will only be transferred with your prior
permission on a case by case basis, except for the narrow
exceptions specified below. If you are a member of the Toluna SAS
panel, your information is stored in our proprietary database so we
may call upon it to determine which people match up with specific
research studies. If we think your profile makes you a potential
candidate for a study, we will email you an invitation to make you
aware of this opportunity. From time to time Toluna SAS may use
third-party software for email list management and email
distribution, or may use third party list management providers to
match the members of our Panel to members of other lists or panels,
or to validate accuracy of personal information you provide. We may
use third parties to provide us with data they have collected about
you, and append this data to your demographic profile. In such
cases only a minimum amount of information is transferred to these
third parties so as to enable them to perform specific functions on
our behalf. We also may share your information with our service
providers, such as to provide prizes you have won or other
incentives for your participation in our panels.<br>
<br>
 Your information may be transferred to other countries, including
the United States. All such transfers shall solely be made in
accordance with applicable law.</p>

in place and their use by Toluna SAS and Toluna SAS's clients and
business partners. The cookies will expire after one year.<br>
<br>
 Site users may disable the installation of "cookies " or to delete
cookies installed by Toluna SAS or its clients. To do so you should
modify your browser settings click on the help section of your
Internet browser and follow the instructions.<br>
<br>
 Local Shared Objects: In order to enhance your experience as a
panel member and to increase your opportunities to participate in
surveys, Toluna would like to install an application on your
computer that will collect limited data about certain websites you
visit and certain advertisements that are displayed to you during
your website browsing. The application consists of an HTML cookie
and local shared object (LSO).<br>
<br>
 The application will signal when you visit a website that utilizes
a participating internet advertising network. The signal emitted
from the application identifies tags contained in certain on-line
advertisements relating to our clients. It will update us when you
interact with these ads so we can send you relevant surveys for you
to complete. This will not affect the performance of your computer
but simply provide you with additional opportunities to receive
more surveys relevant to your interests.<br>
<br>
 In addition, it will be possible for clients to determine on which
site the specific advertisement was viewed. We provide only limited
non-personally identifiable information to our clients, including
certain demographic information and a coded user identification
number so that your personal information will not be tied to your
browsing data. In addition, in the event of a merger or other sale
of Toluna or its client or as required by applicable law, the
anonymous data collected by the application may be shared with
third parties.<br>
<br>
 LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and
type of data stored and how the data are stored. Cookie management
tools provided by your browser and many anti-spyware applications
will not remove Flash cookies, nor will the "Private Browsing"
modes on your browser prevent their placement on your computer. You
can, however, manage privacy and storage settings for local shared
objects or disable their use entirely by visiting the website of
Macromedia, the manufacturer of Flash Player, at the following
link:<br>
 <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">
http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a><br>
<br>
 Please note that the local shared object may restore a deleted
HTML cookie in order to keep the application functioning
properly.<br>
<br>
 If in the future you change your mind about participating in the
application program, please contact: <a href="mailto:privacyna@toluna.com">privacyna@toluna.com</a>.<br>
<br>
 We will record your preference not to participate in the
application. We and our client take commercially reasonable efforts
to keep your data secure, including technical, physical and
administrative safeguards. For example, all of our storage servers
are protected by firewalls.<br>
<br>
 Digital Finger printing: In general, digital fingerprinting
technologies assign a unique identifier or "Machine-ID" to a user's
computer to identify and track the computer. Toluna SAS will not
use digital fingerprinting technology (the "Technology") to collect
Personal Information, or track the online activities, of the user
of a computer; and will not disrupt or interfere with the use or
control of a computer or alter, modify or change the settings or
functionality of a computer. Toluna SAS will use the Technology to
assist Toluna SAS's clients in ensuring the integrity of survey
results. The Technology will analyse publicly available information
and data obtained from the computer's web browser and from other
publicly available data points, including without limitation the
technical settings of the computer, the characteristics of the
computer, and the computer's IP Address, to create a unique
identifier assigned to the computer. The unique identifier will be
an alpha-numeric id. After creating the unique identifier, Toluna
SAS does not retain the information 0d by the Technology to create
the unique identifier. In furtherance of Toluna SAS's efforts to
assist its clients in protecting and ensuring the integrity of
survey results, Toluna SAS (a) may link or associate your unique
identifier to you and any of your Personal Information; (b) may
share your unique identifier with Toluna SAS's clients and with
other sample or panel providers; and (c) may receive or obtain a
unique identifier linked to you from a third party, including
without limitation a sample or panel provider or a client of Toluna
SAS. Any unique identifier(s) received or obtained by Toluna SAS
and linked to a specific individual will be protected in accordance
with this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
 Toluna SAS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that the Technology is safe, secure and does not cause undue
privacy or data security risks.<br>
<br>
 Toluna SAS shall use and distribute the Technology in a
professional and ethical manner and in accordance with (a) Toluna
SAS's privacy policy, (b) any statements and/or disclosures made by
Toluna SAS to respondents, and (c) applicable Laws and Codes.<br>
<br>
 In the event that Toluna SAS discovers or learns of any unethical
conduct in connection with the use of the Technology, or that the
Technology is being used in a manner that is inconsistent with the
statements and/or disclosures made by Toluna SAS to respondents or
in violation of applicable Laws and Codes, Toluna SAS will take
immediate action to prohibit such unethical conduct and to ensure
the proper administration of the Technology.</p>

winnings. Once we deposit winnings in accounts, panelists have the
option to request that a check be mailed to them at any time. For
more information, please visit our Terms and Conditions page. Cash
and other prizes awarded to non-panel members will be awarded

a part of our research. We may be required by law to ask for your
social security number or other government-issued identifier to
comply with reporting laws and regulations if you are the recipient
of survey incentives. We use SSL encryption when collecting or
transmitting sensitive information. Your profile information is
highly confidential and will be used only by Toluna SAS to email
you concerning our studies, newsletters, winner notifications, and
incentive redemptions, or as otherwise provided for in this privacy
policy.<br>

 As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy
additional assets. In such transactions, Toluna SAS's right to
contact its panel members and the information you have voluntarily
provided in your user profile would generally be one of the
transferred business assets. Any sale or transfer of Toluna SAS or
substantially all of its business assets, which included our panel,
would be to an entity that agreed to comply with all of the
material terms of our privacy policy.<br>
