Registration Number: Z2312131<br><br> At Towah <strong>["Towah", "we" or "us"]</strong>, we work hard to keep the information you give us safe. We follow strict security procedures on how your personal information is stored and used, to help stop any unauthorised person accessing it.<br><br> Please read through this privacy policy carefully, as it is part of our terms of use. By using the my.towah.com and towah.com websites, you are agreeing to be bound by our Terms and Conditions.<br><br> This policy describes how we collect, use and look after the information you provide us with when you use Towah’s products and services.</p>
<p><strong>Using your information</strong></p>
<p>Collecting this information helps us better understand what you need from us. We use it to offer you products and services that we think will be relevant to you. The main uses of your data are:<br><br> • Providing you with the service(s) that you have requested<br> • To enable us to review, develop and improve the products and services<br> • To send you details of products, services, special offers and rewards that we think will be of interest to you - however, you are able to <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; decide whether or not you want to receive this information<br> • To compile statistical analysis of the pages of our website which you visit<br> • Link online behaviour to subsequent application / registration details (if these are completed)<br> • Evaluate our sites advertising and promotional effectiveness</p>
<p><strong>Disclosing your information</strong></p>
<p>Here's when we may provide information about you:<br><br> • To employees and agents of Towah to deal with any accounts, products and services provided to you by us or our group companies now <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;or in the future<br> • You give us your consent<br> • We may use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and our service and may provide such anonymised aggregate information to third parties for example content partners and advertisers -&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; these statistics will not include information that can be used to identify you<br> • The law permits or requires it, or any other regulatory body requests or requires it, even without your consent<br> • There is a duty to the public to reveal the information</p>
<p><strong>Protecting your information</strong></p>
<p>Any information sent to us by customers via our website is protected by encryption using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. This is industry standard encryption technology that protects your data whilst being sent over the internet from being intercepted and misused by third parties. When it reaches us, we then store it on secure servers so that it can only be read by authorized personnel.<br><br> Our website contains links to other websites, which may well have different privacy and security policies to us. Please remember, we don’t have any control over these websites, so we can’t take responsibility for any information you give them.<br><br> We take security extremely seriously but as no system is 100% secure, we can’t completely guarantee the protection of your personal information, any more than any other organisation can. So we can’t accept any liability for the loss, theft or misuse of your personal details when they are processed on this website or the internet generally.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing your information</strong></p>
<p>You have full access to all information stored about you. You can ask us at any time to give you details about what your information is being used for and who else might see it. You may have to pay a small administration fee for this. Also, please ask if you would like us to change or delete any personal information you have previously given us. If we can we will, but sometimes we have to keep your records for legal reasons. If you'd like us to send your information, you can write to our team at the address at the bottom of this policy.</p>
