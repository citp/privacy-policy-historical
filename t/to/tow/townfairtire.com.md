Information You Provide To Us.

Collection and Use of Personal Information. We receive and may keep information voluntarily given to us when you decided to make a purchase, register for an appointment on the Website, take part in an online special promotion, or provide any other information or unique preferences to better serve you. We may collect personal information (information that can be used to identify you as an individual) such as your name, email, and telephone number. The types of personal information we collect may vary depending on your use of the features of the Website. 

Information Collected Automatically.

Collection and Use of Usage Information. Whenever you visit or interact with our Website, we may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect non-personally identifiable information about how the Website is accessed and used, such as browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, your geo-location, the preceding page views, and your use of features or applications on the Website. This information helps us keep our Website fresh and interesting to our visitors and allows us to tailor content to users’ interests. 

Collection and Use of IP Addresses. We or our service providers automatically collect your IP address you use to access the Website. We may use this information to administer the Website, help diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends about a user’s use of the Website, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Collection and Use of Cookies. When you visit our Website we store certain information on your computers or mobile devices known as “cookies.” Cookies may also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on the Website and your activities on such social networking sites. We, or our service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your computers or mobile device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Website. 

A cookie is a small text file that a website can place on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping or other administrative purposes. Our Website may use cookies to help to personalize your experience on the Website. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Although most web browsers accept cookies automatically, usually you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or (ii) set your browser to automatically reject any cookies.

Use of Google Analytics and Google Adwords. We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this Website for remarketing purposes. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. Town Fair Tire uses the information obtained through the use of Google Analytics only to improve this Website.

We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. 

This Website also uses the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Website. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this Website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics and Google Adwords about your visits to this Website is restricted by this privacy policy, Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Website by disabling cookies on your browser. You can also set preferences for how Google advertises to you, including the option to opt-out of internet-based advertising on Google, by accessing and using the [Google Ad Preferences page.](http://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TChANxthiApdkgeBVLjmOBbSwETOTwFBt6t5_zywzxC3qgdVEEXlAyLOznbEBu1dwwfDd75azxdHKuK1Z-IUDlw1lIWvDQ)
