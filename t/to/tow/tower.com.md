## Privacy Policy

Effective date: May 18th, 2007 to April 28th 2010.

Tower.com's Commitment to Safe Internet Shopping

We offer 128-bit SSL encryption, which encrypts your personal and credit card information as it is transferred over the Internet. 

We electronically verify each order with the credit company at the moment it is placed, returning an order confirmed message only if the issuing bank authorizes it. Our experienced staff then manually checks all orders which still appear unusual, canceling any we feel are not valid.

In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, federal law states that you will not be liable for more than $50 of fraudulent charges. Tower.com will cover this liability, up to $50, as long as the following is true:

  1. You have reported the fraudulent use to the issuing bank of your credit card according to their reporting rules and procedures. 
  2. The unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own. 
  3. The credit card number was obtained from purchases made at Tower.com while using our secure server.
