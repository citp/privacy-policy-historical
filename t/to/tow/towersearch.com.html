Depending on how you have configured your browser, when you access our website, a small file - a “cookie” - may be created by our server and stored on your computer. The cookie contains a unique session identification number and is used to:
       </p><p>• keep track of your online order;<br>
• ensure that you see the correct products and pricing applicable to the province in which you are located; <br>
• personalize your experience by alerting you to features and information that might interest you;<br>

       </p><h3><strong>Aggregate Information</strong></h3>
       <p>We collect certain aggregate information, such as tracking the Internet address of the domains from which you visit our site and analyzing this data for trends and statistics, tracking your IP address (the number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you are using the Web), and tracking your browser type. We use this aggregate information to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our website, and to gather broad demographic information. None of this information is connected with your personal information. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information provided during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of clients).
       </p><h3><strong>Use of IP Addresses</strong></h3>
       <p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our website. When clients request pages from our website, our servers log the requesting clients' IP addresses. We normally will not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that clients' sessions will be logged, but client identity remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a client when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, website, or any person, or where it is otherwise authorized or required by law.

          (ii) a company or individual engaged by us to perform functions on its behalf, such as research or data processing;<br>
          (iii) a credit reporting agency;<br>
          (iv) a public authority or agent of a public authority, if in our reasonable judgement, it appears that there is imminent danger to life or property which could be avoided or minimized by disclosure of the information; or <br>
          (v) where you consent to such disclosure or it is required or authorized by law. We may use and disclose employee personal information for a variety of purposes related to commencing, managing or terminating the employment relationship. We do not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease any personal information collected at our site, including contact forms, download requests or email lists. We will retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes stated above, as required for legal or business purposes or as required by law. Subsequently, we will destroy, erase, or make anonymous such information.

       <p>Upon reasonable written notice from you, we will, within 30 days or such longer period in the event we obtain an extension, provide access to all your personal information in our possession and tell your what the information is being used for and to whom it has been disclosed. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for providing access to personal information. If we refuse your request for access, we will notify you in writing, documenting the reasons for refusal, the relevant provision of the Act on which we rely and resources for redress available to you, including from the British Columbia Information and Privacy Commissioner.

       </p><h3><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></h3>
       <p>We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of websites to which our website may link and our privacy policy does not apply to those websites. These other websites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.
