**How Tower Hobbies Protects Your Online Privacy**

Tower Hobbies is a firm believer in the protection of its online customers' privacy. We have implemented a number of procedures and policies which are designed to protect your personal information while using our online services. 

Tower Hobbies has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this site. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their e-mail address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. If you choose a third-party billing option, financial and personal information will be provided to the billing company. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Our site uses "cookies" to keep track of your shopping cart. 

  * Whenever sensitive personal or financial information is transmitted, it is sent via a [secured connection](https://web.archive.org/web/20030606223042id_/http%3A//www.towerhobbies.com/help/security.html) directly to our mainframe computer using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology. This is the most successfully used method of ensuring private, secure transmission of personal information over the Internet. 
  * Our online systems do not relay or retransmit your information insecurely to other computers--when you send personal information using our online ordering system, it is directly passed to our main IBM AS/400 system. 
  * E-mail addresses are collected only for the purpose of contacting you in the future. We WILL NOT sell or rent your e-mail address to other companies or individuals. 
  * We do not collect the personal information for children under the age of 13. We are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary. In cases where we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child, the parent can always review this information, choose to have this information deleted from our records and refuse to permit further collection or use of this information. 
  * We do occasionally share portions of our customer postal mailing list with trusted and approved high-quality companies. We choose these companies on a very high standard and will only allow postal mailings for offers which we feel you may be interested in. _We never sell or rent e-mail addresses, phone numbers or financial information._

This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service. 
  1. You can send e-mail to [orders@towerhobbies.com](mailto:orders@towerhobbies.com)
  2. You can send mail to the following postal address:  Tower Hobbies, PO Box 9078, Champaign, IL, 61826 
  3. You can call the following telephone numbers: 800-637-4989 or 217-398-3636. 



Tower Hobbies respects its customers' privacy and works diligently to protect it.
