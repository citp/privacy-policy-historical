# Terms of Use & Privacy Policy | TownPost

### Guidelines for Posting in the Buy & Sell section

**We strongly encourage including a price** \- We request that visitors post items individually with a price whenever possible.  
**Avoid Posting Duplicates** \- We request that users post their item on their local TownPost site and refrain from re-posting those ads under other towns. We have added a "[bump my ad](https://townpost.ca/contact/bumpmyad)" request at the bottom of each ad as an alternative to re-posting ads.  
**Follow Laws and Government Regulations** \- Users of this site agree to take responsibility for content they post, by using this site you agree to comply with Health Canada's [Consumer Product Safety Guidelines](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/pubs/cons/garage-eng.php) and all other applicable Canadian laws and regulations. We do allow ads for firearms provided they are in compliance with the RCMP and Canadian Regulations on [Selling, Giving or Trading Firearms](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/sell-vendre-eng.htm). TownPost is not responsible for transactions resulting from the use of this site, but we will remove and ban any ads or users found violating any of these terms.  
**Business Ads Permitted** \- Businesses are welcome to post classified ads free of charge for new or used products, clearance items, and store fixtures. However, we also request that businesses use discretion and moderation. Posts that explicitly advertise another website, competing service, or we deem as a conflict of interest will be removed without notice. We reserve the right to filter, hide, or delete ads using our own editorial discretion. Ads posted advertising a services or business offers should be categorized under Business Ads / Services. If you are asking our visitors to go to another website, to a Facebook page, or the ad contains a link to external websites it must be a paid ad. Paid ads must also include descriptions, prices, and photos to avoid filtering in category pages.  
**MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) or Affiliate Ads** \- We do not allow any posts advertising products or services using multi-level marketing techniques, pyramid schemes, or affiliate programs. These posts will be rejected without notification and in some cases the user account will be removed.
