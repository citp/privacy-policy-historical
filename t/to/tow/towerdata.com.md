# TowerData | Privacy Policy

For TowerData's Safe Harbor Privacy Policy, [click here](http://www.towerdata.com/company/eu_privacy_policy.html "click here").

The TowerData Privacy Policy is our way of ensuring the safety and accuracy of Internet users' personal information, whether gathered on this site, by our clients, or by our partners.

We are in the email business and understand the importance of personal information security. We only work with companies that protect the personal information they collect from their existing or potential customers.  We respect your privacy and are committed to safeguarding your privacy.  This “Privacy Policy” discloses how we gather and use personal information.

## **How We Gather Information**

TowerData is in the business of intermediating between consumers who wish to receive highly valuable promotions, goods and services and companies who offer those promotions, goods and services.

When you visit our website, [www.towerdata.com](http://www.towerdata.com/ "www.towerdata.com"), we collect the information you voluntarily give us when you register on our site. Additionally, like most websites, our servers use log files to list requests made by users to the server.  We use log files to store information such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider, visited pages, date and time used and we also gather broad demographic information. This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.   

We also receive data through aggregating personal information received from websites and compilers of websites (data providers) where people have opted-in to receive third party offers through web sites or email. The data we receive is maintained in our database and may be shared with clients who use our data enhancement services. We mandate that any company that provides us with data certify that the data represents permissible email data that they are allowed to share with us and that we are allowed to use. If we become aware that the data is not in compliance, we will terminate our relationship with that company immediately and destroy that data.

## **The Use of Cookies**

A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by a Web site to your computer's hard drive. TowerData sends cookies when you visit our site or register for certain services. Accepting cookies does not give us access to your personal information, but we may use the cookies to identify your computer. If you turn off cookies, there may be some features of our site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly. Cookies tell us which pages on the site are visited, how often they are visited and when they are visited. Cookies do not collect personal information. We do not combine the information collected through cookies with other personal information to further identify users. We use cookies for analytic reasons (i.e. demographic and geographic information) and may use cookies to target advertising. This may result, for example, in ads for TowerData appearing on websites that you visit.     ** **

## **How We Use Information**

We keep all our customers, and our clients' customers, contact information private and, except as described in this Privacy Policy, never sell, rent or lease this information to others. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we never share the information collected at our website with any third parties. We only use personal information in a way that is fair and consistent with the reason the recipient supplied us with that information.

TowerData utilizes industry leading data security solutions and has implemented policies and procedures to ensure the physical and electronic security of data stored by TowerData.

We may disclose personal information received directly from you or from our data providers to third party contractors. This disclosure is made for the sole purpose of the third party contractors performing work for TowerData, such as sending our newsletter. These third party contractors are bound by confidentiality restrictions that, amongst other restrictions, only allow use of the information while those contractors are performing services for TowerData. We may also disclose personal information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our website.

## **You Can Control the Use of Your Information**

At any time, you have the right to choose not to receive offers from any of our clients. You can do this by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email you received.

As mentioned above, TowerData maintains a database used for the services we provide to our clients. When asked by clients to validate or enhance data that our clients have, we access that database. If you do not wish your data to be used as part of that database or if you do not want to receive any future emails from TowerData, contact us by sending an email to [privacy@towerdata.com](mailto:privacy@towerdata.com) [privacy@towerdata.com](mailto:privacy@towerdata.com) and letting us know you want to opt out of our enhancement database. Be sure to include your name and the email address you want us to remove so that we can correctly identify you in our database. ** **
