## **How We Gather Information**

TowerData is in the business of intermediating between consumers who wish to receive highly valuable promotions, goods and services and companies who offer those promotions, goods and services.

When you visit our website, [www.towerdata.com](https://web.archive.org/ "www.towerdata.com"), we collect the information you voluntarily give us when you register on our site.

This information is not linked to any personally identifiable information.   

We also receive data through aggregating personal information received from websites and compilers of websites (data providers) where people have opted-in to receive third party offers through web sites or email. The data we receive is maintained in our database and may be shared with clients who use our data enhancement services. We mandate that any company that provides us with data for enhancement services certify that the data represents permissible data that they are allowed to share with us and that we are allowed to use. If we become aware that the data is not in compliance, we will terminate our relationship with that company immediately and destroy that data.
