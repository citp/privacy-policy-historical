                       WHAT DOES TOWER FEDERAL CREDIT UNION
  FACTS                DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
  Why?                 Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law
                       gives consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires
                       us to tell you how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please
                       read this notice carefully to understand what we do.
  What?                The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or
                       service you have with us. This information can include:
                       ■ Social Security number and name
                       ■ Account balances and payment history
                       ■ Credit history and credit scores
  How?                 All financial companies need to share members’ personal information to run their
                       everyday business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can
                       share their members’ personal information; the reasons Tower Federal Credit Union
                       chooses to share; and whether you can limit this sharing.
