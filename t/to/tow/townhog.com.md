If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the Dotblu Sites, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Dotblu Sites. 

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. Any files that you share with friends may be redistributed by them through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. 

We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for nonmarketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Dotblu Site changes, TownHogs that need to be settled, TownHogs that settle that you have been playing, monthly newsletters, comments on your profile, messages sent to you from TownHog, and for customer service purposes). 

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain nonpersonally identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Dotblu Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends. 

We use cookies, clear GIFs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the dotblu Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) with other third party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We do share nonpersonally identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Dotblu Sites. We may release personally identifiable information and/or nonpersonally identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. 

Dotblu also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or nonpersonally identifiable information that Dotblu believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/tos), take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Dotblu, our Users or others. 

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Dotblu Sites, in which case Dotblu may not be able to provide certain services to you.

Dotblu allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Dotblu Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Dotblu Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

Dotblu does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Dotblu to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Dotblu Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Dotblu's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

Currently, Dotblu has relationships with the following third-party ad servers or ad networks:

**Google, inc.** \- <http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html>  
Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on dotblu.  
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to dotblu and other sites on the Internet.  
You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

Dotblu uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Dotblu and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Dotblu makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If Dotblu learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Dotblu may post a notice on the Dotblu Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should notify us via email.

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Dotblu does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or nonpersonally identifiable information on the Dotblu Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Dotblu Sites at any time or in any manner. If Dotblu learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Dotblu Sites without verified parental consent, then Dotblu will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

The Dotblu Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the Dotblu Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Dotblu Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/tos), you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.

In the event that Dotblu is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
