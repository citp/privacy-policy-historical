\- We use pages visited in the aggregate and individually to determine what pages are the most popular among our visitors. This information helps us provide recommendations as to what pages our visitors may find valuable.

\- We use sites addresses that referred you to our site in aggregate and individually to learn what sites have linked to us. This helps us determine where the majority of our traffic is coming from (search engines, directories, guides, partners, reviews, etc. ...).

\- We may use a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. In most cases, once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates.

This allows us to measure and report aggregate information to advertisers such as the number of people who see their ad (reach) and the number of times people see their ad (frequency). It also allows us to avoid delivering the same ad too many times. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept.  
  
**Sharing Of The Information This Site Collects:**  
  
We may share demographic information in the _aggregate_ with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use an outside payment processing companies to bill customers for all purchased services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

If we partner with another party to provide specific services and a user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.  
  
**Links to 3rd Party Sites:**  
  
Top10Links contains links to other web sites on the Internet. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.  
  
**Security of User Information:**  
  
Top10Links takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

If and when we or one of the payment processing companies we use asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.

While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. To learn more about SSL, click [here](http://www.ssl.com/).

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must reenter their password to regain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. 

Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information at our website, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/help.php).   
  
**Supplemental Information:**  
  
In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it may be necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

For example, to determine if our customers qualify for credit terms, we may use their name and social security number to request a credit report. Once we determine a user’s creditworthiness, this document is destroyed.

Or in order for Top10Links to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual’s preference, we may combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase from one of our partners, they collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users’ preferences.   
  
**Correct/Update/Delete Policy:**  
  
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire to use one of our services, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove any of your personal data you provided to us.

If instructions for doing this are not provided in the area of the site for which you need to correct, update or delete your information, you may email your corrections, updates or notice that you wish to discontinue use of one of our services though our [feedback](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/) form and we will make the requested changes.  
  
**Opt-Out Policy:**  
  
Many of our web site services ( newsletter, branding, advertising, rankings, etc.) involve the sending of occasional emails from us to you for various reasons ( for example to provide the requested service, account maintenance, site news, etc.).

If you do not wish to receive these emails you can immediately stop them by notifying us of your desire to no longer use one or more of our services.

Instructions for how to do this are usually provided on pages relevant to the web site service you wish to stop using. For example to unsubscribe from our newsletter simply enter your email address in the form at the following URL:

\- your email address  
\- the service you wish to be removed from

We do not knowingly collect online contact information from minors under age 18 without prior verifiable parental consent or direct parental notification of the nature and intended use of this information, which shall include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity.

Where prior verifiable parental consent is not obtained, online contact information shall only be used to directly respond to the child's request and shall not be used to re-contact the child for other purposes.

**Notification of Changes:**  
  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

Aggregate

When we state that we collect information in the aggregate, we mean for summary purposes only. For example, we collect referrer addresses "in the aggregate" to answer such questions as: "How many people from Yahoo visited our site last week?"

Most people that connect through a dial-up service, such as America Online, get a different IP Address each time they login.
