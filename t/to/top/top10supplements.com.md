* * *

> Other than Personally Identifiable comments on our posts, e-mail address or name you shared with us during subscribing, and information of our contributors and editors, we don't really store any data personally. Most of it is done through services we use like Google Analytics and Aweber.

Top10Supps.com will retain your Personal Information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

Top10Supps.com will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.

## Sharing your information

* * *

> We don't share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals without your consent. Honestly for the majority of our visitors, all we see is a Google Analytics statistic. Nothing directly personally identifiable.

Your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.

If you are located outside United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Information, to United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

> Basically this means that our servers are located within the United States.

### Some examples of personal data sharing

## Keeping your information secure

* * *

> The security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is guaranteed 100% secure in the long run.

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

As for our website we take precautionary security measures on the backend and frontend. We also utilize Sucuri Security. Their seal of trust is provided via Sucuri's Website AntiVirus product. The monitoring service being employed offers you peace of mind that a website is not infected. Basically they set a firewall to protect a site from attacks such:

  * Denial of Service (DoS)
  * Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  * Remote / Local File Inclusion (RFI/LFI)
  * SQL Injection (SQLi)
  * & other Software Vulnerabilities.



We also pay a pretty penny for a dedicated server with a top hosting company to ensure safety and speed.
