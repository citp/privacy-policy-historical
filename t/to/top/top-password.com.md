## Your Information Remains Private

Our policy is that we do not share customer information with anyone. We do not give it away, and we do not sell this information to any third party. If you entrust us with your information, we keep it from anyone else. Customer data is not made public for any reason. We use it only to communicate with customers. We do not use your information for any purpose outside the scope of communicating with you in the most efficient manner.

## Purchasing  
  
| Ordering our software is 100% safe! When you place an order, your credit card number and personal information is protected by encrypting it. Encryption scrambles your credit card number and personal information. It stays scrambled while traveling over the Net and remains scrambled even while it is verified and processed. Your credit card number is not kept or recorded by Top Password Software, Inc. or any of our affiliates - it is simply passed through to the credit card company to finalize the purchase.

## Software  
  
| The software we create and that is distributed on our site does not collect any personal information or send any information to our server.

## Server Log Files  
  
| We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the web site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
