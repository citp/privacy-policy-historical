<span class="newshead">Topica’s Privacy Policy</span>

	
<p>Topica is committed to protecting your privacy. We 
  want you to feel free to express yourself on the Topica 
  system, so we are committed to allowing you to feel 
  secure in an environment that puts you in control of 
  what you share with the rest of the community, and with 
  Topica. </p>
  
  
<p>Topica will never willfully disclose personally identifiable 
  information about its customers to any third party without 
  first receiving that customer’s permission, unless 
  necessary for legal reasons.</p>



<p>Topica Inc. is a licensee of the <a href="http://www.truste.org/watchdog.html" target="New" class="txtnavy">TRUSTe</a> 
  Privacy Program. This statement discloses the privacy 
  practices for Topica’s 
  Web site. TRUSTe 
  certifies the gathering and dissemination of information 
  on the website, not any services or software. When you 
  visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe 
  trustmark, you can expect to be notified of what personally 
  identifiable information of yours is collected; how 
  the information is used; with whom the information may 
  be shared; and how you can correct any inaccuracies 
  in the information. </p>
  
  
<p>Questions regarding this statement should be directed 
  to our <a href="/about/contact.html?mode=privacy" class="txtnavy">Privacy and Standards department</a>. 
  If Topica has not responded to your inquiry or your 
  inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you can 
  contact  <a href="http://www.truste.org/watchdog.html" target="New" class="txtnavy">TRUSTe</a>.</p>


<br>

<p><span class="H22">What information does Topica collect?</span><br>
  You don't need to provide any information in order to 
  browse the Topica directory, use the search functionality 
  to find an email newsletter or discussion group, or 
  view the archives of lists that the list publisher has 
  chosen to make public. A public list is one whose archives 
  are readable not only by subscribers, but by any visitor 
  to the Topica site – whether registered or not. 
  On all public lists viewable through the Topica Web 
  site, the email addresses of participants are partially 
  obscured so they are not obtainable by unauthorized 
  visitors. A private list is one whose archives are only 
  accessible to registered Topica users who are subscribed 
  to that list. On both public and private lists, subscribers 
  of any given list have access to one another's email 
  addresses. It is the list owner's choice as to whether 
  a list is public or private. </p>


<p>If you choose to start a list at Topica or subscribe 
  to one, we will ask you to register. During registration, 
  we ask you to provide the following information: name, 
  email address, zip code, birth date, gender and country. 
</p>



<p>If you choose to sign up for the Topica service, we 
  will ask you to provide the following information: name, 
  company name, email address, credit card type, credit 
  card number, credit card expiration date, name on card, 
  billing address, city, state, country, zip code and 
  phone number. </p>


<p>We will NOT disclose, sell or exchange your personally 
  identifiable information (name and email address) to 
  or with anyone, without your approval. The only circumstances 
  under which personally identifiable information about 
  Topica users will be shared in a manner inconsistent 
  to that stated above is if we believe disclosure is 
  reasonably necessary to: </p>


<ol>
  <li> comply with the law or legal process; </li>
  <li>protect or defend the rights or property of Topica 
	or others; </li>
  <li>enforce our Terms of Service; or </li>
  <li>respond to claims that the content of any communication 
	on the Topica system violates the rights of others.</li>
</ol>



<p><b>During registration, you can sign up for deals 
  and offers from Topica partners: third parties with 
  whom Topica has agreements. To activate third-party 
  subscriptions, Topica shares your registration information 
  with only those third parties whose offers you choose. 
  In any case where information is shared, you will see 
  a disclosure statement to that effect. In signing up 
  for offers with such disclosures, you give Topica permission 
  to share the relevant information with the indicated 
  third party</b>. </p>



<p>If you sign up for magazine offers, you will be asked 
  to provide a mailing address. Mailing address information 
  is shared with the magazine publisher and/or distributor 
  in order to fulfill your subscription request. </p>


<br>
<p><span class="H22">How does Topica use the information 
  collected?</span><br>
  We will aggregate user information and perform statistical 
  analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior 
  of our members and visitors, to measure overall demographics 
  and interests regarding specific areas of the Topica 
  domain and to analyze how and where to use our resources. 
  Topica shares general demographic and interest information 
  with third parties and sales prospects, but such aggregate 
  information is not personally identifiable. We also 
  use the aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors 
  as to the number of people who have seen and "clicked" 
  on their advertisement. In addition, Topica may compile 
  and disclose aggregate information about its users for 
  promotional or other purposes. For example, we might 
  want to disclose that a certain percentage of our users 
  are located within a particular geographic area or fall 
  within a particular age range. </p>


<br>
<p><span class="H22">Does Topica use cookies?</span><br>
  Topica uses both session cookies and persistent cookies 
  (for an explanation of cookies, please see <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/" target="_blank" class="txtnavy">http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/</a>). 
  Cookies help us determine how long users view particular 
  content, which particular content (e.g., advertising) 
  users view, which content or sites users link to, and 
  which Topica services members and visitors use.</p>


<p>Persistent cookies are used if you choose to enable 
  the auto-login feature. These cookies are randomly generated 
  and uniquely assigned to each user. They are not associated 
  with any personally identifiable information such as 
  name or password. </p>


<p>Session cookies help us keep track of when a person 
  is logged in. Once a user is logged in, session cookies 
  allow us to personalize information on our Web site 
  for them, as well as keep track of lists to which they 
  have subscription privileges.</p>


<br>
<p><span class="H22">How can I change or delete information 
  about me stored at Topica?</span><br>
  As a registered Topica user, you have easy access to 
  your information, along with the ability to change it. 
  And, you can always choose to unsubscribe from any list 
  you've signed up to at Topica. </p>


<p>To change personal information: Log in to your "My 
  Topica" account (<a href="http://lists.topica.com/my/" class="txtnavy">http:/lists.topica.com/my/</a>). 
  From the Preferences menu on the left, click the Password 
  and User Profile link. Make any changes you like to 
  your user profile, and save them when you are done. 
</p>


<p>To change your email address: Log in to your "My 
  Topica" account (<a href="http://lists.topica.com/my/" class="txtnavy">http:/lists.topica.com/my/</a>). 
  From the Preferences menu on the left, click the Email 
  Addresses link. Follow the instructions on the page 
  to change or delete your email address. </p>


<p>To terminate your Topica service: You may terminate 
  all of your Topica subscriptions and your "My Topica" 
  account by contacting our <a href="/about/contact.html?mode=privacy&amp;subject='Delete%20Account'" class="txtnavy">Customer Care</a> department. 
</p>


<br>
<p><span class="H22">How can I unsubscribe from email lists 
  at Topica?</span><br>
  There are three ways to unsubscribe from Topica lists. 
</p>


<ol>
  <li> Use the Easy Unsubscribe link that appears at the 
	bottom of every message you receive from a Topica 
	list. Clicking the link takes you to an unsubscribe 
	page at the Topica site, where you're asked to confirm 
	that you want to unsubscribe. Click the confirmation 
	link, and you are unsubscribed.</li>
  <li>Use your "My Topica" account to unsubscribe. 
	Log in to your "My 
    Topica" account (<a href="http://lists.topica.com/my/" class="txtnavy">http:/lists.topica.com/my/</a>).
	Look for the column called "Delivery Method," 
	located to the right of the names of the lists you 
	are subscribed to. Using the drop-down menu in the 
	"Delivery Method" column, highlight "Unsubscribe," 
	then go to the bottom of the page and click the "Save 
	Changes" button.</li>
  <li>Send an email message to [listname]-unsubscribe@topica.com, 
	where [listname] is replaced by the actual name of 
	the list. For instance, if you were subscribed to 
	a list called CarClub, you could remove yourself from 
	the list by sending a message to the following address: 
	CarClub-unsubscribe@topica.com</li>
</ol>


<br>
<p><span class="H22">How does Topica protect the privacy 
  of children?</span><br>
  As the Topica service is not intended for use by children 
  under the age of 13, there are certain safeguards in 
  place to prevent children from registering with our 
  service. However, as with any Web site, children can 
  access all parts of the site which are accessible to 
  the general public. See the "What information does 
  Topica collect?" section of this document for an 
  explanation of what information is publicly accessible 
  through the Topica site. </p>

  information in a manner different from that stated at 
  the time of collection, we will notify you via email. 
  You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your
