                                group, or view the archives of lists that the 
                                list publisher has chosen to make public. A public 
                                list is one whose archives are readable not only 
                                by subscribers, but by any visitor to the Topica 
                                site – whether registered or not. On all

                                the email addresses of participants are partially

                                are only accessible to registered Topica users 
                                who are subscribed to that list. On both public 
                                and private lists, subscribers of any given list 
                                have access to one another's email addresses. 
                                It is the list owner's choice as to whether a 
                                list is public or private. </p>

                                We will aggregate user information and perform 
                                statistical analyses of the collective characteristics 
                                and behavior of our members and visitors, to measure 
                                overall demographics and interests regarding specific 
                                areas of the Topica domain and to analyze how 
                                and where to use our resources. Topica shares 
                                general demographic and interest information with 
                                third parties and sales prospects, but such aggregate 
                                information is not personally identifiable. We 
                                also use the aggregate data collected to inform 
                                our sponsors as to the number of people who have 
                                seen and "clicked" on their advertisement. In 
                                addition, Topica may compile and disclose aggregate 
                                information about its users for promotional or 
                                other purposes. For example, we might want to 
                                disclose that a certain percentage of our users 
                                are located within a particular geographic area 
                                or fall within a particular age range. </p>

                                There are three ways to unsubscribe from Topica 
                                lists. </p> 
                              <ol> 
                                <li> Use the Easy Unsubscribe link that appears 
                                  at the bottom of every message you receive from 
                                  a Topica list. Clicking the link takes you to 
                                  an unsubscribe page at the Topica site, where 
                                  you're asked to confirm that you want to unsubscribe. 
                                  Click the confirmation link, and you are unsubscribed.<br> 
                                  <br> 
                                </li> 
                                <li> Use your "My Topica" account to 
                                  unsubscribe. Log in to your "My Topica" 
                                  account (<a href="http://lists.topica.com/my/">http:/lists.topica.com/my/</a>). 
                                  Look for the column called "Delivery Method," 
                                  located to the right of the names of the lists 
                                  you are subscribed to. Using the drop-down menu 
                                  in the "Delivery Method" column, highlight 
                                  "Unsubscribe," then go to the bottom 
                                  of the page and click the "Save Changes" 
                                  button.<br> 
                                  <br> 
                                </li> 
                                <li> Send an email message to [listname]-unsubscribe@topica.com, 
                                  where [listname] is replaced by the actual name 
                                  of the list. For instance, if you were subscribed 
                                  to a list called CarClub, you could remove yourself 
                                  from the list by sending a message to the following 
                                  address: <a href="mailto:CarClub-unsubscribe@topica.com">CarClub-unsubscribe@topica.com</a></li>
