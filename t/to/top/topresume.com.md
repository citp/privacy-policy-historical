### How we use your data

  * _Services._ Our Services are designed to make it simple and easy for you to acquire career development products (resumes and CVs LinkedIn accounts, interview preparation services, etc.) To make that possible, we store, use and transmit your data to internal staff and third-party service providers to enable us to register new customers, process payments and deliver our Services.

  * _Marketing._ We also use your data to provide you with information about goods or services we feel may interest you. If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (i.e. e-mail) with information about goods and services which are similar to those that have been promoted to you in the past. We will contact you by electronic means only if you have provided your consent for such communication. If you do not want us to use your data in this way, select the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any e-mail communication from us. 



### Sharing your data

We may share information as discussed below, but we won’t sell it to advertisers or third parties.

_Others working for Talent Inc._ Talent Inc. uses trusted third parties (i.e. IT services, analytics services, etc.) to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this privacy policy, and we’ll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions.

We do not disclose personal information to third parties for purposes that are materially different than what it was originally collected for. Should this change in the future, we will provide individuals with the option to opt-out.

We remain liable should a trusted third party to whom we’ve sent your information processes it in a manner inconsistent with this Policy, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

### Protecting your data

Stewardship of your personal data is critical to us and a responsibility we embrace. We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities.

We only process personal data where we have a legal basis for doing so. We review the personal data we hold on a regular basis to ensure it is being lawfully processed and that it is accurate, relevant, and up to date.

Before transferring personal data to any third party (e.g. suppliers, partners, customers, software solution providers, and back office support), we establish that there is a legal reason for making the transfer, which may include your consent.

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

We have implemented measures and procedures that adequately protect the privacy of individuals and ensure that data protection is integral to all processing activities. This includes implementing measures such as:

  * Data minimisation (e.g. not keeping data for longer than is necessary);
  * Pseudonymisation;
  * Anonymisation;
  * Cyber security; and
  * A data security policy.



### Your rights – individuals in the European Union

If you are an individual in the European Union, you have the right to access, correct, restrict, or erase your personal information stored on our platform at any time. You can also exercise any of these rights at any time by contacting us at [privacy@topcv.com.](mailto:privacy@topcv.com) Your rights include the following:

If we have given your personal data to any third parties, we will notify those third parties that the Company has received a request to rectify your personal data, unless doing so proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Those third parties should also rectify the personal data they hold - however, we are not in a position to audit those third parties to ensure that the rectification has occurred. 
  * _Erasing your data._ You have the right to ask us to rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data on our platform. If we have given your personal data to any third parties, we will notify those third parties that the Company has received a request to rectify your personal data, unless doing so proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Those third parties should also rectify the personal data they hold - however, we are not in a position to audit those third parties to ensure that the rectification has occurred. 



If we have given your personal data to any third parties, we will tell those third parties that the Company has received a request to erase your personal data, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Those third parties should also rectify the personal data they hold - however, the Company will not be in a position to audit those third parties to ensure that the rectification has occurred.

_Restricting the use of your data._ We only process your personal data where we have the legal basis for doing so. You have the right to ask us to suspend or otherwise restrict the processing of your personal data where:

  * You challenge the accuracy of the personal data;

  * We no longer need the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you want us to hold it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or
  * You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have legitimate grounds to use it.



If we have given the _personal data_ to any third parties, we will tell those third parties that we have received a request to restrict the use of your _personal data_ , unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Those third parties should also rectify the _personal data_ they hold - however, we will not be in a position to audit those third parties to ensure that the rectification has occurred.

However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

### Your rights - individuals outside the European Union

### Where we store and transfer your data

The EU and the United States. We have customers all over the world but to provide you with services, we store, use and transmit information only in the United States and the European Economic Area **(EEA)**.

In relation to personal data of individuals in the European Union, we may share your personal data within the Company. This may involve transferring your data outside the **EEA**. We may also share your data with trusted third parties who assist us in providing, improving, protecting and promoting our Services and this may also involve transferring your data outside the **EEA.** Whenever we transfer your personal data outside the **EEA,** we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * Where we transfer your data outside the EEA within the Company, your data will be transferred to the United States. The Company complies with the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the EEA. This means that we have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles which require us to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EEA and the US. To learn more about the Privacy Shield and to view our certification, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).
  * Where we transfer your data to third parties, we will transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission (for further details, see [Adequacy decisions of the European Commission)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en), or we will use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe (for further details, see [International data transfers using model contracts).](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en)



In compliance with the US-EU and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with questions or concerns about the use of their Personal Data should contact us at: [dpo@talentinc.com](mailto:dpo@talentinc.com)

If your question or concern cannot be satisfied through this process we are further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under US-EU Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield to an independent dispute resolution mechanism operated by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS).

If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by us, EU and Swiss individuals may bring a complaint before the JAM EU and Swiss Privacy Shield program can be found at: www.jamsadr.org. Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU and Swiss individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism. We are committed to cooperate with EU and Swiss data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland.

### Changes to our Company

If we are involved in a reorganisation, merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (e.g. via e-mail to the e-mail address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.

We may revise this privacy policy from time to time and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.
