**Topshop/Topman Limited** **Privacy Policy - What you need to know**

This is the Topshop/Topman Limited privacy policy to explain how and why we use your personal information. It’s important, so please read it and make sure you control your privacy. Our website and apps are not intended for use by children who are under 16 years of age. We know you are busy, so to help, our policy lets you chose how much you want to know: quick read, or detail.

**Our privacy principles**

We take your privacy seriously.

We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information.

We comply with data privacy laws when using your personal information.

We only use it for lawful reasons you expect or that we explain to you in this document.

We will limit our collection and use to details we really need or which you have provided.

We will explain your rights to control your personal information to you and how to use them.

**Quick read: Privacy Policy Summary**

We want you to understand:

  1. **What personal information we collect about you and where we get it from**
  2. **What we do with your personal information**
  3. **Who we share your personal information with and why**
  4. **Where we send your personal information outside Europe**

  7. **Your rights and how to use them**
  8. **Other details you should know**



**1\. What personal information we collect about you and where we get it from**

We collect most information directly from you when you order or buy from us. We get technical details from the devices you use to access our apps and websites and from cookies which tell us what you look at online, where and when. Like most other websites, our technology also lets us know when and how you use our websites, such as when you have added to or abandoned your basket or filled in a form.

The personal information we collect and use will depend on why we need it. We will only collect the personal information we believe we need to use, or which you have agreed we can collect from you or agreed someone else can share with us, such as Unidays to confirm student status.

Sometimes we are given information about you unexpectedly, such as from the police, organisations and agencies trying to prevent threats and fraud, and from the public.

**Clickhere to read more.**

**2\. What we do with your personal information**

We need to collect and use lots of information about you so that you can use our websites and apps, shop in our stores, buy things from us and learn about our offers and new arrivals. We also need to use some details to prevent and detect fraud.

We look at and learn from your browsing, shopping and how you respond to our marketing to understand what sort of customer you are and predict what products we have that you may also be interested in. We try to show you adverts and offers we think you will like tailored to you based on stuff like your location, including what we know about you including through our apps, websites and other websites you visit, relying on the extra understanding about you which ad providers and social media platforms have collected with your consent.

Our use of your details will depend on you and what you are doing: browsing or buying, if you are new to us or a registered customer. Use will be different on-line and in-store but we will try to join up details of our relationship with you in store and online in our records, even if you use different devices online. We explain our lawful reasons for use of your personal information in our detail section. You can access this by scrolling to “Additional Details”.

**Clickhere to read more.**

**3\. Who we share your personal information with and why**

We use suppliers and service providers, such as for delivering orders, or dealing with card checks and payments. These include other group companies and external contractors. We only share the personal details they need to know for their services and we make sure your privacy is respected and protected.

We share personal information with third parties when you have told us that we can share, or them that they can share, or you agree we can share your information, such as when you register to use a ‘Style adviser’ function we offer which is provided by a third party, or with third party ad providers, such as social media platforms or Google, so our adverts are shown to you.  We will share agreed details with third parties like Newday if you choose to use their store card, or Klarna if you choose to use their payment service, for the purpose of enabling the service which you have sought to use.

We will provide personal information about you to the police, fraud prevention and credit reference agencies when we have to by law, or when we deem necessary to prevent fraud.  If we decide to reorganise or sell all or most of our business, your personal information may be transferred to the buyer of the business but we will never sell your personal information to third parties for them to market their products to you.

**Clickhere to read more.**

**4\. Where we send your personal information outside Europe**

Business for us and many suppliers is international so your personal information may, at times, be handled in a location outside Europe. When this occurs, we take care in ensuring the security of your information. In the event you ask us to deliver your order outside of Europe, we need to send limited details outside of Europe to fulfil this request.

**Clickhere to read more.**

**5\. How do we keep your personal information secure**

Our people understand how important it is to keep your personal information safe and secure. We take steps  online and in store  to keep our stores and offices, systems and records secure.

**Clickhere to read more.**

**6\. How long we keep your information and why**

We will only keep your personal information for a limited period of time. This period will depend on a number of reasons, such whether we still need to deliver to you, or you have an account with us, or we are providing ongoing customer care to you. Sometimes we must also keep your information by law, to deal with a regulator or where required by our insurers. We delete your personal information at your request where possible and we won’t keep it for longer than we should or need to for the provision of a service and for communicating with you.

**Clickhere to read more.**

**7\. Your rights and how to use them**

You have rights to find out about how and why we use your personal information and to control its use. These include rights to access and correct your details, in some cases to ask us to limit or stop our use of them and even to delete them.  Where we use your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to change your mind and you can always unsubscribe from our direct marketing to you, by simply clicking unsubscribe in a marketing email, or in this policy.  

Your privacy matters, so we have appointed a Data Protection Officer and have a Data Protection Team to help. You can get in touch with our Customer Care team for help with data protection matters at [Customer.service@topman.com](mailto:Customer.service@topman.com). You also have a right to complain to the UK’s privacy regulator should you feel your rights or the law has been compromised.

They will provide us with details of your purchases for our records. Unusually, if you are involved in any suspected incident, they may share additional details with us to help us together to prevent and detect crime.

**Cookies**

So we are clear, cookies are the nickname for tiny text files which some websites pages place on the device you use to access them, to give us encrypted information such as to remember what you have put in your basket when shopping, your preferences, whether you have an account and what cookies you have accepted. They will not collect your name, address and payment card details but send back technical facts.  They also help us to understand and sort out technical errors which sometimes happen online. We need cookies to make our websites and your device able to work well together. Some cookies are our own but we also work with carefully selected third parties to help us and who set their cookies from our website pages and to help us run our websites (these are called third party cookies).  You will not be able to buy from us online and your browsing experience may not be as enjoyable if you block your device from receiving cookies.

We use cookies online to do the job a good sales assistant does in store, noting what you are interested in, seeing if we can help show you where those items are, find more like them and tell you about products which work well with them. We can also tell you about special offers and promotions, just like they would.

Personal information does not include information where your identity has been removed or is unknown (anonymous data).  Some of this information may only be identifiable to you and personal because you are logged in to your account, or because we have collected details of your IP address or the device that you have used to access the website. Where we can, we prefer to show you adverts online which you are more likely to be interested in.

Normally until you buy from us, you are an unnamed user of our website but we want to make you a customer. We work with online advertising partners to do this. They set a cookie from our webpages and this allows them to spot when you use the same device on other websites they publish ads on. They can then make sure you see an ad from us (retargeting). In some cases, the ads you see from us online will be more tailored to you (tailored or behavioural ads). This uses known and observed information about you to try and categorise you and predict what you will want to buy and which offers you will most like (profiling). This will be from our knowledge of you as a customer with us and from your use of our websites but we do not share that detailed information with those advertising partners. In other cases, it will be based on what advertising partners /social media providers know about you from their cookies and use of their websites but we do not receive the detailed information from these websites. 

You can get more information about cookies and can change your mind about cookies at any time. if you want more details or to change your mind, see our cookies policy.

**2\. What we do with your personal information**

We need to collect and use lots of information about you and any devices you use to access our apps or websites for many different reasons but we will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. This will always be for one of these reasons (our lawful basis):

**Legal basis**

| 

**When we use this basis**  
  
---|---  
  
Contract

| 

This is where we need to use your personal information for a contract reason (to comply with a contract with you, or take steps you have requested to start a contract with you).  
  
Legal obligation

| 

This is where we must use your personal information to comply with the law, or a binding request like a court order.  
  
Consent

| 

This is where we use your personal information with your clear consent, you have a complete free choice to say yes or no, and you can change your mind at any time.  
  
Public interest

| 

This is where we need to use your personal information for an official purpose, or for a reason in the public interest for the greater public good, like cooperating voluntarily with an official police investigation.  
  
Vital interests

| 

This is where we need to use your personal information in an emergency to protect you (or someone else) from death or serious harm.  
  
Legitimate interests

| 

This is where, on balance and being fair to you, we have (or a third party has) another good and lawful business reason for using your personal information and we do not need your consent.  
  
By law we must treat special category or sensitive personal data, such as on health or alleged crimes, with even more care and must have an additional reason for collecting and using this type of personal information. Where special categories of sensitive personal information are involved in addition our use will always be for one of these reasons.

**Legal basis**

| 

**When we use this basis**  
  
---|---  
  
Legal obligation

| 

This is where we must use your personal information to comply with your or our legal rights or obligations related to employment or social protection.  
  
Preventative medicine

| 

This is where we need to use your personal information for medical diagnosis or preventative health reasons  
  
Substantial public interest

| 

This is where we need to use your personal information in the substantial public interest for the greater public good.  
  
Explicit consent

| 

This is where we use your personal information with your very clear and express consent, you have a complete free choice to say yes or no, and you can change your mind at any time.  
  
Legal claims

| 

This is where we need to use your personal information to investigate, take advice on bring or defend legal claims.  
  
Vital interests

| 

This is where we need to use your personal information in an emergency to protect you (or someone else) from death or serious harm and you are not capable of giving your consent.  
  
We want you to understand why we use the personal information we do and our legal basis for doing so. We explain this here.

Where we can, we will also move from using your information in ‘individual picture’ form about you, to ‘big picture’ form as a member of a group but not as an individual. To do this, we can bunch lots of information on individuals together (aggregation), remove or change details that identify you to make that more difficult or impossible (de-identification, pseudonymisation and anonymization) and change information about people into information about numbers (statistics). This helps us to protect your privacy whilst having the information we need to run our business and comply with our obligations. We can use the details for research, statistical analysis, and reports.

**3\. Who we share your personal information with and why**

We do not sell your personal information to third parties for them to market their products to you but, on occasion, we do need to share some of your details with third parties.

We need to work with other group companies, suppliers and professional service providers as they help us to run our business and look after you. In these cases, we only share the personal details they need to know for their services and work closely with them to make sure your privacy is respected and protected. They must keep your details confidential and secure and only use them to provide the help we have agreed with them or as allowed by law.

We are a dynamic business in a fast moving industry and as you can imagine, the help we need can change quickly and over time. We work with lots of suppliers and service providers and these also frequently change. So that you understand where this can affect your personal information, we have provided more details.

  * As normal for companies, we also need to report up to our parent company and it will be involved with key decision making related to our business.

They must comply with their data privacy obligations, make their policies available to you and allow you to change your mind about their cookies and use of your information. We are not responsible for their use of your personal information or websites.

**4\. Where we send your personal information outside Europe**

Data privacy laws in the UK and across the countries in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, (the European Economic Area) are very similar.  We have called this area ‘Europe’ for ease. If it is necessary for us to transfer your personal information outside Europe we will only make that transfer if we use a method approved as privacy-safe by the data privacy regulators in Europe:, including:

\- the country to which the personal information is to be transferred has been approved by them; 

\- the recipient of the personal information is in the USA and has certified they will comply with the Privacy Shield rules to protect personal information, approved by them;

\- the recipient of the personal information is legally bound to protect your personal information under binding corporate rules approved by them;

\- we have made sure that there is a contract to protect your personal data with the recipient, using a template approved by them;

\- the transfer is needed for another reason approved by them, such as to make an international delivery at your request; or

\- where you explicitly consent to the transfer

You can ask for a copy of the method approved as privacy safe by the data privacy regulators in Europe from our Customer Care team or Data Protection Team using the contact details in section 8 below.

**5\. How do we keep your personal information secure**

We take specific steps required by data privacy law to take appropriate care of your personal information, whether online or not. This is to protect it against theft or other loss, being corrupted so we cannot use it properly or at all and to stop people who should not be able to see or use it from doing so.  

**6\. How long we keep your information and why**

We will only keep your personal information for a limited period of time. This will depend on a number of factors, including:

\- whether you have placed an order with us, or have a registered account with us;

\- any laws or regulations that we are required to follow;

\- whether we are dealing with a current request, customer care issue or complaint;

\- where there is a legal or other type of dispute involving or affecting you;

\- the type of information that we hold about you; and

\- whether we are asked by you or a regulatory authority to keep your personal data for a valid reason.

We will keep your personal information during the period that you are a customer with us and then for as long as is necessary in connection with both our and your legal rights and obligations. This may mean that we keep some types of personal information for longer than others. Generally, if you are an inactive customer we will remove your account after 18 months.

**7\. Your rights and how to use them**

You have rights to understand and control use of your personal information. These rights only apply to your own personal information. For all these rights:

  * we must be able to verify your identity;
  * your request must not impact the privacy rights of other people;
  * Your request must not be excessive, very unreasonable or repeated [too often].
  * They cannot clash with the provision of a service (for example submitting a right to erasure when we are processing an order from you)



Many rights have limitations and exceptions, for instance, we do not have to provide you with legally privileged advice involving your personal information.
