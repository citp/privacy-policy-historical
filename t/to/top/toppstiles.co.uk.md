For all other customers it is located here <https://www.toppstiles.co.uk/preferencesportal>.

As described above, as from the 25th May 2018, if we specifically request your permission to send (or you specifically ask us to send) you newsletters, marketing material or to notify you of special events, offers, promotions, competitions or new products and services by email, SMS, post or phone (as you indicate), we rely on your consent to do so. If you do not wish to receive communications from us, please inform us by using the unsubscribe link at the foot of the email by using the STOP code within the SMS, by using our preference portal <https://www.toppstiles.co.uk/preferencesportal> or by contacting us in store.
