A link to our Privacy Policy will be provided on the home page of our Web sites and is accessible at https://tophat.com/privacy-policy. All changes will take effect within 30 days of being posted on our home page or otherwise notified to users unless a shorter period of time is required in order to comply with applicable laws. You acknowledge and agree that your access of our Web sites and your use of our services following any posted changes to the Privacy Policy indicate your acceptance of such changes.

### Application of This Policy

We hope this Privacy Policy will answer your questions regarding how we treat personal information gathered from visitors to our Web sites and users of the THM Services.

Personal information does not include business contact information (for example, if you are an administrative user on behalf of an educational institution, your email address at the institution might not be deemed personal information). Personal information also does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about and through the use of our Web site and the THM Services and may include anonymized data which does not identify any individuals. Our privacy policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information or other types of non-personal information.
