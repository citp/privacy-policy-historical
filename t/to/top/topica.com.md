# Topica's Privacy Policy

Topica is committed to protecting your privacy. We want you to feel free to express yourself on the Topica system, so we are committed to allowing you to feel secure in an environment that puts you in control of what you share with the rest of the community, and with Topica. 

Topica will never willfully disclose personally identifiable information about its customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission, unless necessary for legal reasons. 

Topica Inc. is a licensee of the [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php) Privacy Program. This statement discloses the privacy practices for Topica.com. TRUSTe certifies the gathering and dissemination of information on the website, not any services or software. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified of what personally identifiable information of yours is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to our [Privacy and Standards department](mailto:privacy@get.topica.com). If Topica has not responded to your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you can contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php).

This policy effective as of July 13, 2006.

  
You don't need to provide any information in order to browse the Topica directory, use the search functionality to find an email newsletter or discussion group, or view the archives of lists that the list publisher has chosen to make public. A public list is one whose archives are readable not only by subscribers, but by any visitor to the Topica site – whether registered or not. On all public lists viewable through the Topica Web site, the email addresses of participants are partially obscured so they are not obtainable by unauthorized visitors. A private list is one whose archives are only accessible to registered Topica users who are subscribed to that list. On both public and private lists, subscribers of any given list have access to one another's email addresses. It is the list owner's choice as to whether a list is public or private. 

If you choose to start a list at Topica or subscribe to one, we will ask you to register. During registration, we ask you to provide the following information: name, email address, zip code, birth date, gender and country. 

If you choose to sign up for the Topica service, we will ask you to provide the following information: name, company name, email address, credit card type, credit card number, credit card expiration date, name on card, billing address, city, state, country, zip code and phone number. We use this information to provide the services you request, send you notifications about product updates, system events such as downtime, respond to customer support requests, etc. You can access and change your information by logging into your account and going to the "Admin" or "Account" pages. You will also be signed up for the Topica newsletter we send customers, which you can unsubscribe from at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" button at the bottom of the message. 

We will NOT disclose, sell or exchange your personally identifiable information (name and email address) to or with anyone, without your approval. The only circumstances under which personally identifiable information about Topica users will be shared in a manner inconsistent to that stated above is if we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to: 

  1. comply with the law or legal process;   

  2. protect or defend the rights or property of Topica or others;   

  3. enforce our Terms of Service; or   

  4. respond to claims that the content of any communication on the Topica system violates the rights of others.



During registration, you can sign up for deals and offers from Topica partners: third parties with whom Topica has agreements. To activate third-party subscriptions, Topica shares your registration information with only those third parties whose offers you choose. In any case where information is shared, you will see a disclosure statement to that effect. In signing up for offers with such disclosures, you give Topica permission to share the relevant information with the indicated third party. . 

If you sign up for magazine offers, you will be asked to provide a mailing address. Mailing address information is shared with the magazine publisher and/or distributor in order to fulfill your subscription request. 

  
We will aggregate user information and perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our members and visitors, to measure overall demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Topica domain and to analyze how and where to use our resources. Topica shares general demographic and interest information with third parties and sales prospects, but such aggregate information is not personally identifiable. We also use the aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors as to the number of people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement. In addition, Topica may compile and disclose aggregate information about its users for promotional or other purposes. For example, we might want to disclose that a certain percentage of our users are located within a particular geographic area or fall within a particular age range. 

  
Topica uses both session cookies and persistent cookies (for an explanation of cookies, please see <http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/>). Cookies help us determine how long users view particular content, which particular content (e.g., advertising) users view, which content or sites users link to, and which Topica services members and visitors use. 

Persistent cookies are used if you choose to enable the auto-login feature. These cookies are randomly generated and uniquely assigned to each user. They are not associated with any personally identifiable information such as name or password. 

Session cookies help us keep track of when a person is logged in. Once a user is logged in, session cookies allow us to personalize information on our Web site for them, as well as keep track of lists to which they have subscription privileges. 

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Free Discussion List site ([http://lists.topica.com](http://lists.topica.com/)). We have no access to, or control over, these cookies. 

  
As a registered Topica user, you have easy access to your information, along with the ability to change it. And, you can always choose to unsubscribe from any list you've signed up to at Topica. 

To change personal information: Log in to your "My Topica" account ([http:/lists.topica.com/my/](http://lists.topica.com/my/)). From the Preferences menu on the left, click the Password and User Profile link. Make any changes you like to your user profile, and save them when you are done. 

To change your email address: Log in to your "My Topica" account ([http:/lists.topica.com/my/](http://lists.topica.com/my/)). From the Preferences menu on the left, click the Email Addresses link. Follow the instructions on the page to change or delete your email address. 

To terminate your Topica service: You may terminate all of your Topica subscriptions and your "My Topica" account by contacting our [Customer Care](mailto:tepsupport@get.topica.com?subject=Delete%20Account) department. 

  
There are three ways to unsubscribe from Topica lists. 

  1. Use the Easy Unsubscribe link that appears at the bottom of every message you receive from a Topica list. Clicking the link takes you to an unsubscribe page at the Topica site, where you're asked to confirm that you want to unsubscribe. Click the confirmation link, and you are unsubscribed.
  2. Use your "My Topica" account to unsubscribe. Log in to your "My Topica" account ([http:/lists.topica.com/my/](http://lists.topica.com/my/)). Look for the column called "Delivery Method," located to the right of the names of the lists you are subscribed to. Using the drop-down menu in the "Delivery Method" column, highlight "Unsubscribe," then go to the bottom of the page and click the "Save Changes" button.
  3. Send an email message to [listname]-unsubscribe@topica.com, where [listname] is replaced by the actual name of the list. For instance, if you were subscribed to a list called CarClub, you could remove yourself from the list by sending a message to the following address: [CarClub-unsubscribe@topica.com](mailto:CarClub-unsubscribe@topica.com)
