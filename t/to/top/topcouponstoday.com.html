            <p>We serve some third-party ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

            <p>Trupath uses one or more companies to place advertisements for our products and services and those of third parties on our Site and third-party sites.  Cookies and other technologies such as Web beacons or tags are used to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to determine the display of content and advertising to you based on your interests both on our site, as well as on third-party sites where you may visit.  To support this interest based advertising solution, we, and companies who we have contracted with, may use anonymous information about your visits to our and other Web sites.

            <p><strong>Third party links and co-brand relationships</strong></p>
            <p>In order to provide increased value to our visitors, Trupath® may choose various third party websites to link to and from, and frame within, its own website. Trupath® may also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer information, programs and other services and features to its users. A “framed” website is a page from a third party’s website that appears within our website.  Framing allows you to interact with a third party website without navigating away from our website.</p>
            
            <p>These third party web sites may independently solicit and collect information from you. Trupath® does not control these linked sites.

On occasion, those third party web sites may provide us with information about your use of those sites.</p>

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. We encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. Continued access or use of the website shall constitute your express acceptance of any modifications to this Privacy Statement.</p>
