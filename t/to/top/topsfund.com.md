Finally, we use "cookies" to establish and maintain a logged-in connection while you are in the secure section(s) of our website.

We may monitor or record any telephone call we have with you. The content of the call may also be retained. We may inform you prior to proceeding with the call of this possibility. This is to establish a record of the information you provide, to ensure that your instructions are followed properly and to ensure customer service levels are maintained.
