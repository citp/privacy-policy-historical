		<p><strong>Privacy on top101news.com</strong></p>
<p>We at<strong> top101news.com</strong> respects the privacy of its users and off those who visits anonymously to the website. We want to let you know that how your personal data or information is being used by top101news.com.</p>
<p>If you are less than 18 years please get an adult or above 18 to help you to understand or ask us to explain it.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things we cover:</p>
<p>* Collecting information from you</p>
<p>* Using the information that we collect</p>
<p>* The ways you can access and change your information</p>
<p>* How we keep your information safe</p>
<p><strong>Information we receive and how it is used:</strong></p>
<p>We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>* <strong>Your information</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Your information is the information that’s required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.</p>
<p><strong>Registration information:</strong></p>
<p>When you sign up for top101news.com, you are required to provide information such as your name, email address, birthday, and gender. In some cases, you may be able to register using other information, like your telephone number.</p>
<p>User availing services on top101news.com via other social networking websites allows us to obtain information like (User’s Email ID, Contacts, Friends etc). By accessing our app and giving any information, user gives us permission to use information for business purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Information you choose to share:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Your information also includes the information you choose to share on top101news.com, such as when you post a Question, Bio, Status, Upload a photo, or Comment on a story.</p>
<p>It also includes the information you choose to share when you communicate with us, such as when you contact us using an email address, or when you take an action, such as when you follow friend, like a Movie Page, use our contact importers, or indicate you are in a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Information about friends, connections and contacts:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>You can choose to invite your friends to join top101news.com, so that you can stay in touch with them on the site. To make it easier to search and find friends and people you know on top101news.com, users may search for other members using first and last name, email address and location. If you want to invite your friends and contacts to become an top101news.com member, we will send an email or an SMS invitation from top101news.com in your name to your friends and contacts encouraging them to sign up to top101news.com.</p>
<p>If any of the people you’ve invited don’t register within a few days, top101news.com may occasionally send reminder emails or an SMS on your behalf to those individuals. You can choose to invite all your friends or only a select few by simply un-ticking the names of those friends you don’t want to invite. It’s up to you to ensure that your friends are happy to receive your top101news.com invite. Otherwise, the only information we hold about your friends and contacts is what you tell us through the site. So, again, think carefully about your posts!</p>
<p><strong>* Being Anonymous</strong></p>
<p>The fact that you can send messages without other people knowing who you are is part of what makes top101news.com unique and so much fun. It means that you can ask things that you might be too embarrassed or shy to say if anyone knew it was you. People are often bolder and more honest when they are anonymous, whether they’re asking a question anonymously, or answering a question where they don’t know who’s asked it.</p>
<p>The thing is though, that it also means that when you receive questions or comments, you may not know who they come from either!</p>
<p>Some people don’t like receiving things from people if they don’t know who they are. So every member can choose not to receive questions from anonymous users on the ‘Settings’ page.</p>
<p>We all know that some people might abuse the option to be anonymous by being mean or by saying horrible things because they know you don’t know who they are, but we will take steps to stop them from spoiling it for everyone else.</p>
<p>We may assist the Police or other law enforcement agencies with their requests to the extent required by law otherwise, will not tell anyone who you are if you want to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a member may ask us if we can tell them the IP address of someone who sent them an anonymous message. Unfortunately, we are not able to give out that information.</p>
