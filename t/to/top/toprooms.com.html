                            <p>The information collected by Us varies depending on the service You request from Us.

                        <li>
                            <p>The information that We collect may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for Us or for one of Our suppliers or contractors, in order to process or manage Booking transactions using the Booking Service.</p>
