# Privacy Policy - Top Documentary Films

This page discloses the information about how we and our partners gather and disseminate your data when you visit [https://topdocumentaryfilms.com](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/).

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form (name and email address), the visitor's IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available [here](https://automattic.com/privacy/). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. If you have left comments, you can [request](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/contact/) to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also [request](https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/contact/) that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

Additionally, when submitting your comment, you may opt-in to saving your name and email address in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for 72 hours after which they will automatically expire, meaning after 72 hours you'll need to manually fill your details again if you want to leave further comments.

2\. Ratings:

Documentaries on this site can be rated. When you rate a documentary this site will record your IP address and if possible your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Also, this site will place a recognizable cookie on your computer so you're unable to rate the same documentary multiple times. This data is not tied to any personally identifiable information of yours. 

We purge these logs every two years, meaning their retention on this site could be up to maximum of two years, depending on when you've performed a rating relative to our purge date. The next rating data purge will be performed on 5/25/2020.

\----------------------------------

The following are third-party services that we use on this website which may gather your data:

You can read [their privacy policy](https://formspree.io/static/PrivacyPolicy.pdf) (PDF file) about what information they retain.

We use third-party advertising networks ([Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense), [Amazon's Unified Ad Marketplace](https://aps.amazon.com/aps/unified-ad-marketplace/index.html) (UAM) and [Media.net](https://www.media.net/)) to serve ads when you visit our website. Our settings at AdSense are such that DO NOT allow collection, storage or use of any personal data for ad targeting of European Economic Area (EEA) visitors, meaning Google will show only non-personalized ads to our users in the EEA. UAM and Media.net ads are not displayed at all for EEA visitors.

Having said that, these ad networks will still place cookies on your computer to allow for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse.

We generally embed videos from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/home) and [Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/us). When watching a video on our website these websites may collect your information. Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

9\. Affiliate links:

We are a participant in the [Amazon Associates Program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/), an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.
