##  What personal information do we collect? 

In order to process a switch, we collect your name, address and may collect payment details and other details to process the switch. We also collect your email address and phone number. These details allow uSwitch.com and your new supplier to contact you about the switch and any other information which uSwitch believes may interest you.

You can opt-out of receiving information from us whenever you input personal data, or by sending an email to [help@uswitch.com](mailto:help@uswitch.com "Email help@uswitch.com").

##  How do we use your personal information? 

If you have requested to switch suppliers, we will use your personal information to process that switch. This will include passing your information to the new supplier. uSwitch.com may disclose and use personal information collected about you within its own organisation (including its representatives) for the purpose of internal business administration, analysis and marketing. uSwitch.com may also disclose personal information collected about you to third parties, for the purposes of completing any transaction you are undertaking with us, for providing any goods or services to you or for the purposes of associated administration or obtaining professional advice.

  
If you enter a contest or another promotion, we will use the data so that we can administer the contest and notify winners.

  
If you have requested to be kept informed of services that we offer, we will contact you with these details.

  
If during your visit to one of our insurance or energy calculators, you elected to continue by accepting the terms of our Privacy Policy, we may pass the details you submitted to our quote engine on to one of our representatives. By indicating that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy, you are agreeing to allow uSwitch to pass on your personal data to the relevant supplier. If necessary the supplier might contact you to discuss your insurance or energy quotes. Without clicking 'Continue' or 'Find Suppliers' you will be unable to complete the car insurance or energy quotation process. Our representatives or suppliers contact individuals by phone who started the car insurance or energy quote process but do not buy a policy or switch, in order to offer them competitive quotes or further assistance. They are only authorised to help you with this particular quote and only within a limited amount of time after you have used our service. They have agreed not to use your details for any other purpose.

  
If while comparing loans with us you provide us with your phone number, name, address and postcode, we may pass these details - and the information you have submitted on the site - on to one of our loans brokers. By entering this information you are agreeing for us to pass your personal data to our loans brokers and for them to contact you by phone or email to discuss your requirements. They will only contact you in relation to this enquiry for a limited time after you have used our service. They will not use your details for any other purpose.

By indicating you have read and understood this Privacy Policy you are agreeing for us to pass your personal data to one of these representatives and for them to contact you by phone or email to discuss your requirements and provide business energy quotations. Without clicking 'continue' you will be unable to complete the business energy web form process. The representatives will only contact you in relation to this enquiry for a limited time after you have used our service. They will not use your details for any other purpose.

  
If during your visit to the energy calculator you opted in for our marketing and told us the month of your home insurance renewal you will be called by one of our representatives in order to help you with your home insurance enquiry.  
We monitor traffic patterns and site usage. Under the Data Protection Act 1998 we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access.

  
For these purposes we may send your information internationally, including to countries outside the European Economic Association. Other countries offer differing levels of protection for personal information, not all of which will be as high as the levels of protection offered in the UK.
