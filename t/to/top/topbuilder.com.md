##### What information does Top Builder collect and how is it used?

Our sites collect information volunteered by you in several areas, including newsletter sign up pages, site registrations, and Web site surveys. The information we request for you to participate in these features may include personally identifiable information such as name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address, as well as "demographic" information such as your hobbies or personal preferences. We will tell you at the time we collect information whether the information requested is necessary for you to participate in a particular feature.

The information we collect is used to respond to your specific requests, to send you periodic information and special offers from **Top Builder** and our sponsors, to provide you with updates on **Top Builder** offerings and features, to provide you with product information from manufacturers in our database, to provide notice of changes to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, and to provide our sponsors with aggregate data about our users. The information you provide is also used to understand users' interests and behavior, and may be combined with information **Top Builder** may have from other online or offline sources.

**Top Builder** also uses cookies and other electronic information collection mechanisms to obtain information from you, such as your computer's IP address. IP addresses are collected for system administration purposes and for studying how people use our site and how we can improve it. **Top Builder** uses cookies to identify registered Web site users and to automatically give them access to "member only" content areas such as articles and reports, and to provide them with access to previously-stored information. **Top Builder** also uses cookies to estimate our audience size and usage patterns and to track the aggregate number of customer returns at our Web site. Finally, **Top Builder** uses cookies to help simplify the process of filling out certain forms on our Web sites that allow you to request information from manufactures in our catalog and/or our advertisers. You can choose whether or not you accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. However, certain parts of our Web sites may not work if you turn off cookies on your browser.

##### With whom does Top Builder share your information?

**Top Builder** shares your information with its affiliates and business partners, including agents such as third-party mail processing facilities. We may employ contractors to help with our operations. Some or all of these contractors may access the databases of user information. These contractors are and will be subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of all information they obtain through their relationship with **Top Builder**. In limited circumstances, **Top Builder** will also share information about its subscribers with third parties in whose products or services **Top Builder** believes you may be interested. When sharing your information with these third parties, **Top Builder** requires that the third parties follow practices substantially similar to those of **Top Builder** , and that your information not be further shared with any other third parties. **Top Builder** will also share your information if required by law to do so, to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights or property of **Top Builder**. Additionally, if part or some of our assets are purchased by a third party, **Top Builder** will share your information with the purchaser of all or part of our assets.

If you use our "tell a friend" service to e-mail one of our articles, reports or product descriptions to a friend or colleague, **Top Builder** will automatically send this person a one-time e-mail, attaching to the e-mail the content you wished for your friend to receive. Your e-mail address will appear on the "From" line of this e-mail, thereby disclosing this information to whoever opens and reads the e-mail. The e-mail address of you or your friend or colleague will not be stored in our databases based on this service.

**Top Builder** may provide users with the opportunity to request additional information from product manufacturers in our online directory or from our advertisers. If you specifically request information from a manufacturer or from one of our advertisers, your contact information will be given to that manufacturer or advertiser, to allow them to decide the best way to fulfill your request.
