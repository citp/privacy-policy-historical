This Policy applies to consumer users (individually referred to as “you”) of OpenTable’s websites, applications and other online services (collectively, our "Sites").

Other third parties, such as restaurants at which you make reservations through our Sites, issuers of Merchant Gift Cards (as this term is defined in the OpenTable Terms of Use) you purchase through our Sites, and social networks that you use in connection with our Sites, may also collect, use, and share information about you. This Policy does not cover such third parties or their services. For information about third-party privacy practices, please consult with them directly.

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Sites.

**HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION**

**Information Shared With Restaurants**

When you make a Restaurant reservation through our Sites, your information is provided to us and certain information is provided to the restaurants with whom you choose to reserve. In order to facilitate your reservation, certain information is provided to that restaurant, just as it would if you made a reservation by calling the restaurant, emailing the restaurant or using the restaurant’s website. If you provide a mobile phone number, restaurants may send you text messages regarding your reservation. Some restaurants also require you to provide credit or debit card account information to secure your reservation. When you make a restaurant reservation through our Sites, we may also share with the restaurants additional information such as information about your dining preferences and history, or information that we collect via Third-Party Platforms. You also have the option of indicating special preferences or providing comments about your reservation that OpenTable will pass on to that restaurant.

We may share with restaurants summary reports of feedback from diners. If you provide comments about a restaurant through our Sites, these comments may be shared with that restaurant. We will not tie your comments with other information that can identify you, but a restaurant may be able to tell who you are from your comments, particularly if you give your name in the comments or provide contact information such as an email address.

Information you choose to share with a restaurant when you make a reservation through our Sites may be used by the restaurant for its own purposes. OpenTable does not control the privacy practices of restaurants. Please contact the restaurant directly if you want to learn about their privacy practices.

**Information Shared With Gift Card Merchants**

If you purchase a Merchant Gift Card (or redeem an OpenTable Gift Card for a Merchant Gift Card) through our Sites, we notify the applicable issuer of the Merchant Gift Card and provide it with certain related information about your purchase or redemption, including your name, email address, and the amount of the Merchant Gift Card.

**Payment Card Information**

To use certain services on our Sites, such as to make reservations at certain restaurants; and to purchase OpenTable Gift Cards, Merchant Gift Cards, or other products or services, we may require credit or debit card account information. By submitting your credit or debit card account information through our Sites, you expressly consent to the sharing of your information with restaurants, third-party payment processors, and other third-party service providers to the extent necessary for these services and/or for the purpose of detecting fraud, and you further agree to the following terms.

·  When you use a credit or debit card to secure a reservation through our Sites, we provide your credit or debit card account information (including card number and expiration date, but excluding the CVV number) to our third-party payment service providers and the applicable restaurant.

·  If you purchase OpenTable Gift Cards or Merchant Gift Cards from us, we collect the credit or debit card account information from you. We share this information with our third-party payment service providers in order to process your payments. These third parties may also store your credit or debit card information, other than your CVV number, for your future use on our Sites. Your CVV number will not be stored and must be re-entered for each order.

·  For information about the security of your credit or debit card account information, see Section called “Security of Your Personal Information” below.

  **Information You Share Socially**

Our Sites may allow you to connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information publicly or with friends. Our Sites also allow you to connect with us on, share on, and use Third-Party Platforms, including those on which OpenTable has a presence.

Please be mindful of your own privacy needs and the privacy needs of others as you choose whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with others. OpenTable also does not control the privacy practices of Third-Party Platforms. Please contact those sites and services directly if you want to learn about their privacy practices.

**Sharing with Others**

We do not share your personal information with third parties other than as described above and as follows:

These third parties may view, edit or set their own cookies. We and our third party service providers, advertisers, and/or partners may also place web beacons for these third parties. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Policy.

**SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

OpenTable takes reasonable steps to help protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. When your credit or debit card account information is being transmitted to our Sites or through our Sites, it will be protected by encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

To be clear, OpenTable does not itself store your credit or debit card account information, and  **we do not have direct control over or responsibility for your credit or debit card account information**. Our contracts with third parties that receive your credit or debit card account information require them to keep it secure and confidential.

Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee that transmissions of your credit or debit card account information or personal information will always be secure or that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat the security measures taken by OpenTable or our third-party service providers.  **We assume no liability or responsibility for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorised third-party access, or other causes beyond our control.**  You play an important role in keeping your personal information secure. You should not share your user name, password, or other security information for your OpenTable account with anyone. If we receive instructions using your user name and password, we will consider that you have authorised the instructions.

**YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES**

You may opt out of receiving marketing and promotional messages from OpenTable by following the instructions in those messages. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional messages, such as messages about your accounts or our ongoing business relations. You may also send requests about your contact preferences, changes to your information including requests to opt-out of sharing your personal information with third parties to our contact information below.
