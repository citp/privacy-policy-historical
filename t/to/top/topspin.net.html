        that Topspin’s business partners share with Topspin. While this policy does not apply to the practices of third

        customers enables us to personalize and improve our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and
        profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Website. In connection with the Website, we
        may request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of Website, which allows users to
        identify each other. We collect the following types of information from our customers.</p>
    <p><strong>(3) WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO YOU PROVIDE TO US? </strong><br>We receive and store any information
        you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include,
        without limitation, your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, password, contact
        information, phone number, transactional information based on your activities on the Website, and media consumed
        on the Website including, but not limited to, media viewed, played, downloaded, uploaded, and shared. You can
        choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our
        special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for purposes such as responding to your requests
        for certain products and services, allowing you to interact with other users, customizing the advertising and
        content you see, and communicating with you about specials, sales offers, and new features.</p>
    <p><strong>(4) WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY? </strong><br>We receive and store certain
        types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. Topspin automatically receives and
        records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, the page
        you requested, and the media you have consumed (e.g., viewed, played, downloaded, uploaded, and shared).</p>
    <p>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to
        our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.
        This type of data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we
        can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use
        of information, (i) we may provide information to the content owners that relates to their fans (e.g., regarding
        which fans are consuming and sharing what pieces of media at what levels), and (ii) we may provide aggregate
        information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website (e.g., we share this type of
        statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so
        that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience).</p>
    <p>  When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information
        about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.

        view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the

        <li>“Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the
            Site.

        identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of
        certain features the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests, Forums,
        Fantasy or other subscription based services.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Newsletters and Site Emails</strong><br> We may offer free newsletters to share information with you
        about the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our business partners and advertisers and

        subscription by following the instructions provided on the Site or, in some instances, in the designated area of

        require registration. Your personally identifiable information may be used to contact you for winner
        notification, prize delivery confirmation or other related purposes. We may ask your permission to allow us to
        post publicly some of your information on the Site, such as on a winner's page, in the event you win a contest
        or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission.
        In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Site,
        and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or
        sweepstakes, we have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the

        you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether
        or not to disclose information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.</p>
    <p><strong>Forums</strong><br> If you use our bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Website, you should be
        aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other
        users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the
        personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. To request removal of your personal
        information from our blog or community forum, contact us at the email address listed below. In some cases, we
        may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do
        so and why.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br> Like other websites and web-based technologies, we use cookies to collect
        information about how people use Topspin. We use this information to make our application better. Cookies are
        alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive to enable our systems to recognize your
        browser and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people. Most browsers have an
        option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well
        as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new
        cookie in a variety of ways. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable
        you to take advantage of some of our Website’s most attractive features. </p>
    <p> Notwithstanding anything else herein, we may partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through
        their partners) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These cookies enable more customized ads,
        content or services to be provided to you. To trigger these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or hashed
        (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your email address to a Web advertising partner, who may place
        a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information is on, or is connected to, these cookies.</p>
    <p><strong>IP Addresses and Click-stream Data</strong><br> We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for
        purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors. An IP
        address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our
        computers identify your computer by its IP address. When you request Web pages from the Site, our computers log
        your IP address.</p>
    <p><strong>Click-stream data</strong> is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the
        Site. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request,
        the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When
        analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Site, what type of content is most popular, what
        type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Transaction Information </strong><br>If you order any information from our Site, buy any of our products
        or subscribe for any of the services offered on our Site, we will ask you to complete an order form that will
        request certain information from you, including financial information such as a credit card number and
        expiration date and general contact, billing and shipping information. We will use this information to complete
        the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you
        order, and to invoice you. Such information is collected and stored through encrypted means for your protection.

        "What About Cookies?" and "Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)" sections of this Privacy Policy. If you have any
        questions about how information is collected and used by our service providers, please contact us at

    <p><strong>(8) IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</strong><br>Your Topspin account Personal Information may
        be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your
        account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to
        your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
    <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to
        us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
        protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. If you enter sensitive information (such as credit
        card number and/or social security number, national ID, personal health information) on our registration or
        order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). This security also applies
        to sensitive information collected on our Widgets.</p>
    <p>The Website contains links to other sites, including the sites of the bands, musicians and other artists from
        which you purchase or use products or services through the Website. Topspin is not responsible for the privacy
        policies and/or practices on other sites (including the bands, musicians and other artists from which you
        purchase or use products or services through the Website). When linking to another site you should read the
        privacy policy stated on that site. This Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Website.</p>
    <p><strong>(9) WILL TOPSPIN SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</strong><br>Personal Information
        about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to
        other people or non-affiliated companies. We may share your Personal Information when we have your permission,
        and we may share your Personal Information under the following circumstances:</p>
    <p><strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control</strong>: We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work
        closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses sell items to you through the Website, for example,
        the bands, musicians and other artists from which you purchase or use products or services through the Website.
        In other situations, Topspin provides services, or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. Usually,
        you will be able to easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction. We will
        share Personal Information with that affiliated business.</p>
    <p><strong>Agents</strong>: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf relating to the
        services we provide. Examples of such information include, without limitation, fulfilling orders, delivering
        packages, sending postal mail and email, analyzing and gathering data, processing credit card information and
        providing customer service. By using our services, you consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the
        above purposes. Use by such service providers of personal information is governed by their privacy policies.</p>
    <p><strong>User Profiles</strong>: User profile information including users’ name, email address, contact
        information, and other information you provide ("User Submissions") may be displayed to artists to facilitate
        direct communication with artists and users. Topspin artists and their colleagues can see this third party
        personal information when they use their portal. User profiles may be created by combining your information with
        other sources of information such as information obtained from public databases. Email addresses are used to add
        new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Party Advertisers</strong>: Topspin may serve third-party ads on or through the Website. In that
        event, we may share certain information about you with such advertisers and/or with advertising networks so that
        advertisers can present you with offers that are relevant to you. See "What Choices Do I Have?" below for
        opt-out information.</p>
    <p><strong>Aggregated Information</strong>: We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal
        Information, non-personally identifying information and log data with third parties for industry analysis,
        demographic profiling, and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services. See "What Choices
        Do I Have?" below for opt-out information.</p>
    <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: If Topspin, or substantially all of its business or assets, was acquired, or
        in the unlikely event that Topspin goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one
        of the assets that is transferred or acquired by the successor or acquirer (or a third party through
        bankruptcy). You acknowledge that such transfers may occur in any of these circumstances, and that any acquirer
        or successor of Topspin may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Protection of Topspin and Others</strong>: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good
        faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other
        agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Topspin, our employees, our users, or others. This
        includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
        reduction.</p>
    <p><strong>With Your Consent</strong>: Except as set forth herein, you will be notified when your Personal
        Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
    <p>As we mentioned above, we use some third parties to help us provide you with our services. These third parties
        have their own privacy policies, which you can view through their respective websites. Some of these third
        parties add cookies to your browser; if you do not want them to do this, you can disable third party cookies in
        your browser’s settings.</p>
    <p>To help you identify what information is collected and how it is used, we prepared a list of some of these third
        parties for you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google </strong><br>Used for site analytics and to track the number of people visiting our site,

        by&nbsp;sending us an email to <a href="mailto:customersupport@topspinmedia.com">customersupport@topspinmedia.com</a>
        This list will change as our Website changes:</p>

        <li>Shipping Information<br><br></li>
        <li>Billing information<br><br></li>
        <li>E-mail subscriptions to artists<br><br></li>
        <li>Transaction history</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will retain your information for as long as we need to in order to provide you services. If you wish to
        request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please&nbsp;contact us at
        customersupport@topspinmeda.com . We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
    <p><strong>(11) WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE? </strong><br>You are able to add or update certain information on pages,
        such as those listed in the "What Personal Information Can I Access" section above. We will respond to your

        unrevised information in our records.</p>

    <p><strong>(12) HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE? </strong><br>Topspin provides a marketing tool via the Website to allow
        artists and their representatives to market and distribute their media directly to users of the Website through
        e-mail, phone/voicemail and other forms of communication. If you are a fan of Topspin and want to subscribe to
        our newsletter, you can do so by entering your email address on our Website. We often receive a confirmation

        marketing. If you do not want to receive communications from us or the artists who use Topspin’s platform,
        please click the unsubscribe link contained at the bottom of any email sent using Topspin’s service. Note
        however that you cannot unsubscribe from some administrative emails, such as order or shipment confirmations.
    </p>
    <p><strong>(13) CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION </strong><br>Some of our artist’s sites may be reasonably
        attractive to children. We do not intend to collect personal information from children under the age of 13, and
        if we find out we have collected this information, we will dispose of it immediately. Additionally, when our
        artists are aware that their music and other content may be reasonably attractive to children, we provide them
        with tools to ask for a user’s date of birth and prevent the collection of personal information from children
        under 13.</p>
    <p><strong>(14) HOW DO TOPSPIN WIDGETS WORK? </strong><br>Our Website and data collection devices include "Widgets,"
        which are interactive mini-programs that run on our artists’ sites to provide specific services from the artist
        (e.g. trading an email for a free song, purchasing an album, playing music, etc.). Personal information, such as
        your email address, may be collected through the Widget, which will subscribe you to an artist’s newsletter in
        exchange for a free song. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Topspin
        Widgets collect the same personal information that may be collected by the Website, as described above. Topspin
        is the data processor of the personal information collected through these Widgets when the Widgets are on an
        artist’s site. However, because the artists are actually the controllers of this data, you should also refer to
        their privacy policy. Data is used by Topspin and the respective artists only for the purpose it is intended
        for.</p>
    <p>Some of our Widgets have an "Email a friend" feature. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend
        about an artist, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. The Widget will automatically send your friend
        a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of
        sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>
    <p>Our Widgets also have a "share" feature. If you choose to use our share service to repost a Widget on another
        website, the third party website will request your login credentials (such as on Twitter or Facebook). The
        Widget will then automatically post the Widget on that website, which is governed by that third party website’s
        privacy policy.</p>
    <p><strong>(15) WHAT BEHAVORIAL TRACKING DATA DOES TOPSPIN COLLECT USING CLEAR GIFS (WEB BEACONS/WEB BUGS)?</strong><br> Topspin
        and companies providing services to or on behalf of Topspin (such as advertising partners, affiliates, and
        exchanges) use web beacons/page tags (1x1 pixels), to collect non-personally identifiable information about your
        activities when you visit the site. The data collected and tracked by the service is anonymous. Behavioral
        tracking information through web beacons does not collect, track, or require access to any personally
        identifiable information about any such visitors. This website uses web beacons to inform, optimize, and serve
        ads based on someone’s past visits to this website, or websites within advertising partners, affiliates, and/or
        exchanges. The data may include your location information associated with your IP address, web pages requested
        or viewed, date, time, domain and responses to advertisements. Information gleaned from your browser is
        automatically received and recorded.</p>
    <p>  Topspin and/or its service providers, affiliates, and exchanges collecting non-personally identifiable
        information may use this information to advertise to you. Topspin and companies providing services to or on
        behalf of Topspin (such as advertising partners, affiliates, and exchanges) may collect information about when
        your saw ads served to you and what ads you clicked on. Topspin and companies providing services to or on behalf
        of Topspin may also use and disclose non-personally identifiable data derived from our advertising campaigns for
        reporting purposes, for scheduling and optimization of content delivery and, of course, if they are required to
        do so by law.</p>
    <p><strong>(16) HOW TO OPT OUT OF CONSUMER BEHAVIORAL TRACKING </strong><br>You may opt out by following&nbsp;the
        consumer opt-out instructions&nbsp;on the National Advertising Initiative's website.
        <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/" target="_blank">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/</a></p>
    <p>Opting out lets you opt out of ads shown to you based on factors such as your interests and demographic details
        on your computer’s browser. Opting out does not do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stop ads altogether<br><br></li>
        <li>Disable other companies or exchanges interest-based ads<br><br></li>
        <li>Opt you out across multiple browsers or computers at once<br><br></li>
        <li>Keep you opted out after you clear your browser’s cookies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are interested in stopping ads altogether, we recommend using a web plug-in such
        as&nbsp;<a href="https://adblockplus.org" target="_blank">https://adblockplus.org</a> which works across multiple browsers and operating systems.</p>
    <p><strong>(17) ABOUT EU SAFE HARBOR AND US SWISS SAFE HARBOR FRAMEWORKS </strong><br>Topspin complies with the
        U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of
        Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member
        countries and Switzerland. Topspin has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of
        notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe
        Harbor program, and to view Topspin’s certification, please&nbsp;visit the U.S.-EU &amp; U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor

        addition, while TopSpin Media takes efforts to ensure the proper and appropriate use of TopSpin Media data
        provided by TopSpin Media to third party companies, promotional partners or vendors, the Releases are not liable
        for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your
        collected personal information by such third parties.</p>

        collection practices. Accordingly, we recommend that you consult this page frequently so that you are aware of
        our latest policy and/or any changes to this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;Your continued use of the Site shall constitute

        information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will send such person an
        email notifying him/her of such changes and giving him/her the option as to whether to allow us to use such
        information in such different manner.&nbsp; Without such consent, we will use personal information in accordance with
        the privacy policy under which it was collected.</p>
    <p>Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is
        used. If we make material changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an
        announcement on the homepage of our Website or sending you an email. Users are bound by any changes to the
