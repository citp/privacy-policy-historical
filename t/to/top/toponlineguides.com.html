				<p align="justify"><font size="2">We have created this privacy 
				statement in order to demonstrate our firm and continuing 
				commitment to the privacy of personal information provided by 
				those visiting and interacting with this web site. We hold the 
				privacy of your personal information in the highest regard. The 
				following discloses our information gathering and dissemination 
				practices for this website.<br>
				<br>
				We recognize the importance of protecting your privacy and our 
				policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we 
				collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide 
				to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using 
				our site. This policy will be continuously assessed against new 
				technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What Information Do We Collect?</b><br>
				<br>
				When you visit this web site you may provide us with two types 
				of information: personal information you knowingly choose to 
				disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site 
				use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and 
				others browse our Web site.<br>
				<br>
				<b>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide:</b><br>
				<br>
				<b>Registration Information</b><br>
				<br>
				When you register for any of our products, services or 
				newsletters you will provide us information about yourself.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Credit Card Information</b><br>
				<br>
				If you choose to avail of our services, you may need to give 
				personal information and authorization to obtain information 
				from various credit services. For example, you may need to 
				provide the following information:</font></p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font size="2">Name</font></p></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font size="2">Mailing address</font></p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font size="2">Email address</font></p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font size="2">Credit card number</font></p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font size="2">Name on credit card</font></p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font size="2">Credit card billing 
					address</font></p></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font size="2">Business and home phone 
					number</font></p></li>
				</ul>
				<p align="justify"><font size="2"><br>
				<b>Email Information</b><br>
				<br>
				If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain 
				the content of your email messages together with your email 
				address and our responses. We provide the same protections for 
				these electronic communications that we employ in the 
				maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.<br>
				<br>
				<b>2. Web Site Use Information</b><br>
				<br>
				Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a 
				standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, 
				"What Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect 
				information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered 
				through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and 
				time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, 
				and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web 
				site.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</b><br>
				<br>
				Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of 
				administering our business activities, providing the products 
				and services you requested, to process your payment, to monitor 
				the use of the service, our marketing and promotional efforts 
				and improve our content and service offerings, and customize our 
				site's content, layout, services and for other lawful purposes. 
				These uses improve our site and better tailor it to meet your 
				needs.<br>
				<br>
				Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an 
				aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business 
				information will not be shared with parties except as required 
				by law.<br>
				<br>
				Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to 
				notify you about important changes to our Website, new services, 
				and special offers we think you will find valuable. You may 
				notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers 
				by emailing us at the link provided on the newsletter.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What Are Cookies?</b><br>
				<br>
				A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an 
				anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that 
				site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this 
				file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for 
				cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser 
				if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your 
				privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the 
				cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you 
				by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. 
				However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may 
				alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If 
				you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible 
				that some areas of our site will not function as effectively 
				when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot retrieve any other 
				data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?<br>
				</b><br>
				As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to 
				differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use 
				cookies to prevent you from having to log in more than is 
				necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web 
				server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number 
				of people visiting our Web site and which parts of the site are 
				most popular. This helps us gather feedback to constantly 
				improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies do 
				not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we 
				do not intentionally store any personal information that your 
				browser provided to us in your cookies.<br>
				<br>
				<b>IP Addresses<br>
				</b><br>
				IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are 
				connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is 
				used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP 
				addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part 
				of demographic and profile data known as traffic data so that 
				data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Sharing and Selling Information</b><br>
				<br>
				We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that 
				uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or 
				personal details) with anyone except to the extent it is 
				necessary to process transactions or provide services that you 
				have requested.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</b><br>
				<br>
				You may request access to all your personally identifiable 
				information that we collect online and maintain in our database 
				by emailing us at the usual address.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</b><br>
				<br>
				We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in 
				other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law 
				requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. We may 
				also disclose account information when we have reason to believe 
				that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, 
				contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 
				violating our Terms of Service or to protect the safety of our 
				users and the Public.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</b><br>
				<br>
				We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites 
				linked to or from our Web site or the information or content 
				contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided 
				solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful 
				to the users of our Web site.<br>
				<br>
				Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website 
				to another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. 
				Your browsing and interaction on any other web site, including 
				web sites, which have a link on our Website, is subject to that 
				Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules 
				and policies before proceeding.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Your Consent</b><br>
				<br>
				By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of 
				your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
				We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time 
				with or without notice.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Our Commitment To Data Security:</b><br>
				<br>
				Please note that your information will be stored and processed 
				on our computers in the United States. The laws on holding 
				personal data in the United States may be less stringent than 
				the laws of your Country of residence or citizenship. To prevent 
				unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the 
				correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate 
				physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and 
				secure the information we collect online.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</b><br>
				<br>
				This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not 
				receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue 
				sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
				<br>
				From time-to-time our site requests information from users via 
				surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests 
				is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice 
				whether or not to disclose this information. Information 
				requested may include contact information (such as name and 
				shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip 
				code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the 
				winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for 
				purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of 
				this site.<br>
				<br>
				<b>A Special Note About Children</b><br>
				<br>
				Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and 
				we ask that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any 
				personal information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this 
				service only in conjunction with permission and guidance from 
				your parents or guardians.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</b><br>
				<br>
				In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its 
				assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part 
				of those assets, and may be part of those assets that are 
				transferred.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Policy Modifications</b><br>
				<br>
				We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when 
				changes are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who 
				have given us permission to do so. We will post any changes 
				here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be 
				assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we 
				will not use the personal information you have submitted to us 
				under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is materially 
				inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior 
				consent. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Hooshmand Moslemi, The Owner &amp; 
				Author Of TopOnlineGuides.com</font></p>
