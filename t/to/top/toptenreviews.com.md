# TopTenREVIEWS Privacy Policy

TopTenREVIEWS™ and its network of related review sites take your privacy seriously. Our privacy policy is designed to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of the information we collect. We encourage you to read our full privacy policy, below:

**Information Collected**  
TopTenREVIEWS does not collect any personally identifiable information about individuals, except when such information is voluntarily submitted by the user. 

In common with many websites, TopTenREVIEWS automatically logs certain non-personally identifiable information about visits to our websites. This information is used for system administration and for producing usage statistics.

We do collect email addresses from individuals that wish to take advantage of special promotional offers, but **we do not sell, rent or disclose collected email addresses to third parties.**

**Electronic Newsletters and Site Notification**  
As a service, we offer free, electronic newsletters and new site (or site update) notifications to our users. TopTenREVIEWS gathers the email addresses from users who voluntarily subscribe for these services. eMail addresses collected are used for newsletter and site notification purposes only. 

Newsletters and website notifications can be subscribed to at any time by accessing our Review Notification Signup, located on the TopTenREVIEWS homepage and any of our review sites.

Consumers may remove themselves from any mailing list by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter or website notification email.

**Cookies**  
As you browse TopTenREVIEWS sites, we place “cookies” on your hard drive to show which source (search engine and keywords, newsletter or site notification, pay-per-click ad and so on) you used to find our site. We also use cookies when you press the buy button to collect aggregate data for analysis. We do not use cookies to track single-user data. 

**Opt-Out Policy**  
TopTenREVIEWS gives users options to opt out wherever practical; such choices include: 

• Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters when registering for a site

• Opting not to receive review site notifications

**Unsubscribe Policy**  
Users may unsubscribe from any of our electronic newsletters or site notifications at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of each newsletter or notification. 

**Use of Collected Information**  
Collecting the information described above enables us to tailor our content to our readers’ needs. 

All personally identifiable information provided to TopTenREVIEWS is maintained by and accessible only to TopTenREVIEWS, unless stated otherwise in this privacy policy.

**Third Party Partners**  
TopTenREVIEWS has teamed up with reputable third party vendors in order to provide certain services to its online users. When leaving our website to view one of our partner websites, we encourage users to review the privacy statements of those websites as we cannot guarantee the privacy of users while visiting affiliate sites. TopTenREVIEWS may use third-party companies to serve ads or analyze behavior patterns when you visit our Web site. These companies may place or provide ads (such as banner ads) on this Web site that might also place cookies. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our Web site in order to help us improve our user experience and/or provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of providing these services or placing these ads, these third-party companies may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer and each of these companies uses this cookie information according to their own privacy and security policies. Our Website may also use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that are placed in a Web page, (sometimes referred to as "1x1 clear pixel," "Web beacon" or "clear GIF") in the pages of our Web site in order to gather additional statistical site usage information. 

If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>. Be advised that if you change computers or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser.

**Policy Changes**  
Occasional changes may be made to our privacy policy. Visitors to TopTenREVIEWS, or its network of related sites, are encouraged to check this document periodically to stay informed of current privacy guidelines. 

**Acceptance of Terms**  
By using the TopTenREVIEWS website, you signify your acceptance of this website privacy policy.  If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of any TopTenREVIEWS site following the posting of changes to these terms will indicate your acceptance of those changes.
