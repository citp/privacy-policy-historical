## Where We Store and protect Your Personal Data

We understand how important data security is to you and therefore take all appropriate steps to safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of the data we collect.

All areas of our website are protected with secure connections over “https” technology. Access to your personal data is password protected and we use secure server technology that implements Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to protect your sensitive data. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.

We give the option for you to store your card details safely using Sage Pays payment system for future transactions. We do this by generating an authorisation token number in a way that means none of our staff members can see your full card number. We never store your card details or security code.

Our systems are monitored constantly for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we are continually looking to identify ways to further strengthen security in line with new technological advances and best practices.

## Where your personal data may be processed

We store your data on secure servers in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, sometimes we will need to share your personal data with third parties and suppliers outside the European Economic Area (EEA); for example, when placing an international order we’ll need to transfer your personal data between countries to enable us to supply the goods or services you’ve requested. If we do this, our contracts stipulate the standards they must follow at all times and we have procedures in place to ensure your data receives the same protection as if it were being processed inside the EEA.

## Uses Made Of Your Information

We have set out in the following table all the ways in which we use your personal information. We will only use your information when the law allows us to, and the legal bases on which we rely upon to do so are also included in the table. In some instances, depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data, there may be more than one lawful ground for processing your information.
