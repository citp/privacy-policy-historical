# Privacy Policy

**Your Privacy is Very Important to Us**

At ToolGuyd, we recognize that the privacy of your personal information is of extreme importance. The following is information on the types of personal information that may be collected during your visit to toolguyd.com, and how we may use and safeguard that information.

Your information will not be shared in any way other than in the manner described below, and under absolutely no circumstances would it ever be sold to a third party.

**Email**

You are required to enter your email address when commenting to an entry or article – this is only done for anti-spam purposes. On rare occasion, ToolGuyd may chose to use this email address to respond to your comment or to contact you on an individual and case by case basis. The email address you enter in the comment form will never be added to any email list. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of submitting your real email address, feel free to make one up.

Should you send us an email directly or via our [contact us](https://toolguyd.com/contact-us) form, we use your email address to direct our reply.

If you subscribe to any of our email lists, your email address will be collected. Your email address will be shared with Google, since we use their Feedburner service to deliver emails to these lists. You may opt-out of such lists at any time.

**Comments**

In order to leave a comment, you are asked to enter your name, which will be displayed with your comment, and your email address, which is not shared and is only used if we need to contact you on a case by case basis such as to answer a question.

We do collect IP addresses when you leave a comment, but such information is not shared with any external party. This information is collected for three reasons – to prevent spam, to ensure that giveaways are fair and that readers don’t enter multiple times under different aliases, and to catch corporate shills that hype-up their brands’ products.

**Logs**

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in server log files. The information in the log files may include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and the pages you visited throughout our site. IP addresses may also be collected whenever a comment or email is submitted to us via the comment or contact form interface.

ToolGuyd uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.

**Notes:**

While we periodically review the privacy policies of all third parties that may collect information through ToolGuyd via advertisements or provided services, we are not responsible for their privacy policies or how they use the information that they collect.
