Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration

<ul><p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Like most 
web sites, TooStep uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. 
A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows 
TooStep to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using 
the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings 
do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like 
the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie 
and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.</font></p></ul>

<ul><p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">One type 
of cookie, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once youve 
logged in to your TooStep account. The next time you visit the TooStep 
web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an 
existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service. 
Additionally, if you log out of the TooStep site you will need to re-enter 
your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. 
Another type of cookie, called a "session" cookie, is used to identify 
a particular visit to the TooStep site. Session cookies expire after 
a short time or when you close your web browser.</font></p></ul>

the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer 
operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the 
name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends
