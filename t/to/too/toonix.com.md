PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy applies to [www.toonix.com](http://www.toonix.com/ "www.toonix.com") (“Toonix”) and [www.superstadia.com](http://www.superstadia.com/ "www.superstadia.com") (“SuperStadia”) (together and separately “the Toonix Sites”), two websites operated by Turner Broadcasting System Europe Limited (“Turner”, “we” or “us). This Privacy Policy explains how Turner, uses information it collects about you and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, any reference to “parent” shall include legal guardian.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The type and amount of information we collect depends on the information that you provide when you contact us via e-mail and /or when you register to play on the Toonix Sites. 

In order to play on the Toonix Sites and access all the features of the games, you need to register either on Toonix or on SuperStadia. If you are under sixteen (“child”) and wish to register, we will ask for your parent’s e-mail address so that we can obtain your parent’s permission to process your personal information. We do not knowingly collect names and e-mail addresses from anyone under sixteen without notifying their parents via e-mail and giving parents the option to consent to their child’s details being included in the applicable database. If you are older than sixteen you can provide your own email address and activate the account yourself.

To register with Toonix or SuperStadia, a child will need to provide a username, a password and a parental email address. We will keep this information on a temporary basis until we receive the child’s parent’s consent to the child becoming a fully active user of the Toonix Sites. During the period when parental consent is being requested the child account will be held in our database as a temporary user. If we do not receive the child’s parent’s consent we will delete the information provided by the child within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, and the child’s account will be closed down. 

In order to fully register a child as a Toonix or SuperStadia user, the child’s parent will need to provide, the child’s name, surname, gender and date of birth. The child’s parent may also provide the child’s email address if the parent has agreed to the child receiving Toonix newsletters.  
Registered users will be able to play both Toonix and SuperStadia using the same log-in credentials and avatar.

USE OF INFORMATION

Any information submitted will be used as described in this Privacy Policy.

We use the information collected to provide our services, respond to any queries, and ensure that we request and receive the correct consent from a child’s parents.

We use the parent’s email address provided at registration to send the parent a message that can be used to activate the child’s account on the Toonix Sites. In that initial message, parents are provided a link to this Privacy Policy and details about how their children can use the Toonix Sites, including the Terms of Use. Parents are required to provide their consent before their children's accounts can be activated. Parents’ email addresses are also used to communicate with parents about their children in relation to their activity on the Toonix Sites such as a forgotten password. 

Upon activation, the child’s details will be used to administer the account. The child’s email address, if provided, and with parent’s prior approval, will only be used to send him or her our Toonix newsletter. Users of the Toonix Sites will be identified only by their screen name and avatar. Date of birth, gender, name, surname and email address, if provided, will not be visible to other users. However, if a child invites a friend to join the virtual worlds of The Toonix Sites, his first name will be visible to the friend.

It is also possible for two or more registered users to become online "friends" and send each other pre-defined messages, send virtual gifts and visit each other’s worlds and virtual rooms. We only allow limited interaction and users’ personal details will not be accessible.

If you want to read more about how the Toonix Sites operate, we encourage you to read our [Parents Information Page](http://www.toonix.com/parents-page).

If the child no longer wishes to receive Toonix newsletter, he or she may opt-out of receiving them by clicking “unsubscribe” included in each newsletter.
