# Privacy

### Privacy policy

We, Toolstation Limited, are committed to protecting your privacy and we keep to the data-protection laws that apply in the United Kingdom. This privacy policy, together with our cookies policy, explains how we use any information we collect about you and forms part of our terms of business.

**This privacy policy applies to personal information about:**

  * visitors to our website;
  * customers who purchase goods or services or create an account with us; and
  * our suppliers.



**What is personal information?**

Personal information is any information relating a person who can be identified directly or indirectly, often by name, account number, location, an online identifier or other factors which are specific to their identity.

Personal information may include ‘special category data’ relating to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health, and criminal records and allegations.

As a rule, we do not collect special category data about visitors to our website or our customers or suppliers unless we identify suspected criminal activity such as fraudulent claims or the use of stolen payment card details. In this case, we will record details of the suspected criminal activity and may take appropriate action, including refusing to accept orders, make payments or give refunds. We may also report the incident to the relevant bank or payment card issuer or to the police or other appropriate authorities.

See below for details of how we may use your personal information.

#### How your information is accessed within the Travis Perkins Group

Toolstation is part of the Travis Perkins Group. We may share your information with other relevant members of the Group for administrative and analytical purposes. You will not receive marketing from other group companies unless you have agreed to that.

  


#### Marketing communications and keeping you informed

If you have ever bought, or enquired about, our products or services and if you agree, we may use the information we collect to let you know about other products and services you may be interested in. We may also use this information to keep you up to date about promotional offers and what is coming soon at Toolstation.

If you leave items in your shopping basket on our website without completing a purchase, we may send you an email to follow up and ask if you need any help with your order.

We review the products and services you buy and we also analyse your use of our website and the searches you make on this and other websites. We use this information to tailor the marketing you receive from us so it is as relevant as possible. This may include placing adverts on social-media and other third-party websites.

You can opt out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time. You can unsubscribe from emails by simply clicking on the ‘unsubscribe’ link which we add to the end of every email we send. You can opt out of receiving marketing which is tailored to suit your customer profile. You can also opt out of email, text, postal or telephone marketing via the ‘My account’ section of your online account or by emailing us at [info@toolstation.com](mailto:info@toolstation.com), calling us on [ 0808 100 7211 ](tel:+44808 100 7211) or visiting one of our branches. See [Your Rights](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/) for more details.

  


#### Call recording

We may record or monitor some phone calls, for example calls to our customer services teams:

  * for training and quality control purposes;
  * so we have evidence of conversations; or
  * to help prevent or to detect crime (for example, fraudulent claims). 

  


#### Legal reasons for processing your information

Some of the information we collect is provided by you voluntarily (and therefore with your permission), for example when you sign up to join a mailing list or make a query.

If you buy items from us, or if you supply products or services to us, most of the information we collect is necessary so that we can fulfil the contract between us.

The rest of the information we collect is for our legitimate business purposes, which include to:

  * keep in touch with current, past and potential customers;
  * provide online account management and related services;
  * gain an understanding of how our customers interact with us so we can provide the most relevant products and services;
  * monitor the use of our website and improve its facilities;
  * identify suspected criminal activity and take appropriate action;
  * manage our supply chain and our relationship with our suppliers; and
  * protect and defend our rights



When we collect personal information from you, we will tell you whether you have to provide the information (mandatory information), or whether you can choose not to provide it (voluntary information). On the website we use asterisks to mark mandatory information.

  


#### How long will we keep your information for

We will keep your personal information for as long as we need to for the legitimate business purposes described above.

If you are a visitor to the website, we will keep your information for a limited period to respond to your query, provide you with the information you need or send you updates on our products and services, for as long as you indicate that you are happy for us to do so.

For all purchases we normally keep records of the transaction for six years. This is for accounting and tax purposes and to manage any issues relating to a fault or damage caused by a product.

We make keep your information for longer than this if there are valid legal reason for us to do so, for example if we must do so by law or under a court order, or if we need the information to defend or pursue legal claims.

  


#### Working with service providers

Like most organisations, we ask service providers to run our website and IT systems, to help us manage accounts, to carry out credit checks and to help prevent fraud, and to handle postal and email marketing campaigns. We also work with a large number of suppliers who provide products and delivery services to us.

We will only give these companies with the information they need to deliver the service we have asked them to provide and they must not use that information for any other purpose. Whenever we share personal information about our customers or visitors to our website with our service providers, we will put in place contracts which mean the service provider must protect the information and keep it secure. See also **Transferring information to other countries** below.

  


#### Other people and organisations we may share the information with

We may share your personal information with the following third parties for the purposes described above: 

  * Tax, customs and excise authorities
  * Regulators, courts and the police
  * Fraud-screening agencies
  * Central and local government
  * Insurance companies
  * Other professional advisors



We may also share your personal information if we believe this necessary to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or to protect and defend our rights, property or the safety of our customers and other users of the website.

We may reveal and/or transfer your personal information to others in connection with a reorganisation of all or part of our business, if the majority of our shares are bought by another company or if we transfer all or some of our assets to another company.

  


#### Transferring information outside the EEA

Most of the companies who provide services to us are based inside the EEA (European Economic Area). But there are some that are located outside the EEA and as a result, your personal information may be transferred outside the EEA. We will make sure that those service providers keep to any legal requirements that apply to the transferring of personal information outside the EEA, including, where appropriate, asking the service provider to sign the approved European Commission standard contractual clauses for transferring personal information to other countries.

  


#### How we protect your information

We must protect the information you provide to us. We use appropriate measures to protect the information that you give to us through our website and the information we collect and store about our customers.

All of the forms which gather or display personal information on our site are protected by a mechanism called SSL (Secure Socket Layer). This is a standard technology which provides a secure connection between internet browsers and websites, allowing you to transmit private data online. Firewalls are used to block unauthorised access to our servers, which are themselves based in a secure location. Within our organisation, we restrict access to personal information. Only employees who need the information to do their jobs have access to it.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via our website. However, once we have received your information, we will take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorised use, access or modification.

If you have created an account or registered to use any online services, your account details may be password protected. It is your responsibility to keep your password confidential and to sign out once you have finished browsing.

  


#### Changes to our privacy policy

We regularly review our privacy policy and if we make any changes to it we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. This policy was last updated in **May 2018**. If you have any questions or comments about our privacy policy, please contact us using the details at the bottom of this page.

  


#### Links to other websites

On our website links may be provided on our website to other websites that we do not manage. If you use these links, you will leave our website. We are not responsible for the contents of any third party website, and those websites will have their own privacy policies which you should read carefully.

  


#### Your rights
