# Privacy - Toolstation

### Privacy policy

We, Toolstation Limited, manage this website. We are committed to protecting your privacy and we keep to the data-protection laws that apply in the United Kingdom. This privacy policy, together with our [cookies policy](http://www.toolstation.com/messages/cookies), explains how we use any information we collect about you and forms part of our [terms of business](http://www.toolstation.com/messages/terms). 

#### Information we collect from you and how we use it

We will collect information about you when you open an account, register with this website, place an order for products or services, ask us for more information or contact your local branch. The type of information we may collect includes your name, postal address, job title, email address and phone number so that we can contact you if we need to. When you enter a competition or promotional feature, we may also ask for your name, postal address, email address and phone number so we can run the competition and contact the winners. We may also collect information about how you use this website using [cookie](http://www.toolstation.com/messages/cookies)s (Cookies are codes, made up of letters and numbers, which most internet sites will ask your computer to store to allow the site to distinguish you from other users.) Separate terms and conditions may apply when you open an account or if you decide to take part in a competition, so please make sure that you read these at the relevant time. 

#### How we use the information we collect about you

We may use the information you provide: 

  * to process your order or manage your account (if this applies);
  * to contact you to ask for your views on our services;
  * to tell you about important changes or developments to our site or services;
  * to provide a more personalised online experience;
  * to provide tailored communications;
  * to help us to keep accurate records;
  * to keep you informed about the products and services that we offer
  * for market research purposes, to publish details of trends (for example, to show that an increasing number of people are looking at our website from a mobile device, or that there might be a tendency for people to visit the website early in the day, before returning later to complete their order) and to help us improve the content of our website to make it more useful. (We will remove any details that could identify you from the information we use for this purpose.)



We only keep your information for a limited period so that we can respond to your query, provide you with the information you need or send you updates on our products and services for as long as you tell us you are happy for us to do so. However, by law, we need to keep some records for a longer period of time. 

#### Email communications and keeping you informed

If you have ever bought, or enquired about, our products or services, we may use the information we collect to let you know about other products and services you may be interested in. We may also use this information to keep you up to date about promotional offers and what is coming soon at Toolstation. If the email address you have given us is a corporate email address, we may contact you at any time to let you know about our products and services. You can unsubscribe from these emails by simply clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link which we add to the end of every email we send. Please note that this statement only applies to customers who have selected to receive our newsletter. 

#### Giving your information to others

We never make your personal details available to other companies for marketing purposes. However, we may ask other companies to provide services to you on our behalf. These services may include answering your questions about products or services, sending emails and mail by post, and analysing data. We will only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service we have asked them to provide, and they must not use the information for any other purpose. We may have to reveal your information by law or because a court, the police or other law-enforcement agency has asked us for it. If a majority of our shares are bought by another company or we transfer a substantial amount of our assets to another company, we will give your personal information to that purchaser. 

#### How we protect your information

We take protecting your information seriously and have appropriate physical and technological security measures in place to keep it safe. All of the forms which gather or display personal information on our site are protected by a mechanism called Secure Socket Location (SSL). This is a standard technology which provides a secure connection between internet browsers and websites, allowing you to transmit private data online. Firewalls are used to block unauthorised access to our servers, which are themselves located in a secure location. Within our organisation, we restrict access to personal information. Only employees who need the information in order to do their jobs have access to it. We never transfer your information outside of the EEA. 

#### Changes to our privacy policy

We regularly review our privacy policy and if we make any changes to it we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. This policy was last updated in  October 2015. If you have any questions or comments about our privacy policy, please contact us using the details at the bottom of this page.
