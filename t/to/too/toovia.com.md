# Privacy Policy | TOOVIA

Welcome to [TOOVIA.com](https://web.archive.org/) ("TOOVIA", "we", "us", or "our"). TOOVIA provides an easy and fun way for you to plan and coordinate your trips – whether it is personal or a group. Simply register, logon, and drag & drop the hotels, tours, and any other TOOVIA offerings that you like, and customize a trip that your family, friends, or colleagues can simply sign on and join … voilà! Your customized group trip is ready – no hassle, no fuss! 

This is our Privacy Policy explaining how and what we and some of the companies we work with do in collecting, using, sharing, and protecting information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with TOOVIA services (collectively, the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information. 

By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to make bookings, post content, including photos, comments, and other materials ("User Content" or “Your Content”), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-services). 

However, you do control how you want to share and distribute your User Content by adjusting your privacy settings in your TOOVIA Profile. You can control how you share information with those third- party applications and websites through your Profile Settings. We will not share your information with advertisers without your consent. We allow advertisers to select characteristics of users they want to show their advertisements to and we use the information users share with us to serve those advertisements. 

Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users"). 

> 1\. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM USERS

We collect the following types of information. 

  * Your username, password, and e-mail address when you register for a TOOVIA account.
  * Profile information that you provide for your TOOVIA Profile (e.g.: first and last name, picture, phone number, and other personal information you want to provide). This information helps you or others “find” you on TOOVIA.
  * User Content (e.g.: bookings, trip planner, photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
  * We may also request information about your hotel room preferences, frequent flyer membership, and car rental program information. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register; book travel; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on TOOVIA.
  * Communications between you and TOOVIA. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g.: account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical, and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. However, you may opt-out of communications from advertisers.


  * If you choose, you can use our “Invite Friends” features to locate other people with TOOVIA accounts either through (i) your contacts list, (ii) third-party social media sites or (iii) through a search of names on TOOVIA.
  * If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then TOOVIA will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using TOOVIA.
  * If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.
  * If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on TOOVIA then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.



**Note about Travel Companion Information:** Our Partners may allow you to make reservations for someone else. Please visit their respective privacy policies and their Terms and Conditions before making any bookings for another. Please also make sure to obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing TOOVIA or our Partners with their personal information and travel preferences. 

  * We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners, and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and demographic information.
  * If you sign up for TOOVIA using your social media account, link your TOOVIA account to your social media account, or use certain other TOOVIA social media features, we may access information about you via that social media provider in accordance with the provider's policies. The information may include your name, email address, profile picture, gender, list of friends, and other information that you authorize us to receive. Depending on the privacy settings of you and your friends, we may access information that you provide to a social media provider regarding your respective locations ("Location Data") to provide you with relevant content. Please note that your Location Data may also be shared with your friends on a social media provider in accordance with your privacy settings for that social media provider.


  * We use analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.


  * Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your TOOVIA account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other TOOVIA settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit TOOVIA.


  * Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e.: visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
  * In using our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.


  * When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by TOOVIA.
  * A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.


  * Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
  * Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g.: to mark keywords when you post a photo or check-in), geotag (e.g.: to mark your location to a photo or check-in), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using other's APIs, then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g.: through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.

But these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about your privacy through your TOOVIA Profile.
  * We may share your information with suppliers, such as hotel, airline, car rental, tours, and activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout TOOVIA, all services provided by a third- party supplier are indicated. We do not share your email address with these suppliers unless they need it to fulfill the travel reservation you have made on TOOVIA, and we restrict their use of this information to that purpose. All payment information submitted through TOOVIA to suppliers will not be stored in TOOVIA and such payment information will be transmitted via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). Please note that we do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your non-payment related personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through TOOVIA.

Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
  * If you were referred to TOOVIA from another site (e.g.: through a link you clicked on another site that directed you to TOOVIA), we may share some information about you with that referring website. We have not placed limitations on the referring websites use of your personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you to TOOVIA.

  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
  * We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.



Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information. 

Parties with whom you may choose to share your User Content:

  * Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set.

You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.



Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:
