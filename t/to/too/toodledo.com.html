<br><p>This site logs the IP addresses and types of browser used by its guests. This information is used to monitor and make improvements to the site.

Users may remove themselves and their information from the web site's database by <a href="contact.php">contacting us</a>.  This website and the advertisers on this website conform to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</a></p>

<br><b>Cookies</b>

<br><p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive.  This site uses cookies to maintain state between pages on this site.  The user may remove these cookies at any time by logging out of the web site.</p>



<br><b>Log Files</b>

<br><p>We use IP addresses and browser type to analyze trends and administer the site.  We do not do reverse DNS lookups, so IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>


<br><b>Surveys and Contests</b>

<br><p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>
