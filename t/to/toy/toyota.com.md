1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Information You Provide to Us

You can visit the Sites to read and learn about our products, without telling us who you are and without revealing any personally identifiable information. However, to use certain features or to participate in any special programs, you may need to provide certain personal information.

The Sites may ask you to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, or home address ("Personal Information")). For example, Toyota may collect Personal Information when you register on the Sites, request information, submit comments or participate in sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, promotions, blogs and chats, and surveys ("Programs") or other feature of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us. The Sites may also ask you to provide other information about yourself, such as demographic information (gender, ZIP Code, age, etc.) or certain information about your preferences and interests. If we combine demographic or other information we collect about you with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. If you do not want your Personal Information collected, please do not submit it.

Blogs and Public Areas: Please remember that blogs are public areas on the Sites and chat rooms may be public areas on the Sites. Any information posted in these areas can be viewed by other visitors or Internet users. You should not upload or post Personal Information in these public areas. Toyota is not responsible or liable in any way for the Personal Information posted to or transmitted through these public areas.

Friend to Friend: Some features on the Sites may permit you to submit information about other people. For example, if you wish to invite your friends to participate in a Program offered on the Sites or forward particular content from the Sites to your friends, you will be asked to submit your friends' e-mail addresses. Our use, sharing and protection of the other person's information will also be subject to the terms of the Program and this Privacy Policy.

Information We Collect Automatically

Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites, Toyota, as well as any third-party publishers or Web sites and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used (" **Usage Information** "). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views. This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Sites, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. This information helps us keep our Web site fresh and interesting to our visitors and tailor content to a visitor's interests. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Toyota associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Toyota treats it as Personal Information.

Toyota also automatically collects your IP address or other unique identifier (" **Device Identifier** ") for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, " **Device** ") you use to access the Sites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a Web site or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.

The tracking technologies used on the Sites to collect Usage Information, including Device Identifiers, may include, without limitation:

_Cookies_. Cookies are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites. Toyota, or our third-party advertising service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to tailor our communications with you, facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Sites. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Sites and pages visited. Cookies and other tracking technologies allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Sites; and determine the correlation between Toyota purchasers and the sites they visit. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; or set your browser to automatically not accept any cookies. However, please be aware that some features and services on our Sites may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Toyota account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.

_Pixel tags_. A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a Web beacon, clear GIFs or tracking beacon, placed on a Web page or in an e-mail, which indicates that a page or e-mail has been viewed. In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server. In order to ensure the safekeeping of your information, network advertising companies and publishers are not permitted to directly collect Personal Information on our Sites.

2\. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Toyota uses the information we collect about and from you for a variety of business purposes, including for example, to: respond to your questions and requests such as requests for product information, new vehicle information alerts, and brochures; advise you of important safety-related information; enable you to participate in promotional activities, or other Programs; provide you with access to certain services, areas and features of the Sites; verify your identity; communicate with you about your account and activities on the Sites and, in our discretion, changes to any Toyota policy; tailor content, advertisements and offers we serve you; improve the Sites; process applications and transactions; for internal business purposes; and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information or otherwise with your consent.

3\. SHARING OF INFORMATION

Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide any of your Personal Information to any third parties without your specific consent. We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information, and Usage Information with third parties. We may also share your information as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy Policy and in the following circumstances:

**Third Parties Providing Services On Our Behalf.** In order to carry out your requests, to make various features, services and materials available to you through the Sites, and to respond to your inquiries, we may share your Personal Information, or Usage Information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals that: host or operate our Sites; analyze data; provide customer service; sponsors or other third parties that participate in or administer our Programs or provide marketing assistance.

**Program Partners.** If you choose to participate in a Program, your Personal Information may also be shared with our Program partners and may be used by our Program partners if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that company. If you elect to receive communications from our business partner, your information will be used by that company in accordance with its policies, and this Privacy Policy will not apply to that company's use of your information. Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the Personal Information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program. If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Policy, those applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us with any Personal Information.

**Your Agreement To Have Your Personal Information Shared.** While on our Sites, you may have the opportunity to opt-in to receive information and/or marketing offers from someone else or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party. If you agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to the third party and the Personal Information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party.

**Business Transfers.** Your Personal Information may also be used by us or shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates and other entities in the family of companies controlled by or under common control with Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. for internal reasons, primarily for business and operational purposes. We may also share your information with our authorized dealers, dealer advertising associations and distributors for their own use. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, or assets related to the Sites, Personal Information, Usage Information, and any other information that we have collected about the users of the Sites may be disclosed to such entity as part of the due diligence process and will be transferred to such entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.

**Legal Disclosure.** Toyota may transfer and disclose information, including your Personal Information, Usage Information and Device Identifier, (including IP address), to third parties to comply with a legal obligation; when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/help/legal.html) or other applicable policies; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of the Sites, Toyota, third parties, visitors to our Sites or the public, as determined by us in our sole discretion.

**Surveys:** We may ask you to provide certain demographic information (such as your gender and zip code) when we conduct surveys on the Sites. We may use the information that you submit, including your responses to the survey questions, for the purposes identified to you prior to your participation in the survey. In some cases, we may publish the results of the survey, but will do so only as aggregate information and you will not be individually identified. As we may be conducting certain surveys with our business partners or other third parties, we may also share the anonymized results of those surveys with those third parties, but we will not share Personal Information.

**Toyota Safety Connect®:** If you have a Toyota Safety Connect® Subscription Agreement, we collect Personal Information necessary to meet your requests and may use your Personal Information to facilitate your usage of the Toyota Safety Connect® Service to which you subscribe. We may share your information with our business partners to assist us in fulfilling your requests.

4\. INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THIRD PARTIES

Toyota may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another Web site and you opt-in to receive information from Toyota, that Web site will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to participate in a third-party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third-party Web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third-party Web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third-party Web site or interactive service.

We may also supplement the information we collect about you through the Sites with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from these third parties with information we collect through the Sites. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received, unless we have disclosed otherwise.

5\. YOUR CHOICES AND ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION

The Sites gives you choices. If you choose to receive e-mails from us about products and other information, we strive to keep your Personal Information updated and accurate.

If you provided Toyota with Personal Information through the Owners section of toyota.com, you may review and update that information by clicking on the Owners link on the homepage of toyota.com, registering or logging in and then clicking on "Update Profile." If you are an Owner who subscribes to the Toyota owner e-mail list, you can access the Preferences page and change your user profile or unsubscribe from the Toyota e-mail list [here](https://access.toyota.com/optin_home.aspx).

For users who are not currently registered on our owner site, please call Customer Satisfaction at 800-331-4331 to opt out from receiving e-mail communications from Toyota. If you receive an e-mail, you may opt-out at any time by following the opt-out instructions provided in the e-mail you receive.

If you are participating in a Program, you may be able to access and update the information you provided as part of your participation in the Program. Please see the section of the Sites concerning the specific Program to determine if you are able to access your information and how to do so.

In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Sites. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.

6\. ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING; HOW TO OPT-OUT

Toyota licenses technology to serve advertisements on its own Sites and within its content as that content is served across the Internet. In addition, Toyota may use third-party ad networks, publishers and other entities to serve advertisements and third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Sites and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these third parties, but ad network providers, data providers, publishers and other media-related companies, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, including Usage Information. We and they may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the Sites and other Web sites. We and they may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements.

If you prefer to not receive targeted advertising, you can opt-out of some network advertising programs that use your information. To do so please visit the NAI Opt-Out Page. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.

7\. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

The Sites are not intended for children under the age of 13. Toyota does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children that young. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit your e-mail address or any other Personal Information to us through the Sites.

8\. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

We use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your Personal Information. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you use the Sites and provide us with your information at your own risk.

_Beware of Phishing Scams_ : There have been noticeable increases in the number of suspicious e-mails claiming that the e-mail recipient has won a Toyota lottery or other promotion. Sometimes the e-mail claims that the recipient has won a new Toyota Prius. In order to claim the prize, the e-mail asks that Personal Information be sent to a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail address. Samples of these hoax e-mails can be found at this Web site.

This type of e-mail solicitation is known commonly as a "phishing" scam, with the primary objective being to obtain one's personal information. This information can then be utilized to steal a person's identity. For example, a "Toyota Lottery" phishing scam is often sent from Chinese (.cn), German (.de) or British (.co.uk) addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of Internet users. Toyota will never ask you to send passwords, login names, Social Security Numbers, or other personal information through e-mail or U.S. mail or fax or text message. If you receive an e-mail or letter by U.S. mail or fax or text message from Toyota asking you to update your credit card information, do not respond: this is a phishing scam. Recipients of suspicious e-mail like this should delete the message from their inbox and, if possible, update their e-mail filter settings to block e-mails from the e-mail address being used. The Federal Trade Commission and the Antiphishing Workgroup are also good sources of information about these types of security threats and how they may be reported to the authorities.

9\. LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES

The Sites include links to other Web sites, such as the Web site for Toyota Financial Services and to Web sites for Toyota dealers. These Web sites are not under our control, even though they may use the Toyota name or logo on their site through an agreement with us. Such other Web sites do not necessarily follow our Privacy Policy, and may place their own cookies on your Device. This practice is standard on the Web, and we do not control cookies or Web beacons that may be placed on your Device by third parties whose advertising or links appear on our Sites. These Web sites may have their own privacy and information security policy and terms and conditions. Visitors should consult the other Web sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

To reach Toyota dealer sites, please click [here](https://web.archive.org/dealers/).

10\. CONSENT TO PROCESSING AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION

The Sites are operated in the United States. Given that we are an international business, our use of your information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States. By using the Sites, or providing us with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.

11\. CHANGES

Please note, we may change information on the Sites and/or this Privacy Policy, at any time without prior notice to you, and any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Sites. However, Toyota will use your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent to the new or revised policy.
