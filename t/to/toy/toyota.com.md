This document describes Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.'s ("Toyota") policy regarding information received about you during visits to our Web site. The amount and type of information received depends on how you use the site. These privacy provisions apply solely to Toyota's online information collection activities on this Web site and are not applicable to information collection practices Toyota may be engaged in elsewhere.

_By using this site, you signify your assent to the Toyota Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time; the date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page, so please visit us frequently._

No Representation or Warranty  
Your confidential use of this site cannot be guaranteed by Toyota. Toyota shall not be responsible for any harm that you or any person may suffer as a result of a breach of confidentiality in respect to your use of this site or any information you transmitted to this site.

Normal Web Site Usage  
You can visit Toyota's Web site to read vehicle product information or use our online tools, such as the calculators and configurators, without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information (other than, in some cases, your zip code). When you do this, we collect and store the name of your Internet service provider, the browser (including available plug-ins and browser functionality) and type of machine you are using, the IP address, the Web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time of those requests.

We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits. During normal Web site usage, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, or phone number.

Collection and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information  
There are instances where Toyota requests information about you to provide you with a service or information, such as new vehicle information alerts, promotions and mailed brochures. Depending upon the type of request, the information we collect may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, date of birth and what service or information you have requested. Your personal information is collected and stored by Toyota in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data. The information you provide is also used by Toyota to improve the services we provide you.

Your personal information may be shared with our business partners to assist us in fulfilling your request. We may also share your personal information with companies affiliated with Toyota, our private distributors, and our authorized dealers and dealer advertising associations.

From time to time, Toyota may request information about you to enable you to participate in promotional activities, such as sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, blogs and chats ("Programs"). Sometimes Programs are made available through the joint efforts of Toyota and an unaffiliated business partner. If you choose to participate, we may use the information you provide in connection with the Program. For example, we may send you email messages related to the Program or your account activity, or for selection and notification of sweepstakes or contest winners. Your personal information may also be shared with our business partner and may also be used by our business partner if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that company. If you elect to receive communications from our business partner, your information will be used by that company in accordance with its policies and this privacy policy will not apply to that company's use of your information. Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the personal information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program. If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Policy, those applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us with any personal information.

Please remember that blogs are public areas on Toyota's Web site and chat rooms may be public areas on Toyota's Web site. Please refer to the Program details. Any information posted in these areas can be viewed by other visitors or Internet users. You should not post personal information in these areas.

For some features on Toyota's Web site, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you wish to invite your friends to participate in a Program offered on Toyota's Web site or forward particular content from Toyota's Web site to your friends, you will be asked to submit your friends' email addresses. Our use, sharing and protection of the other person's information will also be subject to the terms of the Program and this Privacy Policy.

Surveys  
From time to time we may conduct surveys on Toyota's Web site. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain demographic information (such as your gender, date of birth and zip code). We may use the information that you submit, including your responses to the survey questions, for the purposes identified to you prior to your participation in the survey. In some cases, we may publish the results of the survey but will do so only as aggregate information and you will not be individually identified. As we may be conducting certain surveys with our business partners or other third parties, we may also share the results of those surveys with those third parties but will not identify individuals.

Disclosure for Legal Purposes  
Toyota reserves the right to disclose any personally identifiable information or other information we collect through this Web site or otherwise if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably believe that the disclosure is necessary in order to (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the requirements of law or to comply with legal process served on us; (c) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Toyota, Toyota's Web site or its users, or third party licensors of any material on Toyota's Web site; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health or safety of the users of Toyota's Web site or the general public.
