2\. What information does the "R" Us Family collect? 

  


Each time you visit an "R" Us Site, the web server automatically collects your internet service provider's address, the web page from which you came, web browser software, and a record of your activity while visiting the site. 

The "R" Us Family members collect personally identifiable information (such as first and last name, credit card number, home address, e-mail address and telephone number) that you provide when you make a purchase; visit the Retail Stores or the "R" Us Sites; create or edit your registries and wish lists; participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion; fill out a survey or questionnaire; sign up for a program or club; contact an "R" Us Family member (by e-mail or otherwise); contact an "R" Us Family customer service representative; or otherwise interact with an "R" Us Family member.

The information you provide to "R" Us Family members may also be combined with demographic and other information that is available in order to allow the "R" Us Family members to better communicate with you and enhance your shopping experience. 

For purposes of this policy, information regarding your children that you (the parent) provide to the "R" Us Family is treated in the same manner as information collected about you.
