**2\. What information do we collect?**

As used in this Privacy Policy, "personal information" is information about an identifiable individual human being, as defined in privacy laws applicable to the "R"Us Family. Personal information does not include aggregated information that does not allow an individual to be identified.

The "R"Us Family members collect personal information (including, without limitation, names, addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses) that you provide when you (a) visit the Online Store and kiosks located in the Retail Stores; (b) create or edit your Registries and Wish Lists; (c) participate in a contest or sweepstakes promotion; (d) sign up for and/or fill out a survey or questionnaire; (e) contact an "R"Us Family member (by email or otherwise); (f) contact an "R"Us Family customer service representative; (g) otherwise interact with an "R"Us Family member; or (h) provide product reviews and/or feedback.

Each time you visit the "R"Us Site or the Online Store, the web server automatically collects your Internet service provider's address, the web page from which you logged in, web browser software and a record of your activity while visiting the site. Unless you tell us who you are, this information is non-personal information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Please see Section 8 below for further information about cookies.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, information regarding your children that you (the parent) provide to the "R"Us Family is treated in the same manner as information collected about you. Please see Section 3 below for further information regarding children's privacy. As noted above, by submitting personal information of another individual, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary authority and/or consent from such individual to enable us to collect, use and disclose such personal information in accordance with the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, credit risk reduction, debt collection, insurance coverage and in the course of investigating and resolving disputes and litigation.

**On Registries and Wish Lists.** Registries and Wish Lists are made available for viewing by others. If you create your Registry or Wish List at a kiosk located in a Retail Store, and elect to make it available online, your information will be accessible at the Online Store.
