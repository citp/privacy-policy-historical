Normal Website Usage**

You can visit Toyota Financial Services' website to read product, investment, and company information, or use some of our online tools (e.g., What's Right for Me? and Payment Estimator) without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. During these types of visits, we collect and store statistical information on an anonymous basis, such as the information about the time and length of your visit, the website you last visited, the pages you request, and the date and time of those requests. We may also collect and store the name of your Internet Service Provider.

We use cookies when you enter our website to help us gather this type of statistical information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes so that we can track website and user activity.
