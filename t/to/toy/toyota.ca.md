**Pixel tags.** A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon, clear GIFs or tracking beacon, placed on a web site or in an e-mail, which indicates to us that a page or e-mail has been viewed. In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.

We and they may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the TCI web sites and other web sites.
