# TOYOTA CANADA: Privacy Policy

##  Toyota Privacy Policy   
Respecting Customer Information 

### The Toyota (Lexus) (Scion) Commitment to Your Privacy

Toyota Canada Inc. ("TCI"), which includes Toyota, Lexus and Scion brands, respects your right to privacy. This Policy outlines how TCI's privacy principles protect your privacy as a key part of TCI's on-going sales and service relationship with you as a valued Toyota (Lexus) (Scion) customer. The privacy principles apply to all personal information that TCI collects from customers. Personal information refers to any personally identifiable information about you. It does not include aggregate information that does not identify you specifically.

### What Personal Information Does TCI Collect?

In connection with your vehicle purchase, TCI collects the information provided by you that is necessary for your Toyota (Lexus) (Scion) dealership to complete the transaction, including your name, address, telephone number(s), email address, driver's license and insurance information. TCI also records information respecting the vehicle purchased, the purchase price and other transaction information. TCI will also collect personal information from you through customer surveys, inquiries or requests for information and your visits to TCI web sites. You will only be asked to provide personal information in order to enable TCI to provide you with a service (such as sending you a new vehicle brochure, assisting you in contacting a dealership, or enabling you to complete online credit or job applications). 

If you apply for credit with Toyota Credit Canada Inc. ("TCCI"), TCCI will obtain credit approval information from you and third parties. The full TCCI Privacy Policy, which outlines how TCCI's privacy principles protect your privacy as a key part of its ongoing business relationship with you as a valued Toyota (Lexus) (Scion) customer, is available here [TCCI Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20130805173643id_/http%3A//www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/privacy/tcci).

As part of TCI's on-going efforts to better understand your automotive needs and improve the products and the quality and efficiency of TCI and TCI's dealership's provision of these products and services to you, TCI will, from time to time, ask you to provide information regarding your purchase preferences, demographics and lifestyle through customer surveys.

TCI will also collect any information that you provide through your customer service inquiries or when TCI responds to your requests for information.

TCI also collects information that you provide during visits to TCI web sites, including contact information, vehicle information, customer survey information, visitor's dealership and language preferences, owner information, and contest entry information.

### TCI's Web Sites

Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit TCI's web sites, unless you tell TCI who you are or reveal any other personal information, TCI does not collect or store any information about you. The only information TCI collects and stores is non-personally identifiable information such as the name of your Internet service provider, the type of the Internet browser you used, and referring web site and the pages you request. TCI uses this non-personally identifiable information to generate aggregate statistics regarding TCI's web site activity.

Cookies. Cookies are files that your web browser places on your computer's hard drive that permit TCI to tell whether, and if so, how many times, you have accessed TCI's web sites previously, your interests and preferences, your language of choice, your dealer of choice, the province in which your internet provider resides, internet user behavioral analysis, and your computer system's flash preference. You may choose to decline to accept cookies if your browser permits but doing so may affect your use of TCI's web sites and your ability to access certain features of the web sites.

Pixel tags. A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a web beacon, clear GIFs or tracking beacon, placed on a web site or in an e-mail, which indicates to us that a page or e-mail has been viewed. In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.

Third-Party Links. TCI's web sites contain links to other sites. When you click on links that take you to third party web sites, you will be subject to the third parties' privacy policies. While TCI supports the protection of privacy on the Internet, TCI is not responsible for the actions of third parties or for their privacy practices.

### Advertising/Behavioral Targeting; How To Opt-Out

TCI licenses technology to serve advertisements on its own web sites and within its content as that content is served across the Internet. In addition, TCI may use third-party ad networks, publishers and other entities to serve advertisements and third party analytics vendors to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the TCI web sites and viewing of our content.

Ad network providers, data providers, publishers and other media-related companies, and/or analytics service providers may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device’s web browser and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you. We and they may target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to both the TCI web sites and other web sites.

These opt-outs will not be effective if your browser is configured to reject cookies, or if you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change browsers. Please note that even if you opt-out, you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides links to those companies.
