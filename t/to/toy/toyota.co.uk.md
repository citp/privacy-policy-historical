We also have a legitimate interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, to verify identity and to assess your creditworthiness, provided that your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.

 ** _Credit reference agencies and the Credit Reference Agency Information Notice_**   
In order to process applications for our products or services, we will perform credit and identity checks about you with one or more Credit Reference Agencies (‘CRA’). These CRAs are Equifax and Experian.  
To do this, we will supply your personal information to CRAs and they will give us information about you. This will include information from your credit application and about your financial situation and financial history. CRAs will supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit, financial situation and financial history information and fraud prevention information.  
We will continue to exchange information about you with CRAs while you have a relationship with us. We will also inform the CRAs about your settled accounts. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt. This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs.  
When CRAs receive a search request from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.  
If you are making a joint application, or tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will link your records together, so you should make sure you discuss this with them, and share with them this information, before lodging the application. CRAs will also link your records together and these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that link.  
If we share your personal information with a CRA your personal information will be used and processed by the CRA in accordance with the provisions of the CRA’s Credit Reference Agency Information Notice (referred to as the ‘CRAIN’).  
The identities of the CRAs, their role also as fraud prevention agencies, the data they hold, the ways in which they use and share personal information, data retention periods and your data protection rights with the CRAs are explained in more detail in their respective CRAINs.  
The CRAINs are accessible from each of the CRAs on their websites. Their websites and CRAINs are located at the following web addresses:

 **Fraud prevention agencies**  
Cifas is the data controller of the Cifas National Fraud Database.

 **Transferring information outside of the European Economic Area**  
Our business, products and services are provided and targeted within the United Kingdom. For this reason we do not envisage that we will need to transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area.   
If we do need to need to transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area we will ensure that the personal information is protected by appropriate safeguards, such safeguards include at least one of the following:

  * The destination country has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
  * The service provider is bound by relevant and specific contractual obligations.
  * If a transfer is to the USA, that the service provider is part of the US Privacy Shield which requires similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the USA.



 **Retention - how long we will use and retain your personal information**  
We retain your personal information for as long as we consider is necessary. In retaining your personal data we consider: 

  * The duration of the purposes that we collected it for, importantly the duration that we are obliged to provide the relevant product or service.
  * Fulfilling, managing and concluding our relationship with you.
  * The time periods within which we have rights to claim against and pursue you and the time periods within which you have the right to claim against and pursue us.



We also retain personal data for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements and guidance. Typically this is a period of six years after you cease to have a contract or relationship with us.  
We may irreversibly anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use this anonymous information indefinitely without further notice to you.

 **Data security**  
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.  
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach or incident and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach or incident where we are legally required to do so.  
If we share personal information with third parties, we require that they take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information. We do not allow third party service providers to use your personal information for their own irrelevant purposes, they are only allowed to use and process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

 **Your rights**  
Data protection law requires us to tell you about our use and processing of your personal data and gives you rights in relation to the use of your personal data. Under certain circumstances you have the right to:

 ** _Request access:_** is commonly known as a ‘data subject access request.’ This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.  
 ** _Request correction:_** this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new personal data you provide to us.  
 ** _Request erasure:_** this enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it, where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with law. We may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.  
 ** _Object to processing:_** you have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to our processing. For further information about the right to object please see the ‘Right of objection’ section below.  
 ** _Request restriction of processing:_** this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following circumstances: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.  
 ** _Request the transfer:_** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.  
 ** _Withdraw consent at any time:_** where we are relying on your consent to process your personal data. Any withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.  
If you would like to exercise any of these rights please contact us (See the ‘How to contact us’ section above).

 **Right of objection**  
You have a right to object to our use of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.   
If you would like to exercise your right to object please contact us (See the ‘How to contact us’ section above).

 **No fee usually required**  
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information or to exercise any of your other rights. We may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

 **What we may need from you**  
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information or to exercise any of your other rights. This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

 **Information Commissioner’s Office**  
You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). We would recommend that any questions or concerns are directed to us in first instance, before the ICO is approached. The ICO is the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues ([www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/))
