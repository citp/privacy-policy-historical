# Toyota Privacy Policy

## Toyota privacy policy

Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited ('Toyota') aims to provide its customers with the best possible products and service. To achieve this, we aim to make efficient use of the personal information we collect from our customers.

We also want our customers and other persons with whom we interact to have confidence that in handling personal information, we afford that information an appropriate level of privacy, consistent with the Australian Privacy Principles.

This statement sets out our policy for dealing with your personal information. This privacy policy does not cover personal information collected or held by Toyota about its employees. For the Lexus Australia (a division of Toyota) Privacy Policy, please visit [lexus.com.au](http://www.lexus.com.au/)

### What kinds of Personal Information does Toyota collect?

Personal Information is any information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.

The kinds of personal information that we collect and hold about you will depend on the circumstances of collection, including whether we collect the information from you as a customer, dealer, supplier, contractor, stakeholder, job applicant, community grant applicant or in some other capacity.

For example, if you are a customer or a potential customer, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, licence number, vehicle purchase details and service history. If you deal with us in some other capacity (for example, as a dealer, a supplier or a stakeholder), we may collect your name, contact details and any other information you choose to provide to us.

We will only collect sensitive information about you with your consent (unless we are otherwise allowed or required by law to collect that information). Sensitive information includes information about your health, race, ethnic origin and religious beliefs.

If we are not able to collect your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services or do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected.

If you provide us with personal information about another person (such as a joint vehicle owner), please make sure that you tell them about this privacy policy.

### How does Toyota collect personal information?

Where possible, Toyota will collect your personal information directly from you. This may take place in a number of ways, such as when you interact with us in writing (including if you give us a written order), or ask us to provide a product or service or otherwise deal with us over the telephone or internet.

Our website may also offer interactive facilities, such as customer enquiry or comment forms and competition entry forms, where personal information may be collected. If you enter our competitions using your social media account (where available), we may collect information about you from your social media profile.

In addition, we may obtain personal information of customers and prospective customers from third parties such as our dealers and distributors, contractors and regulatory authorities, and from marketing and similar lists which are legally acquired by us.

Regardless of who provides personal information to us, it will always be handled by Toyota in accordance with this privacy policy and the Australian Privacy Principles.

### How does Toyota use personal information?

Toyota (including its related bodies corporate) collects personal information for a range of purposes relating to the products and services it offers. Those purposes include:

    * responding to enquiries regarding vehicles and vehicle sales, products and accessories and services we offer
    * receiving feedback and dealing with complaints
    * processing orders and administering accounts
    * providing customer and dealer support
    * considering job applicants for current and future employment
    * vehicle warranties and product recalls
    * marketing and promotional activities
    * product development and market research
    * managing our relationships with our dealers, suppliers and stakeholders
    * meeting our regulatory and legal obligations.



We may also use your information for other purposes required or authorised by or under law (including purposes for which you have provided your consent).

In conducting our activities, we may sometimes need to disclose your personal information to others. Examples of the types of organisations we may need to disclose information to are:

    * Toyota's related bodies corporate (including our parent company Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan)
    * Toyota dealers
    * parts suppliers
    * insurers and financiers
    * a person outside Toyota who is contracted to us to provide a particular service on our behalf.



Some examples of the kinds of organisations with which we contract are:

  * mailing houses for bulk mailing of letters and notices;
  * printers for marketing material;
  * organisations that assist us to conduct promotions or market research;
  * information technology service providers;
  * customer service centre providers; and
  * accountants, lawyers and other service providers.



Some of our service providers and companies in the Toyota group are located overseas, including our parent company Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan. As a result, personal information collected and held by Toyota may be transferred overseas. In particular, we use service providers located overseas to store customer data, including in the US, the UK and Sweden.

Sometimes, the law requires us to disclose personal information. For example, information may be disclosed to a court in response to a subpoena or to a Government agency such as a vehicle licensing authority or the Australian Taxation Office. We also disclose driver and vehicle information to the National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System (NEVDIS)

We may also disclose your personal information to other third parties and for other purposes with your consent. That consent may be written, verbal or implied from your conduct.

### Direct marketing

From time to time, we may use personal information to inform our customers, prospective customers and other persons with whom we interact about our products and services, or about special offers, promotions and events that we think may be of interest to you. We may provide this information using any contact number or address provided, including without limitation by post, phone, email and SMS. We will generally give you the opportunity to express a wish not to receive direct marketing communications. Your consent to receive direct marketing communications in the above ways will be deemed if you do not opt out when we offer you the opportunity to do so, and will remain current for an indefinite period of time unless and until you advise us otherwise. You can opt-out of receiving direct marketing at any time (see below).

Toyota does not disclose personal information to organisations outside Toyota and its related companies for the purposes of allowing them to direct market their products. However, we may join motor vehicle dealers and other business associates of Toyota in joint marketing of our respective products and services to customers.

If the law requires us to provide you with information about our products or services, we will provide that information even if you have elected not to receive information about our products and services generally.

_How can you opt out of receiving direct marketing?_

You can let us know at any time if you do not want the personal information we hold about you to be used or disclosed for any of the above purposes, or you do not wish to be contacted in any of the above ways, by contacting us in any of the ways set out at the bottom of this policy. In some circumstances we may need to contact you to obtain additional information, to verify your identity or to clarify your request.

### Ensuring personal information is up-to-date

We rely on the personal information we hold in conducting our business. Therefore, it is very important that the information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate, complete, up-to-date and relevant whenever we collect or use it. This means that from time to time, we will ask you to tell us if there are any changes to your personal information. If you find that information we hold about you is incorrect, please contact us immediately (in any of the ways set out at the bottom of this policy) and we will take reasonable steps to correct it.

Back to the top

### Security of personal information

We may store your information in hardcopy and/or in electronic form. Security of personal information is important to us and we take reasonable precautions to protect personal information from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

Some of the ways we protect personal information include:

  * external and internal premises security;
  * restricting access to personal information only to staff who need it to perform their day to day functions;
  * maintaining technology products to prevent unauthorised computer access or damage to electronically stored information, such as requiring identifiers and passwords, firewalls and anti-virus software; and
  * maintaining physical security over paper records.



### Access to personal information by individuals

You can request access to the personal information we hold about you by contacting us in any of the ways set out at the bottom of this policy, and we will generally provide you with access subject to some exceptions permitted by law.

We may charge an access fee to cover the reasonable cost of retrieving the information and supplying it to you.

Access to personal information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict your access, we will explain why.

### If you send us an email

If you send us an email containing personal information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of that information. The content of emails is sometimes monitored by our Internet Host for maintenance and fault detection purposes. We may also monitor email for legal compliance purposes. Emails may also be sent to our dealers or contractors when they relate to product or service enquiries or complaints. They also treat the information confidentially, but do record the information in Toyota's internal customer databases.

Although we take steps to protect information sent by email, email is not a secure method of communication and if you are concerned about sending your personal information to us in this manner you may prefer to contact us in any of the ways set out at the bottom of this policy.

### Credit reporting

We participate in the comprehensive credit reporting system to enable us to make better and more informed decisions about providing credit to our customers. When you apply for credit with us, or propose to be a guarantor, we may request a credit report about you from a CRB. Credit reports contain information about your credit history that will help us assess your credit worthiness and your ability to repay credit.

#### What credit information and credit eligibility information do we collect and hold?

The credit information we collect and hold includes your identification details, the type of credit you hold, the amount of credit borrowed, the terms and conditions of your credit, when your credit was opened or closed, whether or not you have met your repayment obligations under your loan contract and loan contracts with other credit providers, and information about your credit worthiness. The credit eligibility information we collect and hold includes credit reports obtained from a CRB and our own rating or score which help us to assess your creditworthiness.

#### What do we do with credit information and credit eligibility information? 

We collect, hold, use and disclose credit information and credit eligibility information about you for purposes which include: 

  * confirming your identity;
  * assessing your consumer or commercial credit or guarantor application;
  * managing your account and collecting any overdue payments;
  * helping you avoid defaulting on your loan;
  * complying with any relevant laws and regulations.



We will use the information obtained from a CRB, and combine it with information we already hold about you, to calculate our own rating or score to help us assess your creditworthiness.

We may also disclose to the CRB if you have not met the payment obligations under your loan contract or if you have committed a serious credit infringement (for example fraud). Some of the information we disclose to a CRB may be included in your credit report and provided to other credit providers to help them assess your creditworthiness. 

We may disclose your information to any of the following CRBs: 

  * Dun and Bradstreet - [dnb.com.au](http://www.dnb.com.au/)\- **1300 734 806**
  * Experian - [experian.com.au](http://www.experian.com.au/) \- **1300 784 134**
  * Veda - [veda.com.au](http://www.veda.com.au/)



If you would like to know how these organisations manage your information, you can get a copy of their policies on their websites or by calling the numbers above.

#### What are your rights?

You have the right to ask a CRB not to use your information for the purpose of pre-screening of direct marketing by a credit provider. You can ask them not to use or disclose this information for a period of time if you reasonably believe that you have been, or are likely to be, a victim of fraud. 

Back to the top

### Holding and protecting your information

We hold information about you (including credit information) in both physical and electronic forms.

For example, we ensure that: 

  * each of our offices has security protocols in place to prevent unauthorised entry;
  * access to your information is restricted to only the personnel who need it to perform their duties;
  * any internally and externally hosted secure servers which store your information in electronic form have the necessary encryption protocols; and

From time to time, if we are permitted by law to do so, we or any of the third parties referred to in the section 'Who do we disclose your information to?' may exchange and use your information to tell you about any products or services, including special offers, promotions and events that may be of interest to you. We may also send you material relating to joint promotions with motor vehicle dealers and our business associates of our respective products and services.

Before we act on a request, we will provide an estimate of the access fee and ask you to agree to it. 

Access to your information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or if the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict your access, we will write to you to let you know why, unless, having regard to the grounds for the refusal, it would be unreasonable for us to do so. You may make a complaint about a refusal to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. 

We rely on the information that we hold about individuals to conduct our business. Therefore, it is very important that the information we hold is accurate, complete, up to date and relevant. This means that, from time to time, we may ask you if there are any changes to your information. If you find that any information that we hold about you is incorrect, you should contact us immediately and we will take reasonable steps to correct it.

Where appropriate we will disclose your personal information to our related entities or other third parties (for example Toyota Finance) who provide services to us or on our behalf for purposes such as processing a claim, validating and confirming information, administering policies and where customer research is conducted on our behalf. The types of entities to which we may disclose your personal information include:

  * related entities (for management of your policy or if they take over any of our functions or activities as a result of a restructure or otherwise);
  * other insurance companies (for example the life insurers of our finance protection insurance policies) and re-insurers (for example to confirm your insurance profile);

  * our third party Information Technology (IT) and other service providers (for example our mailing house or our lawyers);
  * your employer;
  * claims/loss assessors, loss adjustors, investigators and recovery agents (for example when a claim requires assessment or investigation);
  * repairers, suppliers, medical practitioners, rehabilitation providers and case managers;

### Security of your personal information

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information against loss, misuse, interference and unauthorised access, alteration or disclosure. For example access to the personal information that we store on our systems is subject to the use of secure passwords and identifiers and we also implement reasonable physical security measures.

However, no security measure is completely secure and, despite the procedures we have put in place, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information (particularly in relation to transmissions over the internet). Any information which you transmit to us is transmitted at your own risk. You must also make sure you protect your personal information, for example by protecting your usernames, passwords and policy details. You should notify us as soon as you become aware of any such security breaches.

### How to access and correct your personal information

We take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we collect and hold is accurate, complete and up to date. However, we rely on you to advise us about any changes to your personal information to help us maintain accurate, complete and up-to-date information. Please let us know if you think any information we hold about you is not accurate, complete or up to date.

On request, we will provide you with access to your personal information that we hold (unless otherwise required or permitted by applicable law). We will notify you of the basis for any denial to access your information

In most cases, a summary of basic policy information such as your name, address, contact details, policy details or copies of documents such as repair quotations can be requested by phone and will be sent to you.

Although some requests can be made by telephone, for others (such as a relevant assessor's or investigator's report) we may need you to complete a written application.

Please contact us on 137 200 if you would like information on how to request access to such information.

There is no charge for making a request.
