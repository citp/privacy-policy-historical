**Providing someone else’s personal information:** If you provide us with personal information about another person (such as a joint vehicle owner or authorised driver or contact person), please tell them about this Policy so they are aware that you have provided their information to us and that they can read this Policy to understand how their information will be handled.

**Information we collect automatically**

Whenever you visit or interact with a Toyota Group website or other online platform of ours (“ **Platforms** ”), we, as well as any third-party service provider and/or advertiser, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively record information about how the Platform is accessed and used (“ **Usage Information** ”).

Usage Information helps us keep our Platforms relevant to users and allows us to tailor content to a user’s interests. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as personal information.

We may use Device Identifiers to help us administer Platforms, diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends, observe Platform usage and activity over time, help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

We or our vendors may place cookies on your Device for security purposes, to facilitate site navigation and personalise your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences, location or demographic information).

To learn how you may manage cookies, or delete cookies that have already been installed, please refer to your browser’s help menu or instructions. If you disable or opt out of receiving cookies, some features and functions on our Platforms may not work properly or fully because we may not be able to recognise and associate you with your Toyota account(s). In addition, the offers we provide may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.

**Remarketing:** We use Google Adwords Remarketing to advertise our products and services online. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to display relevant ads based on your past visits to our website(s).

If you do not wish to receive marketing communications and surveys from a member of the Network, you can let that organisation know at any time using the contact details in their respective privacy policies or utilising the “unsubscribe” or other opt-out function offered by the organisation.

If you do not wish to receive any marketing communications from Toyota Australia or Toyota Finance, you can let the relevant organisation know using the contact details provided in section 13 “Contacting us” below, or by utilising the “unsubscribe” function in electronic communications from the organisation. In some circumstances we may need to contact you to obtain additional information, verify your identity or to clarify your request, in order to action it.

If the law requires us to provide you with information about our products or services (for example, product recalls), we will provide that information even if you have elected not to receive information about our products and services generally.

### 8.    Credit reporting (applies only if you seek finance from Toyota Finance)

In this section, references to “we”, “us” or “our” refer to Toyota Finance only, not Toyota Australia. Toyota Finance participates in the comprehensive credit reporting system to make better and more informed decisions about providing credit to our customers. When you apply for credit with Toyota Finance, or propose to be a guarantor, we may request a credit report about you from a CRB. Credit reports contain information about your credit history that will help us assess your credit worthiness and your ability to repay credit.

**What credit information and credit eligibility information do we collect and hold?**

The credit information we collect and hold includes your identification details, the type of credit you hold, the amount of credit borrowed, the terms and conditions of your credit, when your credit was opened or closed, whether or not you have met your repayment obligations under your loan contract and loan contracts with other credit providers, and information about your credit worthiness. The credit eligibility information we collect and hold includes credit reports obtained from a CRB and our own rating or score which help us to assess your creditworthiness.

**What do we do with credit information and credit eligibility information?**

We collect, hold, use and disclose credit information and credit eligibility information about you for purposes which include:

  * confirming your identity;
  * assessing your consumer or commercial credit or guarantor application;
  * managing your account and collecting any overdue payments;
  * helping you avoid defaulting on your loan;
  * complying with any relevant laws and regulations.



We will use the information obtained from a CRB, and combine it with information we already hold about you, to calculate our own rating or score to help us assess your creditworthiness.

We may also disclose to the CRB if you have not met the payment obligations under your loan contract or if you have committed a serious credit infringement (for example fraud). Some of the information we disclose to a CRB may be included in your credit report and provided to other credit providers to help them assess your creditworthiness.

We may disclose your information to any of the following CRBs:

  * Dun and Bradstreet - [dnb.com.au](http://www.dnb.com.au/) \- **1300 734 806**
  * Experian - [experian.com.au](http://www.experian.com.au/) \- **1300 784 134**
  * Veda - [veda.com.au](http://www.veda.com.au/)



If you would like to know how these organisations manage your information, you can view their privacy policies on their websites or contact them directly by calling the numbers above.

**What are your rights?**

You have the right to ask a CRB not to use your information for the purpose of pre-screening or direct marketing by a credit provider. You can ask them not to use or disclose this information for a period of time if you reasonably believe that you have been, or are likely to be, a victim of fraud.

### 9.   Holding and protecting your information

We may hold information about you in digital and paper forms. We take reasonable steps to protect your information from misuse, loss, interference, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the ways we protect your information include:

  * external and internal premises security;
  * restricting access to your information only to personnel who need it to perform their functions;
  * utilising and maintaining information security applications to prevent unauthorised access or damage to electronically stored information, such as requiring identifiers and passwords, firewalls and anti-virus software; and 
  * maintaining physical security over paper records.



### 10.    Disclosing your information overseas

We may disclose your information to organisations located overseas. These include:

  * our related companies in Japan and elsewhere in the world; or
  * our service providers that are located or hold data overseas including in the USA, Singapore, the UK and Sweden. 



### 11.    Accessing and correcting your information

You can generally access and request the correction of information we hold about you by contacting us in any of the ways set out at the bottom of this policy. Please note that the organisations comprising the OneToyota Network (that is, each of Toyota Australia, Toyota Finance, each Toyota dealer, Toyota Insurance and Toyota Western Australia) are separate organisations, and each organisation may hold different information about you (if any). 

We may charge an access fee to recover the reasonable costs incurred. This charge is only designed to help us reasonably recover the costs associated with providing you with access and does not apply to the making of the request. Before we act on a request, we will provide an estimate of the access fee and ask you to agree to it.

Access to your information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or if the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict your access, we will write to you to let you know why, unless, having regard to the grounds for the refusal, it would be unreasonable for us to do so. You may make a complaint about a refusal to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.

We rely on the information that we hold about you to provide our products and services to you, and to perform our business functions. Therefore, it is very important that the information we hold is accurate, complete, up to date and relevant. This means that, from time to time, we may ask you if your information is still accurate and up to date. If you find that any information that we hold about you is incorrect, you should contact us immediately and we will take reasonable steps to correct it.

### 12.    Resolving concerns

If you believe that your privacy has been compromised, or if you feel that we have breached the privacy laws, you are entitled to make a complaint. Complaints can be made by contacting the person or department you were dealing with, or by contacting us using our contact details set out at the bottom of this policy.

We endeavour to respond to you within 24 hours to acknowledge the complaint and explain how we will investigate it. This may include consulting with the CRB or other credit providers if the complaint relates to your credit information. We will try to resolve your complaint within 20 working days and write to you to explain the reasons for our decision. When this is not possible, we will contact you and let you know how long it will take for us to resolve your complaint.

If your complaint is not satisfactorily resolved, you can contact us to discuss your concerns or lodge a complaint with Office of the Australian Information Commissioner by visiting [oaic.gov.au](http://www.oaic.gov.au/), calling **1300 363 992** or emailing [enquiries@oaic.gov.au](mailto:enquiries@oaic.gov.au). If your complaint relates to your finance with us you may access the Financial Ombudsman Service at [fos.org.au](http://www.fos.org.au/) or by calling **1300 780 808**.

We will only collect, hold, use or disclose sensitive information (including health information or past criminal convictions) about you for the purposes noted in this privacy policy, with your consent or if required by law and if the information is necessary to provide you with cover or process a claim under any of our products.

### How do we collect personal information?

We collect your personal information in various ways, such as over the phone, in one of the Toyota Dealers’ premises, in one of our offices or over the internet if you transact with us online or via one of our partners – Toyota Finance Australia Limited, Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited or a Toyota Dealer (collectively the **“Toyota Family”** ).

Whenever possible, we collect your personal information directly from you. However, we may collect personal information about you from someone else. For example, from our intermediaries, including intermediaries in the Toyota network (if you apply for, receive or acquire a Toyota Insurance product or service via them), other insurers, medical practitioners, assessors, repairers, your employer, another party involved in a claim or your family members.

Please note that our intermediaries may (but only with your consent) obtain a credit report about you from a credit agency for the purpose of a loan application assessment or to obtain financial details from your accountant and may provide a copy of this report to us.

Irrespective of the source, we respect and value your personal information and will deal with it in the manner set out in this privacy policy.

We may also request for you to provide us with personal information about someone else, such as a co-insured person or a witness to an accident that is the subject of a claim. Before providing us with such information, you must tell the person that you will be providing personal information about them to us and that their information

will be handled in accordance with this privacy policy. You must also provide them with a copy of (or refer them to where they can obtain a copy of) this privacy policy. If you provide us with the personal information of another person, you warrant that you have that person’s consent to do so.

### How do we use your personal information?

We collect your personal information for the purposes for which it was provided to us, other related purposes or as authorised or required by law. These purposes include:

  * communicating with you, providing you with the assistance, products and/or services you have requested and processing any payments; 
  * setting premiums appropriately and compiling statistics;
  * managing, assessing and paying claims;
  * conducting market research to better understand the needs of our customers;
  * enabling any of the Toyota Family to conduct their own market research to better understand the needs of Toyota customers; 
  * providing you with marketing material and keeping you informed of special offers, new products or services of ours or any of the Toyota Family that we believe you may be interested in ( **“Toyota Marketing”** ) (if you have consented to receiving such); and
  * any other purposes specified at the time of collecting your personal information.



We will only use your sensitive information (such as health information or criminal record) for the purposes for which it was initially collected, the purposes listed in this privacy policy, other directly-related purposes or purposes to which you otherwise consent.

If at any time you do not wish to receive Toyota Marketing from us or any of the Toyota Family, you may contact us by calling 137 200 or follow the unsubscribe instructions on any Toyota Marketing. You can elect to receive or cease receiving Toyota Marketing at any time by simply calling that number or following the instructions on any Toyota Marketing.

### How do we disclose your personal information?

Where appropriate, we may disclose your personal information to any of the Toyota Family and other third parties who provide

services to us or on our behalf for purposes such as processing a claim, validating and confirming information, administering policies and where customer research is conducted and/or such other purposes as noted below. The types of entities to which and purposes for which we may disclose your personal information include:

  * related entities ( for the management of your policy or if they take over any of our functions or activities as a result of a restructure or otherwise);
  * other insurance companies (such as the life insurers of our finance protection insurance policies) and re-insurers (for example, to confirm your insurance profile);
  * the Toyota Family (including our intermediaries throughout the Toyota network and/or an appointed representative to provide or facilitate the provision of our or their services to you); 
  * our third party Information Technology (IT) and other service providers (such as our mailing house or our lawyers); 
  * any of the Toyota Family in order for them to provide you with Toyota Marketing (if you have consented to receiving it); 
  * your employer;
  * claims/loss assessors, loss adjusters, investigators and recovery agents (for example, when a claim requires assessment or investigation); 
  * repairers, suppliers, medical practitioners, rehabilitation providers and case managers;
  * insurance reference bureaus, data collection and verification agencies and consumer research organisations;
  * the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) (this is an external dispute resolution scheme);
  * a guarantor noted on a finance contract and finance companies (such as Toyota Finance); and
  * government authorities, law enforcement agencies and credit enforcement bodies and agencies (if permitted or required by law).



Some of the entities listed above are located in countries outside of Australia (such as Japan). We will only disclose your sensitive information (such as health information or criminal record) for the purposes for which it was initially collected, the purposes set out in this policy, other directly-related purposes, as permitted by law or purposes to which you otherwise consent.

### Security of your personal information

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information against loss, misuse, interference and unauthorised access, alteration or disclosure. For example, access to the personal information that we store on our systems is subject to the use of secure passwords and identifiers. We also implement reasonable physical security measures.

However, no security measure is completely secure and, despite the procedures we have put in place, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information (particularly in relation to transmissions over the internet).

Any information which you transmit to us is transmitted at your own risk. You must also make sure you protect your personal information, for example, by protecting your usernames, passwords and policy details.

You should notify us as soon as you become aware of any such security breaches.

### How to access and correct your personal information

We take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we collect and hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, we rely on you to advise us about any changes to your personal information to help us maintain accurate, complete and up-to-date information. Please let us know if you think any information we hold about you is not accurate, complete or up-to-date.

On request, we will provide you with access to your personal information that we hold (unless otherwise required or permitted by applicable law). We will notify you of the basis for any denial to access your information.

In most cases, a summary of basic policy information such as your name, address, contact details, policy details or copies of documents such as repair quotations can be requested by phone and will be sent to you.

Although some requests can be made by telephone, for others (such as a relevant assessor’s or investigator’s report) we may need you to complete a written application.

Please contact us on 137 200 if you would like information on how to request access to such information.

There is no charge for making a request.
