** At Toys"R"Us we will only collect your personal information, such as name, address and telephone number or e-mail address, where necessary to provide you with our products and services relevant to you and your family. Personal information may be collected from you in our retail stores, from our website or when dealing with departments located at the Store Support Centre. Privacy law requires us to collect personal information about you only from you if it is reasonable and practical to do so. Generally, you have no obligation to provide any information requested by Toys"R"Us, if you choose not to provide us with requested information however, we may not be able to provide you with those products or services that depend on the collection of that information, particularly if the collection of that information is required by the law. 

**How Personal Information is Used  
** Personal information is usually only requested to allow us to provide our products and services to you. Some examples of where we may need to collect this information from you are credit card purchases in store or through our website, warranties, home deliveries, in store competitions, refunds / exchanges and website promotions or offers. Toys"R"Us may also use your personal information to communicate to you our unique offers, promotions and services. You can advise Toys"R"Us that you do not wish us to send that information to you other than the main use for which we collected your personal information. We may still use or disclose that information if: (i) we subsequently notify you of the intended use or disclosure and you do not object to that use or disclosure; (ii) we believe that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist a law enforcement agency or an agency responsible for government or public security in the performance of their functions; or (iii) we are required by law to disclose the information.
