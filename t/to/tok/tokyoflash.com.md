We hate SPAM as much as anyone else, so we try to keep our emails to a minimum. You can expect to receive 1 email per month from us. (Holiday season Nov/Dec we may send up to 3 a month)

If at anytime, you wish to UNSUBSCRIBE from our email list, you will find an 'unsubscribe' link at the foot of our email newsletter.

We keep a record of your purchase to provide warranty support. If you have a warranty issue, we know exactly when & what you purchased so we can provide a fast and efficient replacement, repair or refund. Our customers satisfaction is top priority.
