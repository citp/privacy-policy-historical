If you wish for the disclosure, notice of the purposes of use, correction, addition, deletion, discontinuance of use, elimination or discontinuance of provision to a third party of any personal information (collectively, "Disclosure, etc."), please contact the below enquiry desk and make a request pursuant to the procedures separately specified by Tokyo 2020\. In such cases, we will ascertain the identity of the person by information which can identify such individual (name, address, telephone number, date of birth, email address, etc.). For further details, please contact the below enquiry desk. Please note, however, that the Disclosure, etc. of personal information will not be made in the following instances: 

  * If the Disclosure, etc. is likely to harm the life, limb or property or any other rights or interests of the person to whom the information pertains or a third party;
  * If the Disclosure, etc. is likely to significantly impede the proper execution of our services; or

Please note that in cases in which a large sum of money or significant resources would be required to discontinue the use of, eliminate or discontinue the provision to a third party of the personal information ("Discontinuance of Use, etc. ") or in cases in which the Discontinuance of Use, etc. of personal information is otherwise difficult, and when necessary alternative measures to protect the rights and interests of the person to whom the personal information pertains, can be put in place, the request for Discontinuance of Use, etc. of personal information may not be complied with unless this would contradict with applicable laws. 

### 7\. Rights for EU residents

If you are a resident in the EU, you also have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal information; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal information; and to obtain the personal information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format (i.e. the right of data portability). In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information under certain conditions. 

These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, where it would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. Relevant exemptions are included in both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and in any local EU laws on privacy. We will inform you of the relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make. 

To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us using the details set out below. If you have any unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU data protection authority where you live or work or where you believe a breach may have occurred. 

### 8\. How long does Tokyo 2020 hold on to personal information?

We will process your information until at least the end of the Games, unless you are entitled to ask us to stop using your information before this point. We may then hold some of your information after the Games as necessary to protect ourselves from legal claims or to meet our legal requirements.
