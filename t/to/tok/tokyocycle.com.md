# Privacy Statement | Tokyo Cycling Club

[ ](http://www.tokyocycle.com/bbs/portal/)

The Tokyo Cycling Club (TCC) does not collect personally identifying information with the sole exception of your specific knowledge and consent thereof. We do not share such information with any third parties, and no third party has access to your stored information.

TCC stores usernames, passwords and email addresses in password protected directories and publicly inaccessible databases. The main website runs on Xenforo which has thorough security protection built in, and is kept rigidly up to date by us. The server the site exists on also has full security built in. All third-party plugins are assured safe by us, and Xenforo themselves

**This site uses cookies. By continuing to browse the site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.**

TCC will never sell or distribute email addresses and/or other personally identifying information to third parties without your explicit permission, nor use it for unapproved commercial purposes. Our policy is to protect the privacy and confidentiality of our visitors and users.

Personal Messages (referred to as 'Conversations' on this site) are absolutely not visible to anybody unless they are explicitly included in the list of recipients, through invitation. There is no way for anybody, including all levels of administration to access the personal messages of another member, unless they are invited into the message specifically. The only time we will access any personal message information is if we are legally required to do so, which will require a direct database extraction.

For your security, TCC only officially supports the latest version of all web browsers.
