# TokBox Privacy Policy

### About TokBox

TokBox is a web-initiated video communications service. TokBox members control, and can change at any time, their personal information that is available to others. 

TokBox cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please contact us in writing by visiting our Contact page. 

### Information Collection and Use by TokBox

TokBox collects user submitted information such as name, email address, phone number, and age to authenticate users and to send notifications to those users relating to the TokBox service. TokBox also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, time zone, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. Such data are used to manage the website, track usage and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to members. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes. 

User information, including members' pictures and user names, are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction. Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join TokBox and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of notifications and invitations, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to others. To facilitate searching and finding interesting content on the service, TokBox may allow users to search for other members using first and last name, email address, and other standard search strategies. We may also use a user's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. From time to time, TokBox or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on TokBox. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply. 

### Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members

TokBox members can invite other people to join the service by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system. TokBox stores the email addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added to the contact's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations. TokBox does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, invitation reminders (up to three (3) per email address). Recipients of invitations from TokBox may contact TokBox to request the removal of their information from our database. 

TokBox members may also store email addresses of people they know in their internal TokBox address book and may also choose to send invitations and other communications to those addresses. You may prevent TokBox email invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address you control by contacting us in writing through our Contact page or by replying to any email message we send you with the words "unsubscribe" in the Subject line.

### Third Party Advertising

Advertisements appearing on our site may be delivered to users by TokBox or one of our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad servers may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by TokBox and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

### Security

TokBox member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. TokBox takes precautions to insure that member account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. For any additional information about the security measures we use on TokBox, please contact us in writing by visiting our Contact page. 

### Sharing and Disclosure of Information TokBox Collects

Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, we will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by TokBox, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the TokBox Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service. TokBox reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of TokBox or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. For more information see the "Changes in Our Privacy Policy" section below. 

### Changes in Our Privacy Policy

From time to time we may make changes to our privacy policy. If we make changes, we will post them on our site(s) to make users aware of what the changes are so users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and when we may disclose it. A User is bound by any minor changes to the policy when she or he uses the site after those changes have been posted. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting a notice on our site for thirty days.
