This personal information will often be provided directly by you, and may include information you provide on registration or in the process of a purchase, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, gender, age and payment details. 

Persons applying to be accredited for the Games will receive specific information regarding the processing of their personal information for the purposes of the accreditation process and more generally in the context of Games preparation, operations and competitions (such as responsible data controllers, data collected, purposes, processing operations, data recipients, conservation, exercise of legal rights etc).
