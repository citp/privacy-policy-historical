<div class="blueText"><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></div>
<br>
<div class="innerText">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond
California
to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to
post a
conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:
http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br></div>

<br>
<div class="innerText">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts
parents in
control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do
to
protect
children's privacy and safety online.<br><br></div>

<div class="innerText">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in
the
development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the
various
privacy
laws that protect personal information.<br><br></div>
<div class="innerText"><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></div>
<div class="innerText">We will notify you via email</div>
<div class="innerText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> Within 7 business days</div>
<div class="innerText"><br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors
and
processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
courts or
government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

<span id="canSpam"></span><br>
<div class="blueText"><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></div>
<br>
<div class="innerText">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails
stopped
from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.<br><br></div>
<div class="innerText"><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></div>
