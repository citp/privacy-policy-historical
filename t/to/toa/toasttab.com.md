  * “Merchants” are businesses that have purchased the Services for use in their establishments.
  * “Merchant Employees” are employees of our Merchants.

 **Automatically Collected Information**

When you visit our websites, we will automatically collect information about you through cookies and similar technologies.

  * Cookies

    * A cookie is a small, unique piece of information placed and saved in your browser when you access our websites or Merchants’ websites, services, content or ads. Cookies help us collect information about your use of the Services over time. Most web and mobile device browsers are set to automatically accept cookies by default. However, you can change your browser settings to prevent automatic acceptance of cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is set.

    * You also can learn more about cookies by visiting http://www.allaboutcookies.org, which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies on different types of browsers and mobile devices. Additionally, on most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please use this help section for information on how to request a notification when you receive a new cookie and how to limit, block or delete cookies. Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used in the Services, you may not be able to use, or take full advantage of, the Services.

    * We use cookies to provide our Services and help collect data. We may use cookies for five main purposes: (1) authentication and sign-in; (2) security and Service integrity; (3) to store your preferences and settings; (4) to analyze how our Services are performing; and (5) provide and improve our Services. We use two types of cookies: session cookies, and persistent cookies. Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the website. Session cookies do not store any Personal Information but contain a unique visitor ID number we use to customize the Services for you. Persistent cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer, even after you leave the website. Persistent cookies do not store Personal Information and are used to remember preferences that should persist from visit to visit.

  * Google Analytics

    * We use third-party analytics tools, including without limitation Google Analytics, to collect information about how Merchants, Diners or our website visitors engage with our Services. The analytics tools use cookies and collect a variety of information, such as demographics, interests, and behaviors based on the information collected, as well as how often Merchants, Diners or website visitors visit particular websites, what pages they visit when they do so, and the websites they used prior to coming to the website. We use the information we get from the analytics tools to provide and improve our Services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics is governed by the Google Analytics Terms of Use (available at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html) and the Google Partner Privacy Policy (available at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to our website by disabling cookies on your browser.
