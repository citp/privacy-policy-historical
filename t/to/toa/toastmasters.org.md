### What personal information do we collect?

When you apply to become a member, we will collect personal data as necessary to register the membership. Typical information required may be your name, postal address, telephone number and email address in order to establish the membership.

We may ask you to provide us with additional information including:

  * Information that you provide by filling in forms on our website. This includes information provided to donate to The Smedley Fund, subscribe to services available on our website, submit a Trademark Use Request, post material or request further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our website.
  * Records and copies of your correspondence (including email addresses), if you contact us.
  * Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes.
  * Details of transactions you carry out through our website and of the fulfillment of your orders. You may be required to provide financial information before placing an order through our website. (Credit card information is always immediately disposed of after the purchase is complete).
  * Your search queries on our website.
  * There may be features that are developed in the future that may result in the collection of additional new information.



For example, you provide information when you search for a product; place an order through our store; provide information to our Member Engagement and Support department; provide information in your personal profile (or profiles, if you have more than one); communicate with us by phone, email, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire; or use other Toastmasters features. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name (or another person's), address, and phone numbers; credit card information; people to whom purchases have been shipped, including addresses and phone number; content of emails to us; personal information (your name and any Toastmasters International honors or awards you’ve received); and financial information.

You can choose not to provide certain information or to have it deleted, by accessing your profile or by contacting our Member Services department, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing your future visits to the Toastmasters website and shopping, improving our website, and communicating with you.

Any information we collect automatically is statistical data, and does not identify any individual. It helps us to improve our website and to deliver a better and more personalized service by enabling us to:

  * Estimate our audience size, browser statistics, and popularity of content and usage patterns.
  * Speed up your searches.
  * Recognize you when you return to our website.



A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at www.toastmasters.org if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own website, <http://www.privacy.ca.gov/>.

They may be able to detect that visitors to their website arrived via [www.toastmasters.org.](https://web.archive.org/web/20181229193042id_/http%3A//www.toastmasters.org/footer/~/link.aspx?_id=110D559FDEA542EA9C1C8A5DF7E70EF9&_z=z) However, we do not receive any information from these or other outside websites regarding your page views, purchases or any other information.

### Does Toastmasters share the information it receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. However, we may share your information for the following purposes:

#### _Toastmasters International:_

This includes the organization’s World Headquarters, which manages [www.toastmasters.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20181229193042id_/http%3A//www.toastmasters.org/footer/~/link.aspx?_id=110D559FDEA542EA9C1C8A5DF7E70EF9&_z=z), as well as Toastmasters districts, divisions, areas and individual Toastmasters clubs. In keeping with our regular offline business practices, Toastmasters International will provide information about Toastmasters members to these internal associates for communication purposes only.

#### _Third-Party Service Providers:_

We may share information with third-party service providers to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, streamlining large emails, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing website data, providing website design assistance, conducting surveys, and processing credit card payments. Third parties may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. All third-parties have been carefully vetted, and when necessary may have signed data protection agreements.

#### _Protection of Toastmasters.org and Others:_

We may release account and other personal information when appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Toastmasters International, our members, or others. This may include exchanging information with civil authorities, other companies and organizations in order to protect Toastmasters International and its members from illegal activities.

You can opt out of receiving non-essential communications via email, postal mail, or telephone. Even if you opt out of getting messages, we will still send you transactional messages such as order confirmations and receipts and communications necessary to further our legitimate business interests.

### How secure is my information?

Toastmasters International is committed to protecting the security of your personal information and maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that meet industry standards to guard your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our website, using firewalls and other security technology to protect our network and systems from external attacks, and requiring you to enter a unique username and password to access your account information online.

When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption. Toastmasters International uses industry-standard (SSL) technology to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing potentially sensitive information, such as your name and address, as well as critically sensitive information like your credit card number that you provide or access during a secure session (look for a padlock or key and chain icon on your browser).

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Certain parts of our website require a password, and you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Passwords, registered with our website, are encrypted to ensure protection against unauthorized access to your personal information. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of our website. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of our website. It is important for you to guard against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
