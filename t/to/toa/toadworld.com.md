# Quest : Privacy

[ ](http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.quest.com&sealid=102)

We at Quest Software recognize the importance of protecting your personal information and we are committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

Because Quest Software respects its customers and understands that you are concerned about privacy, we have instituted policies and security measures intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. We also post this privacy policy so that you can agree to the kind of information we collect, how it is handled, and with whom it may be shared. This privacy policy applies to [www.quest.com](http://www.quest.com/)

By accessing or using the Quest Software Web site, you agree to the terms of this Quest Software Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not access or use this site. Quest Software is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you can email us at [webmaster@quest.com ](mailto:o:webmaster@quest.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry, or if your inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, you can then contact TRUSTe through the TRUSTe Dispute Resolution Process at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>. TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.

### Collection of Personal Information

When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as ordering products, downloading software, obtaining technical support or entering contests, Quest Software may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Quest Software may require that you provide us with personal information, such as your name, title, company, mailing or billing or shipping address, work e-mail address, work phone number and other personal identifying information. When ordering products on the site, you may be asked to provide credit card information.

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Quest Software does not store this information.

### Use of Personal Information 

When you submit personal information to Quest Software, you understand and agree that Quest Software, its subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer, store, and process your customer profile in any of the countries in which Quest Software and its affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. Quest Software abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union.

Quest Software, its affiliates and subsidiaries collect this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select and to provide the products and services on the website. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. You agree that Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries can store and use your information for these purposes, including, if applicable, transferring your data to our third party payment processors. Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries use third party address verification software to verify the address provided is a correct mailing address. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries also use information that you provide as part of our effort to send you information about product upgrades, special offers, and other Quest products and services.

Quest Software recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of this information. If you do not want the information you provide to Quest Software to be used to inform you of other products and special offers, or if you wish to change or modify information previously provided, you can do so by following the procedures set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update Section of this policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties unless we obtain your prior consent. We may, however, share your information with a distributor or partner in your area who can assist with your request for information if Quest does not have its own sales force your area. The distributor or partner may use these details to contact you about the support services that they may offer as well as other Quest products or services that you may be interested in. If you do not want to receive information from our distributors or partners, you may opt out by following the procedures set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update Section of this policy.

### Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. 

### Use of Cookies 

When you visit the Quest Software Web site, you can surf the site anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our site, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)

While Quest Software uses cookies to track your visit to the Quest Software Web site, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided Quest Software with personal information.

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Secure_Socket_Layer.html>.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at [webmaster@quest.com ](mailto:o:webmaster@quest.com).

### Links to Other Web Sites 

The Quest Software site may contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that this privacy statement applies solely to the information collected on the Quest Software site. Quest Software is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you are leaving the Quest Software site and read the privacy statements of the site that you visit prior to providing any personal information.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

As we continue to develop our Web site and take advantage of technologies to improve the service we provide, this policy may change. If this policy does change, we will post the changes here. In addition, if we materially change any of our practices related to the collection and use of personal information, we will either notify users via e-mail or post a prominent notice on our website. After any change, we will also revise the "Page last updated" date at the bottom of the privacy statement. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy and how we are protecting the personal information we collect. 

### Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update
