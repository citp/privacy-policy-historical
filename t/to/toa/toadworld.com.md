# Privacy Policy

We at Quest Software recognize the importance of protecting your personal information and we are committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

Because Quest Software respects its customers and understands that you are concerned about privacy, we have instituted policies and security measures intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. We also post this Privacy Policy so that you can agree to the kind of information we collect, how it is handled, and with whom it may be shared. This Privacy Policy applies to all websites that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Sites").

By accessing or using the Sites, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not access or use the Sites. If you have questions or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [webmaster@quest.com](mailto:webmaster@quest.com).

### Information Gathered

The Sites will gather information such as the type of browser and operating system that visitors are using, their IP address, cookie information, time stamp (the time each page is accessed as well as the amount of time spent per page) and clickstream information (for example, which pages are viewed and how long they have been there). Note that information is only gathered while the visitor is on the Sites. Quest Software monitors how a visitor arrives at the Sites, but cannot and will not gather information about other third party sites that the user has visited. Quest Software automatically receives and records such information on our server logs from your browser.

When you engage in certain activities on the Sites, such as ordering products, downloading software, using certain services, obtaining technical support or entering contests, Quest Software may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Quest Software may require that you provide us with personal information, such as your name, title, company, mailing, billing or shipping address, work e-mail address, work phone number and other personally identifiable information. When ordering products or services on the Sites, you may be asked to provide credit card information.

In certain sections of the Sites, Quest Software may invite you to contact us to pose questions, request information, or complete a registration form. We may ask for personal information to be entered as a means of registration before accessing these sections of the Sites.

### Use of Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information that you provide to Quest within the Sites may be used by Quest to provide you with the products, services and information that you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you, service your accounts, and save you time and better respond to your needs. In addition, we may use your information to verify your authority to enter into certain areas of the Sites, improve the content and general administration of the Sites and our services, provide you with notices regarding our products and services, and, with permission, provide you with updates and information about our products and services.

When you submit personal information to Quest Software, you understand and agree that Quest Software, its subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer, store, and process your information in any of the countries in which Quest Software and its affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. Quest Software complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from the European Union. Information regarding the E.U. Safe Harbor Framework can be found at: <http://export.gov/safeharbor>.

Quest Software, its affiliates and subsidiaries collect this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select and to provide the products and services on the Sites. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrades, or other benefits that may be made available to registered customers. You agree that Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries can store and use your information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, including, if applicable, transferring your data to our third party payment processors. Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries use third party address verification software to verify the address provided is a correct mailing address. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries also use information that you provide as part of our effort to send you information about product upgrades, special offers, and other Quest products and services.

Quest Software recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of this information. If you do not want the information you provide to Quest Software to be used to inform you of other products and special offers, or if you wish to change or modify information previously provided, you can do so by following the procedures set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update Section of this policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties unless we obtain your prior consent. We may, however, share your information with a distributor or partner in your area who can assist with your request for information if Quest does not have its own sales force in your area. The distributor or partner may use these details to contact you about the support services that they may offer as well as other Quest products or services that you may be interested in. If you do not want to receive information from our distributors or partners, you may opt out by following the procedures set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update Section of this policy.

### Use of Personally Identifiable Information

Quest Software may disclose your personally identifiable information without prior notice to you if we believe we are required to do so by law, court order, subpoena from a court with proper jurisdiction, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation by a governmental authority or agency. Only information requested or described will be disclosed as directed pursuant to the law, subpoena or court order. Subject to our legal obligations, Quest Software will notify customers of the information request as allowed by the law, subpoena or court order.

### Log Files

As is true of most web sites, the Sites gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the Sites, to track users' movements around the Sites and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

In addition, we use Third-Party Tracking Services that use tracking technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Sites in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics.

### Use of Cookies

When you visit the Sites, you can surf the Sites anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Sites, we use "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)

While Quest Software uses cookies to track your visit to the Sites, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided Quest Software with personally identifiable information.

Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Sites. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Quest Software only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party. See the Third Party Tracking Services section of this Privacy Policy for additional information.

### Web Beacons (Clear Gifs/Web Bugs)

Some pages on the Sites may also use "Web beacon" technologies. When a visitor accesses pages on the Sites with a Web beacon, an anonymous notice of that visit is generated that may be processed by Quest or Quest's vendors. These Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of our Sites are of interest to our visitors and to help us provide you with tailored information from our Sites.

If you turn off cookies, Web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other anonymous information or personally identifiable information and are disregarded.

If you use a bulletin board, testimonial, chat room, and/or communities on the Sites, you should be aware that any information, including personally identifiable information, that you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. For testimonials, we obtain the customer's consent prior to posting their name along with their testimonial. We are not responsible for the information that you choose to submit in these forums. If you want to remove your personal information that is being displayed on our Sites under public pages, please contact us at [webmaster@quest.com](mailto:webmaster@quest.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

### Referral Service

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Sites, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Sites. Quest Software does not store this information.

### Jive Software

Quest Software uses Jive Software to serve the Quest Software Community located at [http://communities.quest.com](http://communities.quest.com/). Use of the Quest Software Community is covered via this Privacy Policy; however some provisions of the Jive Software Privacy Policy may also apply.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Secure_Socket_Layer.html>.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Sites, you can email us at [webmaster@quest.com](mailto:webmaster@quest.com).

### Links to Other Web Sites

The Sites may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected on the Sites and to no other web sites. Quest Software is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you are leaving the Sites and read the privacy statements of the site that you visit prior to providing any personal information.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

As we continue to develop our Sites and take advantage of technologies to improve the services that we provide, this Privacy Policy may change. If this Privacy Policy does change, we will post the changes here. In addition, if we materially change any of our practices related to the collection and use of personally identifiable information, we will either notify users via e-mail or post a prominent notice on our Sites. After any change, we will also revise the "Page last updated" date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. We therefore encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy and how we are protecting the personal information we collect.

### Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update

Upon receipt of your request, your information will be removed or updated as soon as possible, but no later than ten (10) days after our receipt of your request. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [listmaster@quest.com](mailto:listmaster@quest.com). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
