# Privacy Policy

Quest Software, Inc. ("Quest") recognizes the importance of protecting your personal information and is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. 

Because Quest respects its customers and understands that you are concerned about privacy, Quest has instituted policies and security measures intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. We also post this privacy policy so that you can agree to the kind of information we collect, how it is handled, and with whom it may be shared. This privacy policy applies to Quest Software User Community and its marketing, sales and support initiatives. 

By accessing or using this Web site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not access or use this site. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you can email us at [communities@quest.com](mailto:communities@quest.com). 

**Collection of Personal Information**  
When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as ordering products, downloading software, obtaining technical support or entering contests, Quest may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Quest may require that you provide us with personal information, such as your name, title, company, mailing or billing or shipping address, work e-mail address, work phone number and other personal identifying information. When ordering products on the site, you may be asked to provide credit card information. 

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Quest does not store this information. 

**Use of Personal Information**  
When you submit personal information to Quest, you understand and agree that Quest, its subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer, store, and process your customer profile in any of the countries in which Quest, its subsidiaries and affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. Quest Software, Inc., abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union. 

Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries collect this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select and to provide the products and services on the website. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. You agree that Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries can store and use your information for these purposes, including, if applicable, transferring your data to our third party payment processors. Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries use third party address verification software to verify the address provided is a correct mailing address. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Quest, its affiliates and subsidiaries also use information that you provide as part of our effort to send you information about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services. 

Quest recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of this information. If you do not want the information you provide to Quest to be used to inform you of other products and special offers, or if you wish to change or modify information previously provided, you can do so by following the procedures set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update Section of this policy. Quest does not sell your personal information to third parties without prior consent. Quest may, however, share your information with a distributor or partner in your area who can assist with your request for information if Quest does not have its own sales force in your area. The distributor or partner may use these details to contact you about the support services that they may offer as well as other Quest products or services that you may be interested in. If you do not want to receive information from our distributors or partners, you may opt out by following the procedures set forth in the Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update Section of this policy. 

**Log Files**  
As is true of most Web sites, Quest gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

Quest uses this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Quest does not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. 

**Use of Cookies**  
When you visit the Quest user community Web site, you can surf the site anonymously and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our site, Quest uses "cookies" to track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, recording your passwords, purchases, and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.) 

While Quest uses cookies to track your visit to the Quest User Community Web site, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided Quest with personal information. 

Quest reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the Quest User Community Web site. 

**Message Board Rules and Terms of Use**  
Considering the real-time nature of this bulletin board, it is impossible for Quest to review messages or confirm the validity of information posted by users. Please remember that Quest does not actively monitor the contents of posted messages and are not responsible for any messages posted. Quest does not vouch for or warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any message, and are not responsible for the contents of any message. The messages express the views of the author of the message, not necessarily the views of this bulletin board or any entity associated with this bulletin board. Any user who feels that a posted message is objectionable is encouraged to contact us immediately by email at [communities@quest.com](mailto:communities@quest.com). Quest has the ability to remove objectionable messages and we will make every effort to do so, within a reasonable time frame, if Quest determines that removal is necessary. This is a manual process, however, so please realize that Quest may not be able to remove or edit particular messages immediately. 

You agree, through your use of this service, that you will not use this bulletin board to post any material(s) which is knowingly false and/or defamatory, inaccurate, abusive, vulgar, hateful, harassing, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, invasive of a person's privacy, or otherwise violative of any law. You agree not to post any copyrighted material unless the copyright is owned by you or by this bulletin board. 

Although this bulletin board does not and cannot review the messages posted and is not responsible for the content of any of these messages, we at this bulletin board reserve the right to delete any message for any or no reason whatsoever. You remain solely responsible for the content of your messages, and you agree to indemnify and hold harmless this bulletin board, the makers of the bulletin board software, and their agents with respect to any claim based upon transmission of your message(s). 

We at this bulletin board also reserve the right to reveal your identity (or whatever information we know about you) in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from any message posted by you. 

Please note that advertisements, chain letters, pyramid schemes, and solicitations are inappropriate on this bulletin board and are expressly forbidden. 

If you use the bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Quest is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 

**Security**  
The security of your personal information is important to Quest. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on Quest registration or order forms, Quest encrypts that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this link: www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Secure_Socket_Layer.html . 

Quest follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once Quest receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while Quest strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, Quest cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email inquiries to [communities@quest.com](mailto:communities@quest.com). 

**Links to Other Web Sites**  
The Quest User Community site may contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that this privacy statement applies solely to the information collected on the Quest User Community site. Quest is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you are leaving the Quest User Community site and read the privacy statements of the site that you visit prior to providing any personal information. 

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**  
As Quest continues to develop the Quest User Community Web site and take advantage of technologies to improve the service provided, this policy may change. If this policy does change, Quest will post the changes here. In addition, if Quest materially change practices related to the collection and use of personal information, Quest will either notify users via e-mail or post a prominent notice on the Quest User Community Web site. After any change, Quest will also revise the "Page last updated" date at the bottom of the privacy statement. Quest therefore encourages you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand Quest Software's current privacy policy and how Quest is protecting the personal information collected on the Quest User Community Web site. 

**Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update**  
If you would like to remove your information from our database or not receive future communications, or wish to change or modify information previously provided please contact us at [communities@quest.com](mailto:communities@quest.com). Upon receipt of your request, your information will be removed or updated as soon as possible, but no later than ten (10) days after receipt of your request.
