### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, the Company collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The Company's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how the Site's visitors, users and/or subscribers (generically referred to in this Privacy and Cookies Policy as "visitor" or "visitors")use the Site. From time to time, the Company may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

The Company also collects Personal Data (Personal Data, Data Controller and Data Processor shall have the same meaning as in the Spanish Organic Law 15/1999, on Personal Data Protection - the Data Protection Law-) such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the Site. The Company only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses Personal Data as described below.

### Gathering of Personal Data

Certain visitors to the Site choose to interact with the Site in ways that require the Company to gather Personal Data from them in which case the Company will be deemed as being the Data Controller of such Personal Data.

For example, visitors who sign up at _[the Site](http://www.toastedballs.com/)_ are asked to provide a username and email address. In each case, the Company collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with the Site and/or the Company.
