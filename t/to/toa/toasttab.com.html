Information we receive about you
</h2>
<div>
<p>
We receive a number of different types of information about you, including:
</p>
<h4>
Your information
</h4>
<p>
Your information is the information that's required when you sign up for the site, as well as the information you choose to share.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Registration information</strong> - When you sign up for Toast, you are required to provide your name, email address, photo, and payment card.
  </li>
  <li>
	<strong>Information you choose to share</strong> - Your information also includes the optional information you choose to provide to Toast, such as your gender or birthday. It also includes the information you choose to share when you take an action, such as when you make a payment or share your experience at a merchant. 
  </li></ul>

<p>
Your birthday and gender allows us to do things like show you age or gender-appropriate content and advertisements.
</p>

<h4>
Other information we receive about you
</h4>
<p>
We also receive other types of information about you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
We receive data about you whenever you interact with Toast, such as when you search for a merchant, view a merchant, make a payment, purchase a voucher, or comment on a post.
  </li>
  <li>
When you post things like photos on Toast, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the photo.
  </li>
  <li>
We receive data from the computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access Toast. This may include your IP address, location, the type of browser you use, or the pages you visit. For example, we may get your GPS location so we determine if you are near any merchants that use Toast.
  </li>
  <li>
We receive data from Facebook that helps us make your experience more interactive and helps us better deliver more relevant deals and promotions.  For example, we receive your comments or likes related to a post from the Toast application, and display these comments for other customers or potential customers of our merchants to make better decisions about choosing to buy there.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
We also put together data from the information we already have about you and your friends. We may put together your current city with GPS and other location information we have about you to, for example, tell you and your friends about deals that you might be interested in.
</p>
<p>
When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city). But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services.
</p>
<p>
We only provide data to our merchant partners or customers after we have removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. Similarly, when we receive data about you from our merchant partners or customers, we keep the data for 180 days. After that, we combine the data with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you.
</p>
</div>
<h2 id="public-info">
Public information
</h2>
<p>
When we use the phrase "public information" (which we sometimes refer to as "Everyone information"), we mean the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available.
</p>
<h4>
Information that is always publicly available
</h4>
<p>
The types of information listed below are always publicly available, and are treated just like information you decided to make public.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
	<strong>Name</strong> - This helps merchants find and identify you, and is important for security.  It also helps your friends and family find you.
  </li><li>
	<strong>Profile Picture</strong> - This helps merchants recognize you. 
  </li>
  <li>
	<strong>Deal Posts</strong> - The posts you make to Facebook are always public for other Toast users.  This allows other users to view your comments about a particular merchant to make better decisions on whether to visit that merchant. 
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="info-use">
How we use the information we receive
</h2>
<p>
We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, and the merchants that partner with us. For example, we may use the information we receive about you:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
as part of our efforts to keep Toast safe and secure;
  </li>
  <li>
to provide you with location features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is going on nearby;
  </li>
  <li>
to measure or understand the effectiveness of promotions you and others see;
  </li>
  <li>
to make suggestions to you and other users on Toast, such as: suggesting that you share a deal on Facebook because other friends of yours have accepted deals shared by your friends.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Granting us this permission not only allows us to provide Toast as it exists today, but it also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
While you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't share information we receive about you with others unless we have:
  </li>
  <li>
received your permission;
  </li>
  <li>
given you notice, such as by telling you about it in this policy; or
  </li>
  <li>
removed your name or any other personally identifying information from it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="account-deletion">
Deactivating and deleting your account		
</h2>
<p>If you want to stop using your account, you can either <strong>deactivate</strong> or <strong>delete</strong> it.</p>
<h4>Deactivation</h4>
<p>
Deactivating your account puts your account on hold. Other users will no longer see your content (e.g. posts, images), but we do not delete any of your information. Deactivating an account is the same as you telling us not to delete any information because you might want to reactivate your account at some point in the future.
You can deactivate your account on your account settings page.
</p>
<h4>Deletion</h4>
<p>
When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Toast. It typically takes about one month to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for up to 90 days. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it.
You can delete your account by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@toasttab.com">info@toasttab.com</a>.
