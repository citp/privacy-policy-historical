Through our Cookies and Tracking Technologies policy, we provide opt-out choices. &nbsp;The effect of an opt-out will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics, and internal online services operation purposes). &nbsp; 11. MOBILE APPS &nbsp; For more information about our information collection and use practices with respect to online services that are mobile applications (“Mobile Apps”) see the Mobile Apps policy. &nbsp; 12. APPLYING TO WORK AT NBCUNIVERSAL&nbsp; &nbsp; When you apply to work at NBCUniversal your information will be collected and used in accordance with the Candidate Privacy Statement.&nbsp; &nbsp; 13.&nbsp;IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS&nbsp; Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third parties to which our online service has disclosed certain personal information (as defined by California law) during the preceding year for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. &nbsp;If you are a California resident and want such a list, please contact us at Chief Privacy Officer, NBCUniversal Legal Department, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112, US. For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. &nbsp;In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. &nbsp;You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. &nbsp;Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, email, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information. Do Not Track California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how NBCUniversal responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. NBCUniversal does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created. &nbsp; 14.&nbsp;LINKS TO OTHER ONLINE SERVICES &nbsp; Our online services may contain links to third party websites/services for your convenience and/or information (for example, to sites which are provided by our third party vendors). &nbsp;If you access other online services using the links provided, you may leave NBCUniversal’s online services. When you access these other sites, even ones that may contain the NBCUniversal logo, please understand that the operators of these websites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policies and Terms of Use, which may differ from ours. We do not endorse or control the policies or practices of third party websites that we do not control or operate. &nbsp; You should always carefully read the privacy policy of any website you access in order to understand their specific privacy and information usage practices. &nbsp; &nbsp; 15.&nbsp;UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY&nbsp; &nbsp; From time to time, we may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives, changes in the law or technology, or changes in our practices regarding information collection and use. &nbsp;If we make material revisions to the way we collect or use your personal information so that we are using it for purposes or sharing data with third parties that you have not consented to, we will provide you with notice of those changes and may do so by either: &nbsp;(1) announcing the change on the home page of our websites or (2) taking other actions as we deem appropriate under the circumstances, including without limitation, posting the revised version of this Privacy Policy online. You agree that we may notify you about material changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on our online services. You should check our online services frequently for updates. &nbsp; You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” or similar legend at the top of this page. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective upon posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Internet, accessible through this site. By continuing to use this online service following such changes, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time, in whole or in part, please do not continue to use our online services. &nbsp; 16.

<p><strong>13</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS&nbsp;<a class="anchor" id="links_to_other_online_services" name="links_to_other_online_services"></a></strong></p>
<p>Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third parties to which our online service has disclosed certain personal information (as defined by California law) during the preceding year for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. &nbsp;If you are a California resident and want such a list, please contact us at Chief Privacy Officer, NBCUniversal Legal Department, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112, US. For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. &nbsp;In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. &nbsp;You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. &nbsp;Please note that we will not accept requests via the telephone, email, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do Not Track</strong></em></p>
<p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how NBCUniversal responds to “Do Not Track” browser settings. NBCUniversal does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>
