Our goal is to collect and use information to deliver effective and personalized services which take your interests and preferences into account, as well as for our legitimate business needs and interests.

There are two main types of information we collect about our online users:

    * **_Information that identifies you_** **:  **This is commonly referred to as “personal information” and includes, for example, information that you provide to us such as your name, home address, age, gender, telephone number, e-mail address, payment information (including your credit card number), and/or photos or video footage of you; and **  
**
    * **_Information that relates to you, but on its own does not identify you_** _:_  Such as information about your Internet connection, the equipment you use to access our online services and information relating to your usage of those services.

There are six main categories of information we collect about our online services users that include (but are not limited to) the following:

If you don’t want a social network to collect the information about you as described above, or you don’t want to a social network to share it with us and other third parties, please review the privacy settings and instructions of the applicable social network before you visit and use our online services.

_Information shared among NBCUniversal affiliates._

    * **_When you choose to register for an account on any NBCUniversal online service_** **:  **the information you provide may be shared with NBCUniversal affiliates and used to help us better tailor our services, products and advertising to you. Note that you may be registered for different accounts with different NBCUniversal group companies or in different areas of our business. Please visit the account settings page of the applicable online service if you wish you “de-register” from your account or for more information, or e-mail [privacy@nbcuni.com](mailto:privacy@nbcuni.com).

_

_Information shared with trusted third parties:_

    * **_Service providers or   ** _business partners that  _**we have retained to perform certain business-related functions on our behalf:_** Such as for hosting websites, fulfilling transactions, maintaining databases, administering contests, providing technology services and platforms, and processing payments.  These parties are provided only with the personal information or other information they need to perform their functions and can only use and disclose that information as is necessary to perform the services on our behalf, or to comply with legal requirements. We take steps to ensure that third-party service providers will take appropriate steps to protect your personal information.
    * **_Social Networks_** : You may interact with certain features of the online services that cause information to be published to your social networks.  For example, you may click on a Facebook “like” button, which publishes to your Facebook account that you “like” one of our TV shows or movies.  On pages of the online services that contain social network functionality, the social network providing the functionality may be able to collect information about you, even if you don’t use that functionality. For example, if a page within the online services contains a Facebook “like” button, Facebook may be able to collect data about your visit to that page, even if you don’t click on the “like” button. To control this sharing of information, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network and/or log out of it before you use the online services.
    * **_For Mobile Apps:_**  In addition, in relation to [Mobile Apps](https://web.archive.org/privacy/mobile-apps/) we may share your usage and personal information with operating system, platforms providers, carriers and/or other mobile apps either operated by us or third parties. Please see our Mobile Apps section for additional detail. 

_Information we share with advertisers (including Targeted Advertising)_

Some online services, including Mobile Apps, may be supported with advertising, and collect data to help the online services serve ads.  This helps keep the cost of online services low or free.

We may work with advertisers and third-party advertising networks, who may receive information about how you interact with advertising provided in the online service.  We may also work with consumer data resellers that buy and/or sell information to other companies for multiple purposes including offering products and services that may interest you. These third parties may view, edit or set their own tracking technologies/cookies.  The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. They might also obtain information about other applications that you have downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit and other information about you or your device in order to analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the online services and elsewhere. For information about your choices relating to these activities, see [Cookies and Tracking Technologies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/cookies/).

_Information shared with other parties_

In addition, we may disclose your personal information collected through the online services to law enforcement agencies, government/regulatory bodies, and content protection organizations to:

    * Protect our legal rights, privacy or safety, and those of our subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, agents and contractors or other individuals;
    * Protect the safety and security of visitors to our online services or other properties;
    * Protect against fraud or other illegal activity or for risk management purposes;
    * Respond to inquiries or requests from government, regulatory, law enforcement or public authorities;
    * Permit us to pursue available remedies, commence, participate in, or defend litigation, or limit the damages that we may sustain;

We will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with reasonable notice of such transfer, or as otherwise required by law. If you do not want your personal information to be processed following such a transfer, you should contact the subsequent owner of the business.

  6. ## CHILDREN

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time with their children online and to be fully familiar with the online services used by their children. Except where otherwise indicated we do not knowingly collect or store any personal information from children under the age of 13.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child (who is under 13) has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@nbcuni.com](mailto:privacy@nbcuni.com). We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.

  7. ## HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

We maintain procedural, technical and physical safeguards for our online services to help protect against loss, misuse or unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personal information you provide on our online services.  We also ask the service providers that help us deliver our online services to so the same.  For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our online services.  Unfortunately, no transmission of data is guaranteed to be completely secure.  It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully.  Therefore, any transmission of personal information to us is made at your own risk.  If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please notify us using the contact details below.

NBCUniversal is based in the United States and may from time to time transfer your personal information to other countries and make it accessible to any of our affiliates and third-party service providers internationally.
