### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, TodaysMeet collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TodaysMeet's purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying information is to better understand how TodaysMeet's visitors use its website. From time to time, TodaysMeet may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, ie: "30% of our users use Internet Explorer".

TodaysMeet also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. TodaysMeet does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to TodaysMeet's website choose to interact with TodaysMeet in ways that require TodaysMeet to gather some personally-identifying and potentially personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TodaysMeet gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, when you post a message in a room, we ask for a name. In each case, TodaysMeet collects information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with TodaysMeet. TodaysMeet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

TodaysMeet may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. For example, TodaysMeet may monitor the most popular public rooms. TodaysMeet may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, TodaysMeet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using TodaysMeet's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TodaysMeet will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, TodaysMeet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when TodaysMeet believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TodaysMeet, its owner, third parties, or the public at large. If you send TodaysMeet a request (for example via a support e-mail or feedback mechanism) we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
