# App.net - Privacy Policy

####  Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are very important documents that apply to your use of App.net. The versions currently in effect are preliminary.

If you'd like to work with us to improve these documents, please do so via our [terms-of-service GitHub repo.](https://github.com/appdotnet/terms-of-service)

This is our privacy policy. We are working on making it engaging, but, for now, here is the lowdown as to how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by App.net. Our privacy policy applies to information we collect when you use our website located at http://app.net, use the App.net development tools and social networking services or just interact with us.

We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you access our services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
