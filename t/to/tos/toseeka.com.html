      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	   <h2>Last Updated: March 7, 2010</h2>
   	<p>Generally ToseekA.com  ("Site" or "we", "our" or "us") does not collect, store, use or disclose any  data collected with an intention to identify and/or contact a person such as:  name, address, telephone number or e-mail address (hereinafter "PII"). </p>
       <p>ToseekA.com is owned by ValueClick Brands, Inc. ("ValueClick Brands"). For ToseekA.com, privacy is a top priority and we provide this Privacy Policy to outline our practices and procedures with respect to information collection and use to enable you to make an informed decision about sharing information with us. </p>
       <p class="privacy">What does this Privacy Policy cover?</p>
       <p>This Privacy Policy  applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by us.</p>
       <p> Please be aware that, as part of the service provided by this Site, we may  provide links to websites operated by third parties. We are not responsible for  the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third  party Web sites or applications. You should check the applicable privacy  policies of such third-party Web sites or applications to determine how they  handle any information they collect from you.</p>
       <p class="privacy">What information does ToseekA.com collect and how is it used? Does ToseekA.com  disclose information to third parties? </p>
    <p>We may collect any or all  of the following three types of information: (i) traffic or clickstream data, or  (ii) non-personally identifiable information (for example: IP address, browser  types, operating systems, domain names, access dates and times, referring  website addresses, online transactions and browsing and search activity)  ("Non-PII"). Our collection and use of each type of data is described below, as  well as the ways (if any) in which the data may be shared with third parties or  subsidiaries or affiliates of ValueClick Brands ("ValueClick Brands Entities").</p>
       <p> (a) Traffic or Clickstream Data ("Clickstream Data"). Clickstream Data consists  of traffic and usage data that is not personally identifiable.&nbsp; We do not supplement or combine Clickstream  Data with any PII. We may share Clickstream Data we collect with certain  selected third parties and ValueClick Brands Entities, but only in anonymous form. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, such third parties and ValueClick Brands Entities may combine such  Clickstream Data with any PII that you choose to give to such third parties or  ValueClick Brands Entities when registering with their websites. We collect Clickstream  Data regarding use of our services by observing browser functions and the files  (pages) you access. For example, our servers collect information about the site  to which you may redirect to in order to enable us to calculate and receive  payments from our business partners. In addition, we may use Clickstream Data  to better design our services.</p>
       <p> (b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information.&nbsp;  As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience  for all users of the Site, we may use log files, web beacons and cookies to  collect Non-PII from the Site, browsers, advertisers and third-party  sites.&nbsp; "Log files" track actions  occurring on the Site and collect data including: your IP address, browser  type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time  stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed.&nbsp; "Web beacons" are electronic files  used to track your navigation of a website or collection of sites, the  completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.&nbsp; "Cookies" are files (e.g. flash  browser objects) that are stored on your Internet enabled device (which includes  your computer, BlackBerry or other PDA). Cookies are used to improve the  experience web users have when they see web advertisements and ensure that when  a web user clicks on an advertisement, they are sent to the correct  click-through destination. We may use Cookies for purposes which may include,  without limitation, to estimate the total reach of any of our advertisers, how  frequently you return to the Site, as well as to streamline experiences of  users of our Site. Cookies are also an anonymous way to survey how we are doing  and to look for ways to improve our services.&nbsp;  All information collected by Cookies, Web beacons and Log files are Non-PII.</p>
       <p>There  are two classes of Cookies based on how long they remain on your system:&nbsp; (i) "Session Cookies" may be used only during  your visit to the Site and are erased once you close your browser, and (ii)  "Persistent Cookies" (if applicable) remain on your browser for one (1) year  from your last visit to the Site and enable us to remember you on subsequent  visits to the Site and provide more relevant content to you on such Site. </p>
       <p> There  are many misconceptions about Cookies, some of which we will try to address in  this policy. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your  computer and do not tell us an e-mail address or any other PII. We do not and  cannot use Cookies or web beacons to retrieve PII from your computer.&nbsp; </p>
       <p> A useful resource on  understanding Cookies may be found at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
       <p> (c)&nbsp; Third Party Advertising.&nbsp; We have relationships with third-party  advertising companies to drive traffic to and to serve ads on our Site.&nbsp; We share Clickstream Data and Non-PII with  such advertising companies.&nbsp; Such  companies may also collect non-personally identifiable information through the  use of Cookies and other technology and any personally identifiable information  you may choose to give in registering and transacting with any website linked  to such ads.Although we choose our  business partners and clients carefully, we are not responsible for the privacy  practices of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy  policies of these third-party advertisers to determine how they handle any  information they collect from you.</p>
       <p class="privacy">Do I have choices?</p>
       <p>We also offer "opt-out Cookies" to block the placement of future  ValueClick Brands Persistent Cookies on your system for one thousand (1,000) days from  the time you opted out. If you have multiple internet browsers or users on the  same computer, you will need to perform the opt-out operation for each browser  and/or user. If you or your privacy software deletes the opt-out Cookies from  your computer, you will need to repeat the process. Alternatively, most  internet browsers and browser add-ons allow you to adjust their settings to  allow you to automatically refuse Cookies either generally or from specific  sites.&nbsp;To adjust these settings, we suggest that you contact the supplier  of you browser and browser add-ons for more information.</p>

		<p>Please  note that the above link for opt-out Cookies is only applicable to ValueClick Brands owned  websites using Persistent Cookies and not any other company website.&nbsp; Also, please note that use of the opt-out  Cookies or implementation of browser settings and add-ons that refuse all  cookies will affect our ability to provide you content and advertisements that  will more effectively match your interests and may prevent us from controlling  the frequency with which you may view any particular advertisement.&nbsp; "Session Cookies" are used only during your  visit to the Site and are erased once you close your browser.</p>

		<p>We may find it necessary  or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When  we do, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and the date the Privacy Policy  was last updated on this page so that you are always aware of the information  we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.&nbsp; We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy  whenever you use this Site to make sure you understand how your information  will be used.
