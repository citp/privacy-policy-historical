                <strong>The expense data</strong> is obviously kept so you have logs about what, when and how much you have spent.
                Based on that we can also draw graphs and produce other statistics about your spending that you may find of interest.<br>
                <strong>Local settings</strong> are kept so we can properly display and maintain your expenses according to your local customs.<br>
                <strong>Mobile device name &amp; IMEI</strong> are kept so we have a unique identifier of your mobile device to enable syncing
                and prevent conflicts of data between different devices.<br>
                <strong>Date of the last sync</strong> is kept so we can warn you to keep your data up to date and know which data is latest.
            </p>

                We reserve the right to conduct anonymous analysis and processing of the expense data stored on the site.
