Torpedo7 has put together the following privacy statement to display Torpedo7s commitment to provide privacy. This document will display the policies Torpedo7 has put in place to protect customers during information gathering practices.

### Use of your information

Torpedo7 **does not** sell or rent your personal information to third parties.

We will only release account and other personal information if we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; facilitate court proceedings; enforce or apply our terms and conditions; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Torpedo7 Limited, our users, or others.

### Email

It is the policy of Torpedo7 to send our members emails throughout the purchasing process and other Newsletter emails they elect to receive. Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, Torpedo7 will send out promotional material to its Newsletters subscribers promoting material related to Torpedo7.

We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to [email us](mailto:info@torpedo7.com) with your questions or comments.

### Emailing Tools

Torpedo7 provides tools on its website to tell a friend about products, and send out wish lists. These tools must not be misused in any way to send spam or other content which would violate our privacy policy or Terms and Conditions. We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email messages or the email addresses.

### Membership Registration

Our site's registration form requires you to provide us contact information and may also require demographic information. Your contact information may be used to contact you when necessary.

### Updating Your Personal Information

Torpedo7 provides you with ways in which you can alter your personal data, including changing your email address, password, phone number, etc.

### Delivery Address Details

Torpedo7 enables you to save one delivery address which we will store against your profile. When you buy an item you have the option of entering a new delivery address which must be your own.

### Control of Your Password

You are responsible for all actions taken with your user name, email address and password. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your Torpedo7 password to any third parties. If you choose to share your user name, email address and password or your information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with this information and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.

### Credit Card Security

We work diligently to protect the security of your personal information, including credit card information.

Your credit card details do not get processed or transmitted through or via Torpedo7s website; all transactions are processed through a secure payment service provider. Torpedo7 uses Direct Payment Solutions (DPS) to provide this service. DPS hosts and manages the payment page. All transaction sessions are stored and processed in encrypted strings.

Your credit card details are not held by Torpedo7 and cannot be accessed by Torpedo7 staff. However they may be held by Direct Payment Solutions (DPS) ([review their Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/content/privacy.html)). **Torpedo7 Vouchers** Torpedo7 provides the facilities to present and redeem vouchers through the checkout system. Any voucher is to be used at the discretion of Torpedo7. Torpedo7 also holds the right to terminate any Voucher which they believe is being misused. **Torpedo7 Sponsorship Program** Clicking on “Sponsorship” enables you to view the Torpedo7 sponsorship criteria and information about the application process. Torpedo7 will hold any relevant applications for reviewing.

### Job applications

The "Jobs at Torpedo7" feature enables you to view currently available job opportunities. If you submit a job application, we will email your application directly to the department listing the job. We may hold job applications on file for the purposes of contacting you if future job opportunities arise.

### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use our Web site. We use cookies to improve the user experience. Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites.

Torpedo7 mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer 20min after you leave Torpedo7. A second cookie is placed on your computer (if you choose) for Torpedo7 to remember you, this cookie is intended to remain forever. These are used so our website can remember that you have logged in already and prevent you doing so more frequently.

### Other information we collect

We collect and use additional information to carry out internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails, live chats or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

### Membership Removal

If you wish to have your registration removed from our directory for any reason, simply send us an email requesting to be removed.

### Access and removal of Information

When you request changes to your Torpedo7 subscription, it can take up to five days for changes to take effect.
