    RUNIC GAMES, INC. PRIVACY POLICY<br>
    <em>Last updated November 12, 2012</em>
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="section_header">Our Privacy Commitment</p>
<p>
Runic Games, Inc. ("<strong>Runic</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>") is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the Runic websites where this Privacy Policy is posted (the "<strong>Site(s)</strong>") (we refer to the Site(s), the services and the video games made available through the Site(s), collectively, as the "<strong>Runic Features</strong>").  As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site(s) and users of the Runic Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site(s).  By visiting the Site(s) or using any of the Runic Features, you consent to Runic's collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site(s) and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site(s) which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.
</p>
<p>
This policy answers the following questions:
</p><ul class="legal_indent_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</li>
  <li>Will we share your personal information with third parties?</li>
  <li>What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</li>
  <li>What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="section_header">

</p>

The disclosure of such information is goverened by each digital distributor's privacy policy, and you should review each such privacy policy to understand how each digital distributor collects, uses and discloses your information.  Any such information that we receive from digital distributors shall be governed by this Privacy Policy.
</p>

We also use your e-mail address to send you messages about the Runic Features and other general announcements.  
</p>
<p>

<p>
In addition, we will share the personal information we collect from you under the following circumstances:
</p><ul class="legal_indent_2" style="list-style-type: disc;">
  <li>Protection of rights.

  <li>Asset transfers.  If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of Runic's assets, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the Runic Features, could be included in the transferred assets.  Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you, either through email and/or a prominent notice on the Site(s).</li>
  <li>Service Providers.  We may share your personal information with service providers that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf.  For example, we have partnered with other companies to maintain or manage the Runic Features and our video games, fulfilling product orders and processing payments.

  <li>Publishing Partners.  We may share your email address with our publishing partner, Perfect World Entertainment, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, "<strong>Perfect World</strong>") for the purpose of notifying you about our products and services, including, but not limited to, contests, promotions, or special events and offers related to the Runic Features that Perfect World provides.  To the extent applicable, we require Perfect World to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of third party websites linked to the Site(s). Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal information.  You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, use and disclosure policies.  
</p>
<p>
When you have clicked on an advertisement or third party logo displayed on our Site(s) which links you to a different website, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the owner of that website to see how your personal information will be handled.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p class="section_header">What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</p>

<p>
You may update or delete your personal information or modify your account preferences for the Runic Features by accessing the "My Account" area of the Runic Features.

<p><strong>Mediation</strong></p>
<p>
If you are a resident of a country outside of the European Union, you also agree that, in the event any dispute or claim arises out of or relating to this Privacy Policy that you and Runic will attempt in good faith to negotiate a written resolution of the matter directly between the parties.  You agree that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days after notification (via certified mail or personal delivery) that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation services in Seattle, Washington with a mutually agreed mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute.  Should you file any arbitration claims, or any administrative or legal actions without first having attempted to resolve the matter by mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to recover attorney's fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled to them.
</p>
<p><strong>Dispute Resolution for Residents of the European Union</strong></p>
<p>
If you are a resident of the European Union, in the event that you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, you may report your claim to the European Union Data Protection Authorities located in your jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p class="section_header">What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</p>
<p>
The personal information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information.  In addition, we restrict access to personal information to Runic employees, independent contractors and agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the Runic Features.  All Runic personnel who have access to this information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information.  However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of any of the Runic Features and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk.  Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.
</p>
