		www.Tor.com blogs, forums and discussion boards are a free service to enable you to share comments about the books, articles and other content available on our site. These forums connect you with other www.Tor.com fans and registrants and allow you to share your questions, insights and views about products and information available on Tor.com and related information.</p>
	<p>
		Please treat the www.Tor.com community with respect. Do not post profane, obscene, inflammatory or spiteful comments, or messages that abuse, denigrate or threaten others. We remind you that if you post your phone number, email address, or other personal contact information, it will become and remain publicly available.</p>
	<p>
		Please keep in mind: A discussion board post is not an effective way to tell us you need help with an order or site feature. If you’d like to tell us about a specific problem, please email us.</p>
	<p>
		<strong><a name="I" title="I"></a>Tell a Friend</strong><br>
		We may offer “Tell a Friend” functionality on this Site to send your friends information from www.Tor.com and its partners.

	<p>
		<a name="K" title="K"></a><strong>Passive Collection of Information </strong><br>
		When you visit our website, your browser automatically sends us certain Internet-related information, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you’re using and your originating domain. We also collect certain information about our website visitors, such as how many users visited our site, the average time spent on the site, the pages viewed, and referring websites. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. While we generally examine such information only in the aggregate, such information could be linked back to individual IP addresses. This site is located in the United States and is operated in accordance with United States Law. In the United States, IP address is not considered personally identifiable information.</p>
	<p>
		This Site’s HTML-formatted web pages may include electronic image requests (called a “single-pixel gif”, “clear-gifs” or “web beacon” request) which are sent to our service providers’ servers. These web beacons are the technique by which our service providers compile anonymous information about your browsing activity on the Site.</p>
	<p>
		We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web site that is saved on your hard disk by your computer’s browser. It holds information a site may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. At www.Tor.com, we use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.</p>
	<p>
		Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you exit your browser, they go away. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit; they do not go away when you exit your browser.</p>
	<p>
		We use cookies to administer certain functions, and to help you navigate the website more efficiently. For example, we use session cookies to maintain information we need to have in order for you to shop at www.Tor.com. Without the session ID cookie, you can’t add merchandise to your bag and carry it to Checkout.</p>
	<p>
		We may also place a cookie on your computer to permit our ad serving companies to identify you as someone who is interested in our site, or services or products, when you visit third-party sites. This enables the ad serving company to deliever our advertising to you on these sites.</p>
	<p>
		You can use our site without accepting cookies. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, if you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all features of this website.</p>
	<p>
		Collection of site usage information on our site is performed on our behalf by a third party service provider. In addition to cookies, the service provider may use web beacons to notify the service provider of web page access by visitors. Our third party service provider may retain such usage information for its own internal purposes.</p>
	<p>
		If your email software is capable of receiving HTML coded emails, when we send you emails our email service provider may collect information via web beacons regarding the delivery of the email, including, whether the email was delivered, whether it was opened, whether it was opened with HTML capable email software, when it was opened, IP address, domain name, browser type or operating system, links you click on and which web pages the you visit. This data may be associated with your email address by our service provider. Additionally, our emails may contain web beacons, which would perform similarly to the web beacons on the Site discussed above.</p>

<p>
	<br>
	<a name="L" title="L"></a><strong><u>How We Use Information We Collect</u></strong><br>
	Personal information collected through or by this Site is used in connection with the purpose for which it was submitted, including: to contact you to answer a question, to send you a newsletter, RSS feed or other information you have requested, for the administration of any contests or sweepstakes, to arrange for any other services you have requested. In addition if you purchase a product on our Site, we will use information to process that purchase and the related information.</p>
<p>
	We may also use the information we collect to enhance your experience while using our Site or viewing our electronic communications, to improve the content of the Site or to improve the quality or variety of the products, services and promotions we offer.</p>
<p>
	We may use the information you provide to us to contact you regarding other promotions, offers, information and items that may interest you. See the discussion of choices if you do not wish to receive such information.</p>
<p>
	<a name="M" title="M"></a><strong><u>How We Share Personal Information </u></strong><br>
	We may share the information you provide with companies that are related to Macmillan through common ownership.</p>
<p>
	In addition, we may share information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so. We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities with selected third parties and may share personal information about our website visitors with them.</p>
<p>
	We also share information provided by our website visitors with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. For example: when you make a purchase, we may share information about you and your transaction with other companies for the purpose of processing your transaction, and we may retain outside companies to manage databases of customer information and to distribute email offerings.<br>
	We also may transfer and disclose personal information in accordance with the terms and conditions of any sweepstakes and contests and any publicity release you may sign in accordance with that sweepstakes or contest. Any information you provide in a user-generated content context may be publicly disclosed and shared accordingly.</p>
<p>
	In addition, we may disclose information about you to others (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent harm or loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud or illegal activity.</p>
<p>
	We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information you have provided through this Site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>
	<a name="N" title="N"></a><strong><u>Links to Other Web sites</u></strong><br>
	We provide links to other Web sites for your convenience and information, including Web sites of other companies related to Macmillan through common ownership. These sites may operate independently from www.Tor.com, and may not be under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit them. We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these Web sites, or the privacy practices of these sites.</p>
<p>
	To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads and provide other services on our Web pages. As a result of your visit to our site, these ad servers and other entities may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and click-stream information. We are not responsible for the data collection practices of any sites linked to www.Tor.com nor does our linking to third party websites or other services constitute sponsorship or endorsement of the content or business practices on these sites. By use of this Site, you agree that use of the hyperlinks to third party sites will be at your own risk.</p>
<p>
	<strong><a name="O" title="O"></a><u>Children’s Privacy </u></strong><br>
	We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. We use technical measures to prevent collection of information from children under 13.<br>
	If our policy concerning collection of information from children under 13 changes, we will revise this portion of the www.Tor.com privacy notice and will comply with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.</p>
<p>
	<a name="P" title="P"></a><strong><u>Security </u></strong><u> </u><br>
	www.Tor.com is committed to protecting the security of information collected on our site. We use technical, physical and administrative methods to safeguard and secure the information we collect on line. When you submit information for a credit card transaction through our purchase pages, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt credit card information during transmission (however, we do not use a secure connection for other types of activities).</p>
<p>
	In connection with your purchases, the Site may request additional Personal Information such as full name, billing and shipping address, email address and telephone number and any such information that is required to fulfill your order. We will only use your credit or debit card number to complete the specific transaction you requested. At www.Tor.com we use a third party service provider to collect your credit card [or debit card] number (and related information). The third party payment service provider will be solely responsible for the collection, use, and storage of your credit card [or debit card] information.</p>
<p>
	Please remember that no data transmission over the Internet, or by other means, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect the information you provide through this website, www.Tor.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Therefore, you understand, acknowledge, and agree that you transmit information over the Internet to this Site at your own risk.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u><a name="Q" title="Q"></a>Your Choices </u></strong><br>
	We give you the option of requesting that we not share personal information about you with third parties that are unrelated by common ownership with Macmillan for marketing use.

That means that you will not receive marketing information from us about books, promotions and services.
