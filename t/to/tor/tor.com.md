# tor.com Privacy Policy

  
If you would like to sign up to receive our free e-newsletter (as well as any free e-books or e-book excerpts we may offer), we will ask you to provide us with your name, e-mail address, zip code and age range. 

  
On occasion, we may offer giveaways or other promotional items. In these instances, we will request your contact information (such as name and mailing address) to fulfill your request, and may request other information that we think is useful or relevant. 

  
We may ask visitors to our website to complete online surveys and opinion polls on a variety of topics, such as their activities, attitudes, and interests, and our products and services. These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors. 

  
From time to time we may run sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, some of which you may enter online. If you choose to participate, we may ask you for your contact information. In some cases, we also may ask you for other information in connection with the promotion. 

  
You may choose to contact us through our website. If you e-mail us comments or questions, we will have your e-mail address, as well as any other information you choose to provide. 

  
We may from time to time offer visitors to our website various other features, and we may ask for certain personal information in connection with these features. 

  
When you visit our website, your browser automatically sends us certain Internet-related information, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you’re using and your originating domain.

We also collect certain information about our website visitors, such as how many users visited our site, the date and time of visit to our site, the time spent on the site, the pages viewed, and referring websites. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. While we generally examine such information only in the aggregate, such information could be linked back to individual IP addresses. We also use cookies on our site to better understand how the site is used, and to administer certain activities. Cookies are small text files that websites often store on the computer hard drives of visitors. A cookie contains a unique code, which is used to recognize your computer. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, if you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all features of this website. 

Collection of site usage information on our site is performed on our behalf by a third party service provider. In addition to cookies, the service provider may use web beacons to notify the service provider of web page access by visitors. Our third party service provider may retain such usage information for its own internal purposes. 

  


Information collected through our website is used in connection with the purpose for which it was submitted (for example, to contact you to answer a question, or to send you a newsletter, information or a product you’ve requested).

We may also use the information we collect to send you information or products we think may be of interest to you, to customize our contacts with you and to do other internal analyses, such as market research, that will allow us to better meet the needs of our customers. 

  


We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information about our website visitors, except as described here. We may share the information you provide with companies that are related to Macmillan through common ownership. We also share information provided by our website visitors with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. In addition, we may share information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so. We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities with selected third parties and may share personal information about our website visitors with them. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information you have provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice. 

  


We may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information, including websites of other companies related to Macmillan through common ownership. We may also provide widgets hosted by other websites for your convenience. You may choose to sign up with these other websites to use these widgets. These sites may operate independently from [www.tor.com](http://www.tor.com/), and may not be under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked website. We may not be responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or the privacy practices of these sites. 

  


This website is not intended for children. We use technical measures aimed at preventing collection of information from children under 13\. 

  


We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect information in our possession and control against foreseeable hazards. Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet. 

  


We give you the option of requesting that we not share personal information about you with third parties that are unrelated by common ownership with Macmillan for marketing use. [Click here](mailto:optout@tor.com?subject=Third%20Party%20Opt%20Out) to send us an e-mail with your name and e-mail address(es) if you DO NOT want us to share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing use. 

We also give you the option of requesting that we not share your information with companies related to Macmillan by common ownership for marketing use. However, PLEASE NOTE that, because of the integrated nature of Macmillan and some of these companies, if you opt out of sharing with them, you will also automatically be opted out of marketing use by Macmillan. That means that you will not receive our e-newsletter or any free e-books we may offer, or other promotions and services. [Click here](mailto:optout@tor.com?subject=Macmillan%20Opt%20Out) to send us an e-mail with your name and e-mail address(es), if you do not want us to share your information with related companies for marketing use (or use the information for marketing purposes ourselves). (Keep in mind, however, that some of our related companies may have independently obtained your information, in which case you may continue to receive communications from those companies, unless you opt out directly with them.)

Please be aware that we are able to effectuate an opt-out only for a specific e-mail address. So, if you have more than one e-mail address or if you have changed your email address, your opt out request may not be effectuated properly. If you believe you have opted out, but continue to receive e-mails from us, please contact us by one of the means listed under “How to Contact Us”, below, and we will endeavor to resolve the issue. 

  


We may change or update portions of this Privacy Notice at any time and without prior notice to you. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the Notice. We will indicate above the effective date of the Notice.
