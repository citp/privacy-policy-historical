### Toro’s Commitment to Your Privacy

The Toro Company respects your privacy.

### The Personal Information Toro Collects

There are a few places where Toro gives you an opportunity to provide Toro your personal information. This refers to information that lets Toro know the specifics of who you are, and may include, without limitation, your first and last name; mailing address, email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, credit card number, and other personal identifying information. When you engage in certain activities on the Site, such as ordering a product or service; filling out a form to request a demo, entering a contest or sweepstakes; participating in social media activities involving things such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Foursquare, whether at this Site or the social media web sites; filling out a survey; sending feedback or product reviews; requesting owners and parts manuals; or registering your product online; Toro may ask you to provide personal information. If you choose to share any personal information with Toro, you will see that the amount and type of personal information Toro requests depends on how you use the Site.

While you can generally browse this Site without telling Toro who you are or revealing personal information about yourself, Toro is, however, able to determine your IP address, which will reveal your location to Toro. Toro may use your IP address, together with other personal information that you may provide to us, such as your email address, to communicate with you directly about products and services that Toro believes may be of interest based on your activity on the Site.
