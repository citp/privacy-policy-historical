### 2\. The Personal Data We Collect

There are a few places where Toro gives you an opportunity to voluntarily provide us with information that directly or indirectly identifies you (your “Personal Data”). When you engage in certain activities, such as ordering a product or service; filling out a form to request a demo or enter a contest or sweepstakes; participating in third-party social network service activities whether through the Services or third-party social network services; filling out a survey; applying for a job; sending feedback or product reviews; requesting owners and parts manuals; visiting our facilities or registering your product online, Toro may ask you to provide Personal Data such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, credit card number, and other information. You choose whether to engage in these activities. Depending upon the activity, some of the information Toro asks you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

In addition to the information you choose to provide, Toro may automatically collect other information about you through the Sites.

We may combine any of the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Notice. For example, Toro may use your IP address, together with other Personal Data that you may provide, such as your email address, to communicate with you directly about products and services that Toro believes may be of interest based on your activity on the Sites.

Toro also may collect information about you from publicly available sources, or from third parties such as our channel partners or credit reference agencies in connection with your purchases. Toro may receive information about your interaction with us and use of our Services through a third-party social networking service.

  * **Targeting Cookies** or advertising cookies are used to collect information about your browsing habits in order to enable Toro and its affiliates to provide you with information about products and services that may be of specific interest to you. 



Web Beacons are small strings of code (e.g., 1 x 1 pixel) that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. You can disable the ability of Web beacons to capture information by blocking cookies.

Persistent Device Identifiers are unique strings that are associated with the mobile device that you use to connect to an App. Persistent device identifiers may be modified or disabled by sophisticated users.

We use service providers to help us analyse patterns of user behaviour on our Sites. These providers will collect your IP address and other information by automated means in order to report on your user activity. They may retain and use anonymised, aggregated data collected from users of our Sites in connection with their own businesses, including in order to improve their products and services. Authentication and tracking logs are used to compile user statistics.

We use advertising brokers to advertise online. Toro and third party vendors such as Google use cookies to serve our ads to you on sites across the Internet based on your past visits to the Sites.

Third parties may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different Internet services when you visit our Sites.

Where our Sites interact with social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, these platforms may deploy persistent cookies which will be kept on your device until their expiration or earlier manual deletion. If you use these functionalities, the plug-in and its content are loaded directly from the social media provider’s servers and included in the website by your browser. We cannot influence which Personal Data the social media provider will collect about you. For more information, please see the privacy notices of [ Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php), [ Twitter](https://twitter.com/en/privacy), [ YouTube](https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en-GB/policies/privacy/) and others.

### 4\. European Residents: Right to Opt-out

To comply with legislation in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the UK, Toro asks for your consent to set the cookies described above. When you arrive on the Site, a banner informing you of the types of cookies we use will appear. By clicking 'continue' you expressly consent to the use of such cookies. Once your consent has been provided, this message will not appear again when you revisit. If you do not click “continue,” your continued use of the Site will indicate your implied consent. The banner will remain, and we will set only the cookies for which implied consent is sufficient. If you, or another user of your computer, wish to withdraw your consent at any time, you can do so by altering your browser settings or by selecting the opt-out options above. In some instances, when you opt-out, a new cookie (Opt-Out-Cookie) is placed in your web browser. This tells the third party provider to cease data collection from your browser and prevents advertisements from being delivered to you.

If you would like us to stop sending you marketing emails, we encourage you to use the opt-out link at the bottom of any marketing email we send. You may also contact us at [legal@toro.com](mailto:legal@toro.com).
