**IP Addresses**

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a set of numbers assigned to you by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) during the time that you are online. Every website you visit has access to this information, due to the way the Internet works.

We (Torrent AVI) only record IP addresses for the usage of statistics and when users enter comments on the website.

**Email Addresses**

We require proper and correct email addresses for an leaving a user comment due to security reasons, and once provided, it is kept on file to link your email address to your account name.
