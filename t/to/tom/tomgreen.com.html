<p>Thank you for visiting TomGreen.com. Your privacy is important to us. To
better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online
information practices and the choices you can make about the way your
information is collected and used.</p>

<p>The Information We Collect</p>

<p>At TomGreen.com, you can create your own artist site, enter contests, vote
in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services
such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums
or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be
collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone
number, fax number, and information about your interests in and use of
various products, programs, and services. You may also be asked to submit a
person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card or
e-mail reminder. The types of personally identifiable information that may
be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name,
address, e-mail address, and telephone number. When you visit many of our
Web pages, we also may collect certain non-personally identifiable
information such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape,
Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g.,
Windows 95 or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider
(e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</p>

<p>How We Use the Information</p>

<p>IP Address:</p>

<p>We use your IP address to gather broad demographic information, such as
country of origin.</p>

<p>Cookies:</p>

<p>Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your
preferences when you surf the Web. Cookies, by themselves, do not give your
e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you
choose to provide this information by, for example, registering to the site.
Once you register, you don't have to reenter your information each time you
enter our site.</p>

<p>Cookies may also be used by our ad servers for the purpose of: calculating
the number of unique users (a key advertising metric), performing frequency
caps (preventing a user from seeing the same ad more than a specified number
of times), and for the geographic targeting of ads. The cookies that come
from these ad servers do not track any identifying personal information.
When a user scrolls over an ad on TomGreen.com, the name of the ad server
appears in the "mouse-over." This does not necessarily indicate that such
company is collecting data on the user, merely that the company's computers
served the ad.</p>

<p>Personal Information:</p>

<p>Through surveys and newsletter registration, our site may request users to
give us contact, demographic, and/or financial information (such as name,
locale, gender, age, income level and e-mail address). We may use the
information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our
products, programs and services, to respond to your inquiries about our
offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services we believe
may be of interest to you. We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable
information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site
and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use
this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer
you products, programs, or services. This demographic information is also
used for advertising and marketing purposes. We use the information gathered
during newsletter registration to notify users of updates made to the
content of their choosing.</p>

<p>We hold contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact
information (such as their name and e-mail address) and demographic
information (such as their ZIP code and age). The user's contact information
is sometimes used to contact the user when necessary, such as to notify them
if they win a contest or to notify users of upcoming contests. There are
three primary types of contests: (1) We host solely and all information that
is collected stays in-house. (2) We may share address information with third
party for shipping purposes. (3) In some rare instances, a third party may
host the contest and all information is then shared. By virtue of their
sponsorship, this third party may obtain personally identifiable information
that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes,
or promotion. TomGreen.com has no control over the third-party sponsors' use
of this information. TomGreen.com will notify you at the time of requesting
personally identifiable information if third-party sponsors will obtain such
information.</p>

<p>The information we collect in connection with our online forums and
communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this
information to facilitate participation in these online forums and
communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or
services.</p>

<p>We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for
example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose
such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.</p>

<p>Agents and contractors of TomGreen.com who have access to personally
identifiable information are required to protect this information in a
manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not
using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services
they are performing for TomGreen.com.</p>

<p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized
disclosure of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable
information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is
inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result,
for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the
site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for
purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.</p>

<p>If TomGreen.com discloses personally identifiable information to companies
not owned by TomGreen.com who want to market products or services to you, we
will provide you with an opportunity to opt out or block such uses.</p>

<p>TomGreen.com may on occasion combine information we receive online with
outside records to enhance our ability to market to you those products or
services that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>Finally, TomGreen.com sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable
information provided to us in ways unrelated to those described above
without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated
uses.</p>

<p>Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</p>

<p>The Service may contain links, through advertising or otherwise, to other
Web sites ("Linked Sites"). The Linked Sites are not under the control of
TomGreen.com and TomGreen.com is not responsible or liable for the
communications or materials of any Linked Sites. TomGreen.com is providing
these links to you as a convenience and to advertisers to promote their own
sites or products, and the inclusion of any link does not imply
TomGreen.com's endorsement of the site or any association with its
operators. You are responsible for adhering to the applicable Terms of Use
for any other Web site. You are strongly encouraged to evaluate any third
party sites, as you are solely responsible and liable for any interactions
you may have with such sites, their sponsors and other third-parties. We
also take no responsibility for how a third-party sponsor utilizes the user
information it collects.</p>

<p>Bulletin Boards and/or User Reviews</p>

<p>This site contains message boards and/or user-posted reviews available to
its users. We request users to give us contact information, such as name,
e-mail, address, occupation, and interest to become a registered user. This
information may be used by the administrator to send the user e-mail
notices. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these
areas becomes public information, and users should exercise caution when
deciding to disclose personal information.</p>

<p>Our Commitment to Security</p>

<p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
security, and correctly use the information we collect online.</p>

<p>How You can Access or Correct Information</p>

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help
verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. To change
information that you post in our Community area, you can access an edit
screen from the main page of Community. Click here to edit your existing
page. If you have further questions regarding your Community page, please
read our Artist Site Terms of Use.</p>

<p>This site gives users the following options for removing their information
from our database, to not receive future communications, or to no longer
receive our service:</p>

<p>1. Users can send e-mail to unsubscribe@mediatrip.com
2. Users can send mail to the postal address displayed below.</p>

<p>Special Note for Parents</p>

<p>The site you are visiting is not necessarily appropriate for children.
Parental discretion is advised. Much of our content is geared toward persons
18 years of age or older.</p>
