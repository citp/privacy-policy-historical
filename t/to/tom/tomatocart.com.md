# Privacy Policy - Privacy Policy - TomatoCart

At TomatoCart we recognize the importance of your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is processed.

This Policy may be modified by us at any time when needed without notice to you. And we expect most changes will be minor. Please review it each time you visit TomatoCart or use any of our tools or services.

#### Information we collect and how we use it

We collect the following types of information:

  *  **Information you provide**

When you would like to post in our forum, we require you to register first. We ask you for personal information such as your name, username and email address. These collected registration information is available to TomatoCart forum members, the staff and volunteers.

When you purchase a product or service from us, we also request billing and shipping addresses, phone number, credit card number or other payment information. (Receipt information includes the name, address and phone number of the recipient, either yourself or someone else.) If a credit card number is collected it’s never stored on our servers. Such information is strictly confidential and only shared with shipping and payment processors, and/or selected partners as needed. This information is only used to complete the order.

We may update these data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges. All information of this nature is maintained by us in a secure database and transmitted across the Internet from you to us, using secured transmission encryption.

We will collect or use the information for those purposes only with your consent.
