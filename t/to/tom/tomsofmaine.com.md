# Privacy Policy | Tom's of Maine

## Privacy Policy

## What information does tomsofmaine.com collect?

While maintaining our commitment to your privacy, we do collect personally and non-personally identifiable information about you.

## Personally indentifiable information

Personally identifiable information is any information about you that identifies you, such as your name, contact information, or likeness. For example, it includes your name and email address that you provide to us during email newsletter registration or video discussion participation so that we can properly fulfill your requests. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, if you decide to complete a user registration form or online survey, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, email address, mailing address and telephone number), age group, gender and product concerns and the brands and products you use.

If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information.

When you submit your personally identifiable information on the Site, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## Non-personally identifiable information

Non-personally identifiable information includes your browser type, domain name, IP address and how you clicked through the Site. We collect this information so that we can identify general navigation patterns and better understand how to improve your experience with us. As you navigate through this Site, such anonymous information may be passively collected using various technologies, such as cookies or Internet tags. Your Internet browser automatically transmits to this Site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. This Site may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies (a bit of information that a website sends to your Web browser to help the Site remember information about you and your preferences) and Internet tags.

We use such passively collected anonymous information to provide better service to Site visitors, compile and analyze statistics and trends and otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use. Such information is not combined with personally identifiable information collected elsewhere on the Site unless you have consented.

If you do not wish to allow cookies or want to change your cookie preferences, you can make changes in your Internet browser if your browser permits, but some parts of our Site may not work as efficiently if you do.

## How we use information

In addition, we may make full use of all information acquired through this Site that is not in personally identifiable form.

## Sharing information with third parties

We do not sell, trade, or rent your email or contact information with outside third parties.

We are careful to limit the sharing of any information we may collect on the Site. We may disclose information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, or with the rights or property of other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires the disclosure.

We may also share information that we collect on this site with companies that perform various services for us. We may, for example, share information with market analysts, advertisers, business partners, sponsors, our affiliates and other third parties. We generally limit the information we share with these companies to that which is required to perform their services. We also share information collected on this site to (i) comply with applicable law, (ii) respond to any legal process served on us, or (iii) protect our rights or our property.
