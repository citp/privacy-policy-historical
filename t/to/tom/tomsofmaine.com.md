# Privacy Policy

At Tom's of Maine, we respect your privacy. Your personal information is never shared with other companies [or used in ways that violate your trust]. 

## What information does tomsofmaine.com collect?

While maintaining our commitment to your privacy, we do collect personally and non-personally identifiable information about you. Personally identifiable information includes your name and email address during email newsletter registration or video discussion participation so that we can properly fulfill your requests. Non-personally identifiable information includes your browser type, domain name, IP address and how you clicked through the Site. We collect this information so that we can identify general navigation patterns and better understand how to improve your experience with us. 

## Personally identifiable information

We do not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you provide it to us. For example, if you decide to complete a user registration form or online survey, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, email address, mailing address and telephone number), age group, gender and product concerns and the brands and products you use. 

If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. 

When you submit your personally identifiable information on the Site, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

## Non-personally identifiable information

As you navigate through this Site, certain anonymous information may be passively collected using various technologies, such as cookies or Internet tags. Your Internet browser automatically transmits to this Site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. This Site may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies (a bit of information that a website sends to your Web browser to help the Site remember information about you and your preferences) and Internet tags. 

We use such passively collected anonymous information to provide better service to Site visitors, compile and analyze statistics and trends and otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use. Such information is not combined with personally identifiable information collected elsewhere on the Site unless you have consented. 

If you do not wish to allow cookies or want to change your cookie preferences, you can make changes in your Internet browser if your browser permits, but some parts of our Site may not work as efficiently if you do. 

## How we use information

We only ask for personally identifiable information that is necessary to process your request, such as allowing you to participate in video discussions or sign up for a newsletter. Except as otherwise stated, we may use information collected via this Site to improve the content of our Site, to customize the Site to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it) for our marketing and research purposes and for any other purpose specified. In addition, we may make full use of all information acquired through this Site that is not in personally identifiable form. 

We do not sell, trade, or rent your email or contact information with outside third parties.
