We do not share, sell, lease or rent information about our customers to unaffiliated third parties, except in the following circumstances:

  1. We may share aggregate, anonymous or summary information regarding our customers and their behaviors with partners, advertisers or other third parties. This data is not personal information and so will not identify you personally.
  2. We may share information with companies that provide support services to us, such as a printer, mailing house, fulfillment company, credit card processor, email service provider or web host, amongst others. These parties may need personal information about you in order to perform their functions. However, these parties may not use any personal information we share with them about you for any other purpose other than in connection with performing supporting functions for us.
  3. We may publicly disclose the name, city, and state of the winner of any online sweepstakes and contests.
  4. We may be required to disclose such information in order to comply with legal requests and processes, enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use), otherwise protect or assert the rights, property, interests or personal safety of TOMS® (including its employees, directors, suppliers, distributors, service providers, users of the Website or others), or if we are otherwise required to disclose such information by law.

## PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION

Shopping on the Website is easy and we strive to ensure that your order and credit card information are safe and secure. As a result, TOMS® has implemented certain physical, administrative, and technical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information you provide.

As with any transmission over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved in sending personal information and no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. In order to try to minimize this risk, we encrypt your personal information, including your name, credit card number and address, using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol so that it cannot be read as it is transmitted over the Internet.

SSL is considered the industry standard and is among the leading software available to encrypt online transactions. Our servers' use of SSL works with the main browser applications available on the market. This means that you may not be able to use the SSL if you have an older version of an Internet browser that does not support secure transactions, or if your computer is located on a local area network (LAN) that uses a firewall that prohibits secure transactions.

You should ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your account information by limiting access to your computer (or other device) and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

## YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

If you are a California resident, you may request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please write to us at the address below.

## CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are under the age of thirteen (13) you should not register or provide information on our Website or to TOMS®. If you have knowledge that a child under the age of thirteen (13) has submitted Personal Information to us, please email us at [legal@toms.com](mailto:legal@toms.com), and we will remove that child's personal information from our files.

## CORRECTION TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION OR DISABLING YOUR ACCOUNT

You can (a) access, correct, or update your Personal Information, and/or (b) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. You can make these requests by emailing your request to TOMS® Customer Service department at [customerservice@toms.com](mailto:customerservice@toms.com).
