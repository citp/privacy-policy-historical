We will provide you with directions in all emails and newsletters on how to be taken off our newsletter list.<br>
											<br>
											<br>
											<font class="header">DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</font><br>
										
									As a general practice, tommy.com does not sell or release any information gathered on the Site to any third parties for such third parties' independent use. So, for e ample, we do not sell your email addresses to spammers or sell your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers. Tommy.com may share personally identifiable information with our affiliates, service providers, or other third parties for tommy.com internal business purposes. In addition, from time to time we may offer you the opportunity to receive offers, news and/or updates from third parties, and if you request to receive such information we will provide your information to the indicated third party. Tommy.com also may disclose personally identifiable information as required by law or valid legal process, such as in response to a subpoena, a search warrant, court order, or in response to a valid administrative agency or law enforcement agency, or if we or our service providers believe that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prosecute, or prevent any unlawful or fraudulent acts or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another user or the general public.<br><br>
									Certain demographic information collected from visitors to the Site may be used by tommy.com and/or by companies working with us, such as advertising and marketing consultants for internal marketing analysis and to improve our products, services and the Site. This information is collected and shared with such designated third parties in an aggregated, non-personally identifiable basis.

										<br>
										<font class="header">COOKIES</font><br>
										A "cookie" is a small line of te t that is stored within your browser when you visit a cookie-enabled website. As you browse the Web, cookie-enabled sites will send cookies to your browser, along with pages. Your browser probably has options that will let you control whether the browser accepts cookies, rejects cookies, or notifies you each time a cookie is sent to you.<br>
										<br>
										We use cookies on the Site for a number of reasons. First, cookies can help  us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Second, cookies  allow us to better understand how users use the Site, which in turn helps us  focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users. <br>
										<br>
										If your browser is set to reject cookies, cookie-enabled websites will not  recognize you when you return. This provides you with anonymity, but it also  makes it very difficult to offer you customized services. It is also less  secure than using cookies, because all of your specific data must be sent to  the website each time you view a page. Accepting cookies means your private  data can stay at the Web server, and the only information transmitted over  the Internet is your ID cookie.<br>
										<br>
										If your browser is set to accept cookies, any cookies that are sent to your browser are stored in your computer for a period of time. There are a few different types of cookies. A "session" cookie is stored only in your computer's working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all of your browser's windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever. A "permanent" cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, ne t week, or 10 years from now. Permanent cookies stay on your computer until either<br>
										<br>
										a) they e pire,<br>
										b) they are overwritten with newer cookies,<br>
										c) you manually remove them.<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<font class="header">INFORMATION FOR PARENTS</font><br>
										 We make every effort to adhere to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), including its guidelines on Internet advertising. All tommy.com marketing efforts, including the Site, are closely scrutinized to conform to these guidelines. We encourage parents to supervise and join their children in e ploring cyberspace and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them not to provide personal information over the Internet without parental permission. Parents should additionally be aware of a growing variety of software capable of filtering online information to reflect their own choices and guidelines. This Site is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a user is under the age of 13 and has provided personally identifiable information without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove such personally identifiable information from our records.<br>
										<br>
										 For additional information about COPPA please refer to <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/biz.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/biz.htm</a><br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<font class="header">CONTROLLING OR CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION OR OPTING OUT</font><br>
										 You can access and update your contact information and preferences by going directly to<a href="http://www.tommy.com/club/edit-profile.jsp"> edit your profile</a> and following the  on-screen instructions. If you have any questions or if you would like to  unsubscribe from receiving any marketing materials, newsletters, or other  communications from tommy.com please email us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@tommy.com">customerservice@tommy.com</a>.   In addition, each marketing email that is sent by tommy.com will have an  unsubscribe link that you can click on to unsubscribe.  If you prefer, you  can also unsubscribe by sending a request to tommyhelp@tommy.com.  Please be advised that it may take ten (10) days for unsubscribe requests to be effective. <br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<font class="header">LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</font><br>
										 The Site may contain links and references to other websites and organizations. Please note that different rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third party service providers or vendors or any other sites you encounter on the Internet (even if these sites are branded with our branding or framed by the Site). We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party sites, investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to any such third parties.<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<font class="header">SECURITY</font><br>
										We maintain reasonable and appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information in our possession. Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the e isting legal and technical environment, we cannot fully ensure that your personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For e ample, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries.
