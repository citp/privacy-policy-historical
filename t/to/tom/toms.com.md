**PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION**

Shopping on the Site is easy, secure and worry-free. We have taken several measures to guarantee that your order and your credit card information are safe and secure. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology that works with Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and above), Netscape Navigator (versions 2.0 and above), and AOL (AOL 3.0 and above), and the Site’s security has been tested & verified by McAfee Secure Sign.

SSL is considered the industry standard and is among the leading software available to encrypt online transactions. Your personal information including your name, credit card number and address is encrypted so that it cannot be read as it is transmitted over the Internet. Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, any information you transmit to us is sent at your own risk.

**SAFE SHOPPING GUARANTEE**

The Fair Credit Billing Act states that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any amount up to the full $50.00, TOMS Shoes will cover the entire liability, up to the full $50.00.

If you suspect unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card according to its reporting rules and procedures.

Please note that TOMS Shoes will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at TOMS Shoes online shopping while using our secure server.

**CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have collected personally identifiable information from a user of the Site who is under the age of thirteen, we will remove that child’s personal information from our files.

**OPT OUT / CORRECTIONS**

Upon your request, we will (a) correct or update your personal information; (b) stop sending emails to your email address; and/or (c) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. You can make these requests by emailing your request to TOMS.com's Customer Support department at info@TOMSshoes.com. Please clearly label the subject line "Opt Out / Corrections," and do not email your credit-card number or other sensitive information.

**OFFLINE COLLECTION, USE & DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION**

The majority of information that we collect is obtained through our Site, and this Privacy Policy applies only to that online collection of personal information. We also collect information offline, where we also try to protect the privacy of your personal information. One example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions. When someone calls, we will ask only for the personal information we need in order to place the order or to answer the question. When we need to store information (such as order information), we will enter it into our database through SSL encryption. (See the Protecting Your Information section above for more information).

**POLICY CHANGES**

We may change our Privacy Policy from time-to-time. We encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current Privacy Policy.

**QUESTIONS AND FEEDBACK**

We welcome your questions, comments and concerns about privacy. Please send us any and all feedback pertaining to privacy, or any other issue at [info@TOMSshoes.com](mailto:info@tomsshoes.com).
