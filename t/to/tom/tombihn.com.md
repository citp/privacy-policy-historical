  All visitors to our website are anonymous. We do not collect personal information, except when you place an order. Our server does log your IP address to give us an idea of where folks are coming from. But we do not link your IP address to any personally identifiable information.   
  We don't give any information to anybody about our customers. We're not going to send you any unsolicited emails. In fact, you can pretty much count on being forgotten around here as soon as we fill your order (just kidding).   
  We will archive your order (sans credit card info), so if you need to know what you ordered last year, we **might** be able to look it up.   
  Otherwise, we'll mind our business (packs & bags) and let you mind yours.
