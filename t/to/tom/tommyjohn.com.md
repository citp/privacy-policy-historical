# Privacy Policy | TOMMY JOHN

This policy covers how Tommy John treats personal information that we collect and receive, including information related to your past use of our products. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Tommy John does not own or control, or to people that Tommy John does not employ or manage. 

Tommy John supports and adheres to the guidelines and practices adopted by the Direct Marketing Association's "Privacy Promise to American Consumers." By honoring the DMA's "Privacy Promise to American Consumers," we recognize that the consumer marketing information we maintain must be used responsibly, in beneficial ways and with respect to individual choice. We have agreed to (1) provide customers with notice of their ability to opt out of information rental, sale or exchange with other marketers, (2) honor customers' requests not to share their information with other marketers, and (3) honor customers' requests not to receive mail, telephone or other solicitations from Tommy John. 

We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please click here. 

Tommy John does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Tommy John under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Tommy John communicate with you about offers from Tommy John and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Tommy John' terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We transfer information about you if Tommy John is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Tommy John will notify you before information about you are transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 



Tommy John may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Tommy John account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
