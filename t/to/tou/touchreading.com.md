# Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

The Community Portal is managed and owned by Touch Local Ltd ("Touch").

In providing the Community Portal Touch collects information about you. In doing so, we take your privacy and our obligations under the data protection legislation very seriously. You have a right to expect a website to disclose its privacy policies - how your personal information is collected, used and shared. You also have a responsibility to choose which sites you feel comfortable disclosing such information to.

In order to comply with our obligations, Touch must obtain your consent to the use of your personal information. Please ensure therefore that you read the following statement carefully. Registration will be taken as consent to certain uses of your information.

#### Item A: Access to Registration Information

Touch will under no circumstances give access to your registration information to any third party for any purpose, either commercial or otherwise. Consistent with our obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998, your information is maintained on a secure webserver in what we believe to be a well protected environment. Neither Touch nor any other website operator can, however, guarantee that your information will remain secure from unauthorised access. 

#### Item B: Cookies

In order to become a registered member of the Community Portal, you must have 'Cookies' enabled on your machine. Our website relies on this technology to allow you to re-access your registered user profile and personalised page during a web session. In this way, once you initially log in during a web session, you will not be asked for your log-in ID and password again unless you log out. This mechanism is employed solely for your convenience and for no other purpose.

#### Item C: Public vs Confidential Information

You acknowledge that all of your submissions and postings to the public portion of the website are public and not private information. Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your household. Touch specifically disclaims any liability with regard to any actions resulting from your submissions and postings to the public portion of the website. Generally, any communication which you post to the website is considered to be non-confidential. If a particular webpage or form permits the submission of information that will be treated by Touch as confidential, that fact will be stated on those pages.

#### Item D: Use of Public Information

By posting communications on or through the website, you automatically grant Touch a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform and display the information alone or as part of other works in any form, media or technology whether now known or hereafter developed. The foregoing grants shall include the right to exploit any proprietary rights in such communication, including but not limited to rights under copyright, trademark, service mark or patent laws under any relevant jurisdiction. You agree to waive any moral rights which you may have in such material. Touch reserves the right to refuse to post and/or remove any material sent or posted by you.

#### Your consent

By registering with us you consent to the collection and use of your information by Touch in the ways outlined above. If, having given your consent to the use of your data, you subsequently change your mind you can stop all, or particular uses of your data by sending us an e-mail.
