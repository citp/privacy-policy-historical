# Privacy Policy - TouchNote

Our privacy policy is a way for us to explain how we’re looking after you and your details. Please don’t be put off by how formal it sounds (we did it for the lawyers).

If you’ve got questions about anything we’ve written here, please get in touch at [help@touchnote.com](mailto:help@touchnote.com) so we can shed some light on it.

### **INTRODUCTION**

At Touchnote, we believe that as our valued customer you have a fundamental right to privacy and to control your personal information. We are grateful that you have chosen to be our customer and we take the responsibility of not only printing and posting your cards, but also of being guardians of the personal information that you give us, extremely seriously.

This privacy policy together with our terms of use ([https://www.touchnote.com/terms/](https://www.touchnote.com/terms/)) sets out how Touchnote Limited, (“we”, “our”) will use any personal data we collect from you, or you provide to us, during your use of our products and services (whether existing now or in the future) (the “Services”) at [www.touchnote.com](https://www.touchnote.com/) or through our Touchnote mobile app (together our “Platform”). Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By visiting the Platform you accept and consent to the practices described in this policy.

For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulations (the “Regulations”), the data controller is Touchnote Limited of Ground & Basement Floors, 17-18 Clere Street, Old Street, London EC2A 4LJ. We may from time to time use data processors, who are not employees, agents or otherwise connected with us, with whom we have an agreement to process your data.

### **INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU**

We will collect and process the following data about you:

Information you give us. This is information about you that you give us by filling in forms on our Platform or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise.

The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, financial and credit card information. In order to take advantage of some of our Services, you may need to supply us with the personal details of a third party (for example, their name and address if you wish to send them some of our products). We will not use this information for anything other than providing the Service for which the information was supplied.

Information we collect about you. With regard to each of your visits to our Platform we will automatically collect the following information:

This can be stored in both video and word form and may allow us to access session videos designed to better illustrate how users interact with the platform. 

We are not aware of the identity of the User from which we have collected Non- Personal Information. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which is available to us while Users are using the Service. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information and behavioral information and which may include, the User’s Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your uniform resource locators (URL), operating system, type of browser, browser plug-in types and versions, screen resolution, Flash version, time zone setting, the User’s ‘click-stream’ on the website, the period of time the User visited the website, methods used to browse away from a page, and any phone number used to call our customer service number.

Information we receive from other sources. We work with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers) and may receive some information that is not personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else. For example, we may collect anonymous aggregated information about how users use our services.

We do not knowingly solicit or collect any information about users who may be under the age of 16, and will delete any information provided by such individuals as soon as possible. Please do not provide us with any personal information if you are under the age of 16.  While we do allow users under the age of 16 to use the Platform, any users under the age of 18 should discuss the use of the Platform with their parents before they submit or upload any content to the Platform.
