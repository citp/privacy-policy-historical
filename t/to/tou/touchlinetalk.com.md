**Cookies** **  
** A cookie is a small, unique text file that is saved on your hard disk by a website. The cookie is used by the web site to identify your computer whenever you visit that website. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies can only be read by a web server from the same domain (e.g. **Digital Score Ltd** ) that saved the cookie on your computer. **Digital Score Ltd** and/or our third party advertisers may use cookies and Web beacons (also known as ‘pixel tags’) to help you save time, track your usage patterns and provide you with a more personalised service on our web site. The main purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific Web page. For example, if you personalise Web pages, or register for products or services, a cookie helps our Web page server to recall your specific information. When you next visit the **Digital Score Ltd** web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. Even if you use more than one computer on a regular basis, we can link cookies together so you will still receive a personalised online experience. **Digital Score Ltd** can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. So, instead of one site for all **Digital Score Ltd** customers, each **Digital Score Ltd** user can have a site which is unique to them. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  **Digital Score Ltd** uses cookies provided by third-party technology such as DoubleClick to collect data about the websites that you visit.  We will use the data that we collect through our use of these cookies to ensure that you see relevant and useful adverts when you visit our websites.  Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you want to disable cookies, find out which browser you are using and follow the instructions below. Unfortunately, if you choose to decline cookies, some of the interactive features of the **Digital Score Ltd** websites may not be available to you. We advise regular users of **Digital Score Ltd** websites to accept cookies from **Digital Score Ltd**. **Digital Score Ltd** is committed to protecting your privacy and only uses cookies to improve our service to you, for example, by offering tailored information based on your interests.
