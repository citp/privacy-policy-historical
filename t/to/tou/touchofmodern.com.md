**What does this privacy policy cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers TouchOfModern’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that TouchOfModern gathers when you access the Website and when you use TouchOfModern’s services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that TouchOfModern does not own or control (including any third-party products or services used for logging into the Website or that are integrated with the Website), or to individuals that TouchOfModern does not employ or manage.

**INFORMATION COLLECTED OR RECEIVED FROM YOU**

**What personal information does TouchOfModern collect?**

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to personalize their experience on the Website. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

**Personal Information You Provide to Us:**

We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected in this fashion may include your name, email address, gender, date of birth, IP address, location, browser information, username, password, and any other information necessary for us to provide our services. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about TouchOfModern’s products and services, including specials and new features.

**Personal Information Collected Automatically:**

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use our services. TouchOfModern automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, browser information, operating system, timestamps, the pages you request, and the actions and path you take on the Website.
  * Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and how they use its various components. TouchOfModern only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use the Website or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, TouchOfModern never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
