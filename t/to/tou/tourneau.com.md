Our Commitment to Your Privacy  
Your privacy is important to us. Tourneau has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to protecting your privacy and to disclose our information collection and use practices.

The Information We Collect  
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Tourneau web site. We use your IP (Internet protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our web site, to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

As many sites do, we use cookies (a small file kept on your computer) to keep track of certain ordering and request information so you don’t have to re-enter it and to deliver content relevant to your interest. You can disable the cookies by using your browser settings, but your use of our web site may become cumbersome. You can order products or catalogs and request preliminary appraisals on some pages. The types of personal information collected at these pages include contact information (e.g., name, address, email address and phone number), financial information (credit/debit card information), information about a timepiece to be appraised (e.g., brand, condition, where and when purchased), and optional demographic, family and personal data such as birth dates, spouse’s name, interest in buying a new watch and current watch brand.

How We Use Information  
We use information you provide about yourself when placing an order or requesting a preliminary appraisal only to complete that order or appraisal. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or appraisal and as required by law. On some of our pages, you can submit information about other people. Tourneau will not disclose any information you provide about someone else.

You can use our web site to order our catalogs as well as request updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our web site will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the request form. We use contact and optional demographics, family and personal data to provide you with information about our products and services, and may also use it, or allow others to use it, to provide promotional material about quality products or services of other companies. You may opt-out of receiving Tourneau and third party promotions (please see "How To Contact Us"), below.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site and may share it with advertisers and manufacturers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our web site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our catalog request form, but we would not disclose to these advertisers or manufacturers your personally identifiable information.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

From time to time, we make our mailing list available to carefully screened companies whose products might be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these mailings, please send an e-mail to customerservice@tourneau.com.  Please type "Opt Out Request" in the subject line of your e-mail.  Your opt out request will be processed within 30 days of the date it was received. Once you have opted out, you do not need to do so again. We also want to make sure our mailings are correct. If you are receiving duplicate catalogs or we are using an incorrect address, or you no longer wish to receive our catalogs, send an e-mail to customerservice@tourneau.com.

Our Commitment to Data Security  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. When you order products or services from us, we will use reputable companies to verify and validate the credit card and other information you provide before we will fill your order. Please note that for your protection, your order may be delayed as a result of this verification process. We also use reputable order fulfillment companies to process and deliver your order. We have agreements with all of these companies to ensure that your personal information is kept private. However, please note that your transaction may be canceled if we reasonably determine that the order information you have provided to us is incorrect or fraudulent. 

Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.

How You Can Access or Correct Your Information  
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us (see below). We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows errors. To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor.
