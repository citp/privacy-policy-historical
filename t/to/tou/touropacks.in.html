Please read the following statement to learn  about our information gathering and dissemination practices. Note: Our privacy  policy is subject to change at any time without notice. To make sure you are  aware of any changes, please review this policy periodically.&nbsp; ok </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><strong>Collection       of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
    We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name,phone       number, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with Touropacks.in.       While you can browse some sections of our site without being a registered       member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do require       registration. We do use your contact information to send you offers based       on your previous orders and your interests.</li>
  <li><strong>Use       of Demographic and Profile Data</strong><br>
    We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the       extent we use your personal information to market to you, we will provide       you the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal information       to resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote a safe service;       collect fees owed; measure consumer interest in our products and services,       inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and       updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error,       fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our terms and conditions; and as       otherwise described to you at the time of collection. In our efforts to       continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and       analyze demographic and profile data about our users' activity on our       website. We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems       with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is also       used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. We       will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These       surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information       (like zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to tailor your       experience at our site, providing you with content that we think you might       be interested in--and to display content according to your preferences.&nbsp;<br>
    Cook: A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a Web       server on a Web browser so it can be later read back from that browser.       Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information       specific to a given user. Touropacks.in places both permanent and       temporary cookies in your computer's hard drive.

Those entities and affiliates may not market to you as a result of such sharing  unless you explicitly opt-in. We may disclose personal information if required  to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably  necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. We may  disclose personal information to law enforcement offices, third party rights  owners, or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably  necessary to: enforce our Terms or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an  advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party;  or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general  public. Touropacks.in and its affiliates will share some or all of your  personal information with another business entity should we (or our assets) plan to merge  with, or be acquired by that business entity.
