###### 4\. Information We May Collect

Except as disclosed below, we do not sell, barter, give away, or rent your Personal Information (defined in Section 4(a) below).

(a) Personal Information. Use of certain features of the Website, for example signing up to receive our newsletter, or responding to our survey(s) may require that you provide to us certain personally identifiable information, in other words, information that identifies or describes you, such as your name, email address, telephone numbers, address, zip code, age, and gender (collectively, the “Personal Information”). We also may collect and store Personal Information about you that we receive from other sources, e.g. information you email to us; information we collect through surveys such as the Media Profile Survey or the Tough Mudder Universe Survey; or the information we receive from Eventbrite.com when you register for a Tough Mudder event as a participant or spectator. Eventbrite.com has its own privacy policy and you should refer to it for any questions you may have about the information Eventbrite, Inc. collects about you when you register for a Tough Mudder event using Eventbrite.com.

(b) Aggregated Information. Even if you do not request a newsletter or fill-out a survey, when you interact with our Website, we may collect certain non-personal information. For example, our servers keep an activity log that tracks all visitors to the Website. The information in the activity log does not identify you individually, but may include (among other data): your IP address, your registered domain or home server, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, number of clicks, software crash reports, type of browser used, session identification number, search terms, search results, access times and referring website’s address(es).

(c) Cookies and Spyware. We do not install spyware on your computer, nor do we use spyware to retrieve information from your computer.

Like many other websites, we may use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or internet enabled equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences. We may use cookies to track your use of our Website and its features. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Website and make it easier and/or more relevant for your use. 

You may occasionally get cookies from companies with links on our Website. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Privacy Policy.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. By not accepting cookies you may not be able to access certain information and certain features on the site may not function as intended.

(d) No Information Collected From Children. Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13 years of age nor do we knowingly correspond in any manner with children under 13. If you are under 13 years of age you should not use this Website, and under no circumstance should you send information about yourself to us. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will immediately delete that child’s information from the Website and cease any further communication.

###### 5\. How We May Use Your Information

  * If you fill out a survey expressing interest in volunteering for and/or hosting a Tough Mudder event or if you request to receive posters or our newsletter, we may use your Personal Information to contact you and may share your Personal Information with third parties for purposes of fulfilling your request.

  


(c) Use of Anonymous Information. We may use anonymous information to help us determine how you use parts of the Website and how we can improve our Website.
