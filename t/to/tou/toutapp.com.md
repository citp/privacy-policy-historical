**How Do We Secure the Personal Data We Collect?**

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration or destruction of the personal information you provide to us on the website. However, no security system can be completely secure.  Accordingly, while we use commercially reasonable, industry-standard means to secure your information, we cannot guarantee that your personal information will not be improperly accessed, disclosed or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information during transmission using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software.

**What About Third Party Websites?**

This website may contain links to external websites operated by third parties and our products may be integrated with third party products. Please be aware that these third-party websites and products are governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of such websites and products.  An example of an integrated use is accessing our product through Gmail.  Those customers will be subject to our privacy policy, as well as Gmail√ïs privacy policy.  We encourage you to read the policies of such third parties. 

**How Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?**

When you interact with our website, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We may use or engage others to use cookies and clear gifs to track user activity and collect website information. In addition, we may combine the website information we collect with the other data we collect. 

**_Cookies_** : When you come to our website, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. In addition, we may permit certain third parties to place cookies through our website. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website, other than by linking persistent cookies to our current customers as defined below.

●      _Session Cookies_. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to our website. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests, and to verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our website.

●      _Persistent cookies_. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies that only we, or our service providers, can read and use, to identify the fact that you are our customer or prior visitor to our website. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.

●      _Third Party Cookies_. We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable website information. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of our website, and to analyze website usage. We do not share this data with other third parties, except as described above in the section √íHow Do We Use Information We Collect.√ì You should note, however, that we do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this privacy policy cover such third parties' use of data.

**_Disabling Cookies_** : Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Website visitors who disable their web browser√ïs ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our website; however, you must enable cookies in order to use our services.

**_Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)_** : We or the third parties we engage to track and analyze Website Information may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on our website. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users of the web. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We [do not][ ** _confirm_** ] tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails. They let us know which emails have been opened by recipients, allowing us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt out of emails from Tout, please notify us at privacy@toutapp.com

**Do We Collect Information From Children?**

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. When users registering for our products or at our website identify themselves in the registration process as below the age of 13, we will block such users from providing any personal information. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13 we will delete the information as soon as possible. 

**Do We Collect Information from International Visitors?**

For users outside the United States, please note that any data or personally identifiable information you submit through our website or products will be transferred out of your country and into the United States. You consent to such transfer through your use of our products and website. You also warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United States.

**How Are Changes Made To This Privacy Policy?**

We reserve the right to change this statement from time to time.

**How Can Personal Information Be Accessed and Updated?**

Whenever you use our products, we aim to provide with access to your personal information.  If that information is wrong, you may update it or delete it through the service or by contacting us at privacy@toutapp.com, unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal reasons.  When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
