**1) Personal Data**

**What is personal data?** Personal data, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.  We collect this data from you when you fill out a form or enter information on our site, which may include, but is not limited to the following: names and contact information (i.e. emails and telephone numbers); credit history and other transaction history.

**2) What and how do we collect information about you?**

We collect information about you when you fill in any of the forms on our website (i.e. sending an inquiry, filling in a survey, giving feedback, etc.). Website usage information is collected using cookies. You agree that we are entitled to obtain, use and process the information you provide to us to enable us to provide our services and for other related purposes including, but not limited to the following: updating and enhancing client records; analysis for management purposes; carrying out credit checks in relation to you; legal and regulatory compliance; and crime prevention. When submitting forms on our website we use a third-party software provider for automated data collection and processing purposes, the provider will not use your data for any purposes and will only hold the data in accordance with our policy on data retention. **Analytics** We use analytics to store information about how visitors use our website so that we may make improvements and give visitors a better user experience. Usage data, such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, length of visit, page views and website navigation paths, as well as information about the timing, frequency and pattern of your service use may all be considered as part of TouchUpDirect, LLC’s analytics. **Cookies** Cookies are files containing an identifier that is sent by a web server to a browser and stored by the browser.  These files collect standard internet log and visitor behavior information, which is then used to track visitor use of the website and to create statistical reports on its activity.  You can set your browser not to accept cookies and the above websites tell you how to remove cookies from your browser.  Please note in a few cases some of our website features may not function properly.  These cookies do not store any personal information about you, such as your name and address. **IP addresses** An IP Address is a unique numerical address assigned to a computer as it logs on to the internet. Your IP address is logged when visiting our site, but our analytic software only uses this information to track how many visitors we have from particular regions. **Internet Based Advertising** We use various advertising services, and as such there are tracking codes installed on our website so that we can manage the effectiveness of these campaigns.  We do not store any personal data within this type of tracking.

**3) How will we use the information about you and why?**

At TouchUpDirect, LLC, we take your privacy seriously and will only use your personal information to provide the services you have requested from us.  We will only use this information subject to your instructions and applicable data protection laws.  All personal data we receive from you will only be processed for the purposes of preventing crime or as otherwise permitted by law or with your consent. We collect information on our website to process your inquiries and improve our services, and will also use this information to share updates with you about our services which we believe may be of interest to you.  However, we will notshare your information for marketing purposes with companies so that they may offer you their products and services. **Third-party disclosure** Our work for you may require us to pass your information to our third-party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other associated organizations for the purposes of completing tasks and providing the services or products to you on our behalf.  However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the personal information that is necessary to deliver our services and not for these providers to use your information for its own direct marketing.  Non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for advertising or other uses. We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your information unless we provide users with advance written notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, safety, enforce our site policies, or protect certain rights.

**4) Transferring your information outside of Europe**

As part of our website’s services, the information which you give to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Union (“EU”). For example, some of our third-party providers may be located outside of the EU.  Where this is the case we will take steps to make sure the right security measures are taken so that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy.  By submitting your personal data, you’re agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing.  Where our third-party supplies are in the United States, we have ensured that their services fall under the “[Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome)” whereby participating companies are deemed to have adequate protection and therefore facilitate the transfer of information from the EU to the United States. If you use our services while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU to give you those services.
