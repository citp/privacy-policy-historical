Visual Reality offers (software) products and related services for organising sports competitions and tournaments, and for providing clear insight in competition- and tournament details and statistics.

In order to provide and execute our services, we may collect and process the personal data of business contact persons of customers (in particular sports federations and sports associations). In this respect, we will process data such as name, gender, title/function (within the organisation), (business) email address and (business) telephone number.

If you register via the online account for participation in a tournament, we also require your banking details for processing payment of the registration fee.

In addition, if you participate or have participated in competitions and/or tournaments, your name and membership number will be displayed in results (for example, ‘ _head to head_ ’) and rankings.

#### Protection of personal data

We have taken adequate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data in the best possible way against loss, unauthorised access, disclosure, change and misuse.

#### Personal data we share with third parties

Visual Reality only shares your personal data with third parties as far as necessary to provide our services or to comply with statutory obligations.

For example, if you have registered to participate in a tournament, we will share your personal data with the organising sports association. In this respect, any results of the tournament may subsequently be shared (by the organising sports association) with the relevant sports federation for publication in rankings. Our software products make this exchange of data technically possible, however, the (ultimate) responsibility in relation to the processing of the personal data in this regard rests with the sports federation or sports association (as the case may be).

Visual Reality has concluded data processing agreements with all sports federations, sports associations and other third parties ((sub-)processors) for the processing and sharing personal data in respect of its software and services.

Any personal data that are processed under the responsibility of Visual Reality as ‘controller’ will only be transferred to countries or third parties (such as an international sports federation) outside the European Economic Area (EEA), as far as necessary and in accordance with the statutory requirements in relation thereto.

#### Retention term

We retain your personal data no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which we have collected the personal data, or in correspondence with an applicable statutory retention term. You may at all times request the removal of your personal data. If the request for removal is permitted, your personal data will be removed without delay.

You also have the right to request for inspection, correction, completion or transfer of your personal data. Additionally, you may request us to limit certain processing, or to object to the processing of your personal data. Any such requests may be directed to us in writing or through email via the contact details below. After receipt, we will assess your request and respond thereto within the applicable statutory term of four weeks.

Where technically possible we will follow up on requests for correction or removal of personal details without delay. In cases where Visual Reality does not qualify as the ‘controller’, but as the ‘processor’ – of a specific sports federation or sports association – any requests for exercising certain rights (such as inspection, correction or removal) will need to be directed to the applicable sports federation or sports association. We will inform you when such situation occurs.

#### Contact – questions or complaints

Any questions, inquiries or complaints regarding the processing or protection of your personal data can be directed to us via email ([helpdesk@tournamentsoftware.com](mailto:helpdesk@tournamentsoftware.com)).
