**YOUR CALIFORNA PRIVACY RIGHTS (CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ONLY)**

California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of Personal Information to third parties (i.e., our affiliates) for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  Such requests must be submitted to us by email at [info@togethernetworks.com](mailto:info@togethernetworks.com). We will provide a list of the categories of Personal Information disclosed to third parties (i.e., our affiliates) for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties.  This request may be made no more than once per calendar year.  In your request, please specify that you want a “Your California Privacy Rights Notice.” Please allow 30 days for a response. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the email specified in this section.

**OUR RIGHTS TO AMEND THIS POLICY**

We keep our privacy policy under regular review and will post any changes to it on this page.

**LINKS TO OTHER THIRD PARTY WEBSITES**

Our websites, applications, and promotional materials, may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our third party networks, advertisers and affiliates.

**ADDITIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN USING THE INTERNET**

We do not solicit or target persons younger than the legal age for collection of information online. By submitting information to us you represent that you are over the age of 18. We encourage minors to seek the consent of their parents before providing any information about themselves or their households to anyone on the Internet. We encourage parents to take an active role to protect the privacy and security of their children and to prevent the inappropriate use of information about their children. We support the development of technologies that help parents to control the collection and use of personal information from children who use online services in their households. In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, any information we may receive from users we believe to be under the age of 13 will be purged from our database.
