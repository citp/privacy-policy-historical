											<a name="1"></a><b>Our Commitment To Privacy</b>
											<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. At all times, Total Gym Fitness, LLC reserves the right to disclose information where required by law or to comply with valid legal process (such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order), to protect the company’s rights or property (including without limitation, in the event of a transfer of control of Total Gym Fitness, LLC or substantially all of its assets), or during emergencies when safety is at risk.  Also, this policy only applies to the collection of information at www.totalgymdirect.com. Different policies may apply to other websites or information that we get offline.  We may revise this policy from time to time and will post a notice to our homepage when we make such revisions. </p>
											<p><a name="2"></a><b>The Information We Collect:</b></p>
											<p>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the totalgymdirect.com website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:</p>
											<ul>
												Name<br>
												Address<br>
												Email address<br>
												Phone number<br>
												Credit/Debit Card Information<br>
												<p></p>
											</ul>
											<p><a name="3"></a><b>The Way We Use Information:</b></p>
											<p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order or request only to complete that order or request. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
											<p>If you submit a request for information on our products, we may use the information you provide to relay the appropriate information to you. This includes your mailing address, your email address and/or your telephone number. This information is used only by ourselves and/or our agents for the purpose of fulfilling your request.</p>
											<p>We use your email addresses to answer the email we receive and to notify you of the progress of your order. We also use the information you provide to help improve our website and our services, to customize your experience at our website, or to send updates or notices about our company and the products we offer that we think may be of interest to you.</p>
											<p>We contract with 3rd party agent companies in the processing and shipping of orders and to service customers.  We do not permit these companies to retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.<br>
											  <br>From time to time, we may share your name, email address, and contact information with select companies, vendors, and business associates whose products and services may be of interest to you.  As a result, these companies may provide you with valuable information about their products and services as well as special opportunities that are available to you.  Although we only provide your information to reputable companies, they may have different privacy policies and practices than those of Total Gym Fitness, LLC.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any third-party company or organization.											</p>
											<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website,  but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
											<p>Like most standard Web site servers we use log files.&nbsp; This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp; This information is not linked to personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
											<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
											<p><a name="4"></a><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b></p>
											<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Please see our <a href="goto.php?secure=goto.php&amp;page=security.php">Security Notice</a> for more details.</p>
											<p><a name="5"></a><b>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</b></p>
											<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. However, if the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with personally identifiable information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us at privacy@totalgymdirect.com if they want this information deleted from our files.  If Total Gym Fitness, LLC otherwise obtains knowledge that it has personally identifiable information about a child under 13 in its files, we will delete that information from our existing files so that it is not in retrievable form.</p>
											<p><a name="6"></a><b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information</b></p>
											<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.</p>
											<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
											<p><a name="7"></a><b>How To Contact Us</b></p>
											<p>Should you have any questions or concerns about these privacy policies,  if you would like to update your personal information, or if you would like to remove your name, telephone number, and postal and email addresses from the lists we use to send notices or updates,  please call us at 1-800-501-4621, send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@totalgymdirect.com">privacy@totalgymdirect.com</a> or contact our corporate office at:<br>
