Security Officers posted at the entrance of the Casino may use identification verifiers to scan any ID including if they believe it may have been tampered with or altered. 
  2. Casinos are also required, under provincial and federal laws, to verify government-issued photo ID and to record certain information, including name, date of birth, address, type of ID, place of issuance of ID, and ID reference number, before conducting certain types of transactions. These transactions include but are not limited to foreign exchange transactions of Cdn.$3,000 or more, cash transactions of Cdn.$10,000 or more (see Large Cash Transaction Records), casino disbursement transactions of Cdn.$10,000 or more, credit extensions of any amount, and opening a front money account in any amount.

  3. **Photography**. To protect your privacy, photography is prohibited on the gaming floor. The only exceptions to this prohibition are photographs of jackpot and tournament winners, who consent in writing to their picture being taken. Except for your spouse or significant other, no other customers will be included in the photographs. Caesars Windsor may also take photographs inside the casino for publicity purposes and advertising campaigns. In these cases, only actors are used in the photographs, and signage is posted to advise customers of the photography shoot. In some cases, entertainers will have their performances in the Entertainment Centre videotaped and photographed. When this is happening, we will notify you through signage and/or an announcement at the beginning of the performance.

  5. **Manual and Electronic Forms**. During your visit to Caesars Windsor, you may be asked to provide information for various forms, requiring different types of Personal Information. The forms you may be asked to complete fall in the following categories: 


  1. __Customer Tracking and Reward Programs.__ From time to time Caesars Windsor has established and may in future establish various player tracking and reward programs. For example, you may choose to become a member of our Loyalty Program so that you can redeem your slot points for cash back, reward credits for cash, or qualify for complimentaries, and many other promotional offers, and receive invitations to parties and events.

To determine your eligibility for credit, we may disclose your Personal Information to credit reporting agencies, financial institutions and other casinos. The information on our credit applications is required under the Regulations made pursuant to the Gaming Control Act, and is similar to the type of information a bank would require before extending a consumer loan. This information may be shared with other casinos including those taking part in the Loyalty Program. Such casinos may be located outside of Canada.

Certain Personal Information about the person conducting the transaction is required on these reports. Federal law prohibits us from disclosing that a Suspicious Transaction Report has been completed or reported, or the content of such a report.

**XII.   PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE ALCOHOL AND GAMING COMMISSION OF ONTARIO AND THE ONTARIO PROVINCIAL POLICE (OPP)**

The AGCO is an agency of the Government of Ontario.  The AGCO is responsible for ensuring that gaming in this province is conducted with honesty and integrity.  This involves overseeing the operation of Ontario’s gaming facilities.  Officers of the OPP are seconded to the AGCO to carry out law enforcement activities within gaming facilities.

Regulations made pursuant to the _Gaming Control Act_ require that gaming facility operators install video surveillance in certain parts of the facilities.  OPP officers monitor the video surveillance in order to identify any illegal activity.  In cases where illegal activity is suspected, OPP officers carry out an investigation.  Some investigations may involve use of facial recognition information comparing a facial scan to a database of known or suspected criminals.

Patrons of gaming facilities do not automatically have their facial recognition information gathered by the OPP when they enter a gaming facility.  Facial recognition information is gathered and used strictly in the course of police investigations.  Access to information gathered by OPP officers is restricted to the officers who are assigned to work in the gaming facility.  All information gathered is protected by sophisticated systems.  Once an investigation is completed, the relevant face recognition information is removed from the OPP database.

The AGCO gathers Personal Information in accordance with the _Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act_ for the purpose of law enforcement.  Anyone seeking access to the information must meet the requirements set out in the _Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act_.  If you have any questions or would like more information about the role of the AGCO or its use of face recognition, please contact:
