Total France is very concerned about privacy issues. Please read the following: 

**Cookies** We do not use cookies to obtain or transmit personal information about you. Our cookies simply record data such as your language preference, your login status, and other site-specific information to enhance your experience of using Total France. This cookie information is stored on **your** computer, not on ours. Cookies do not gather personal information. See more [cookie information here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120320072300id_/http%3A//www.totalfrance.com/france/help.php?pick=cookies). 

**IP address** We collect, keep, and publish your IP address on your posted adverts. We do this to help protect all users from fraudulent postings and spam. 

**Personal Details** Any personal details you submit, either when registering or when placing an ad, will not be disclosed by us to third party mailing lists or sellers. Total France has a rigid anti-spam policy, principally because we are sick of receiving so much of it ourselves. This means we will not tolerate a user attempting to spam other users, nor will we be spamming you. If you receive spam from any other user please notify us immediately. 

**Email addresses** Your email address will not be sold or given to any third parties at any time other than in the event that the company is sold to another company and the new owner is provided with the email addresses necessary for the running of the business as a part of the acquisition of the assets of the business. Your email address will be used by us to communicate administrative messages to you such as advertisement responses, your user details, advertisement expiry notices, surveys, notices regarding the Forum etc. From time to time we may also send you newsletters and other email information which we think will be of interest either from TotalFrance, from Horizon New Media Ltd or any of its subsidiaries. You are entitled to request removal of your details from newsletter mailings at any time 

**Private Messages** As part of our Forum we provide a Private Message service. We treat your private messages as strictly private and confidential and will never show the contents to a third party without your express permission, unless specifically required by law. Private messages are stored in a secure database which is only accessible by the senior technical permanent staff of Horizon New Media Ltd or its contractors, following senior management authorisation. Although in practice we rarely need to access the private message database we reserve the right to retrieve and view private message information in the event of a serious breach of our terms and conditions which may have legal or serious commercial implications e.g. libel, damage to reputation, spam attacks, abuse of members or threats of violence to individuals. We also reserve the right to access and pass on private message information if requested to do so by the legal authorities. We regret that, due to the time and cost involved, we are not able to offer a retrieval service for private messages sent or received by members which you may have deleted, other than in the circumstances described above. You should make copies of your incoming or outgoing messages if you think you will need to refer to the contents at a later date. 

**Login Details** We will never disclose your Login information. We will never email you to ask for your Login information. If you ever receive such an email it could be a malicious hoax; please report it to us. Our system is set up to email your login information to you automatically if you have forgotten it (just click on the 

_Lost Password_ link). 

**Other sites** Certain ads and forum postings may contain links to other websites ... our Links page certainly will. Total France cannot be held responsible either for the content or for the privacy practices of any other web sites.
