Commercial Posting**

The purpose of Peru Expat and Travel is to be a topical social network. That means the free and open exchange of information, opinions, recommendations, experiences, etc related to the topic of the site. This of course, also includes commercial postings, ie: posting information and links to your products and services.

However, we are in the processing of limiting the commercial posting to those who also participate socially in an active manner. Some sections require you to "earn points" before you can use them. In other cases postings and/or links will be deleted if we feel their are unsuitable, ie: one posts with a link to your website. For our directory submissions, we require you to complete an interview before we'll review your submission. In cases of abuse, ie: repeating commercial postings without any social participation or off-topic commercials posts, your account and access to our network of sites may be disabled.

The cornerstone of our new policy on social participation is for you to build a "expert page" (see Main Menu / Experts) where you can make a comprehensive and interesting page for your business, services, website, etc. You don't need a website to participate, and if you have one you are welcome (and encouraged) to link to it. It is recommended you create an "expert page" as the starting point for your participation.

All of your social interaction will be automatically linked to your "expert page", leaving you to simply participate socially and build interest in your abilities, skills, interests, experiences and develop friendships that will lead you to be the other members think of when they need your product or service.

Additionally, anyone who engages in commercial posting, through our experts page or otherwise, may be emailed with directly relevant emails. ie: if the moderator deletes a commercial post, if a directory submission is approved, etc. Additionally, any commercial posting, not made within the "experts page", ie: a forum post, profile, etc it may be turn into an expert page by the moderator and you will be notified by email and encouraged to edit your page.

Please do not enter URLs, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc for the titles of your posts, profile name, etc.
