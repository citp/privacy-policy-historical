**3\. How We Share or Disclose Your Information**

We may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our Site or while using our services under the following circumstances. 

     **Personal information**

We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you the opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared (see below “Controlling Your Personal Information”). 

We may share your personal information in connection with sharing, selling or licensing your product reviews to third parties. Your first name and last initial, profile photo, and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be transferred to such third parties and displayed on their web sites in connection with such third parties' publication of your reviews. 

We may share your information with our beauty brand partners (“Brand Partners”) in the course of your purchase of their Vouchers to help them process your redemption of their Vouchers. Any such redemption subjects the information provided to the participating Brand Partner to its privacy policy, and NOT this Privacy Policy. This may result in certain of our Brand Partners marketing to you directly. We do not have any responsibility for the actions of our Brand Partners nor do we have any liability to you for their actions.

Total Beauty may share your information with third party businesses for their online marketing purposes; but we do not disclose your personal information to any such third parties that may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so.

We may provide our postal mailing list (consisting of names and postal mailing addresses, but not email addresses) to trusted third party businesses whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. To identify products that we believe may be of interest to you, we may aggregate information you have given us (demographic information, for example) and information that we have collected (such as past purchase history) available from our records and other sources. 

We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include supporting our Site functionality, supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Site, and filling orders and customer support.

We may disclose your personal information to strategic partners with which we undertake traffic linking arrangements or co-branded promotions. We may disclose your personal information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. 

We may disclose your personal information when we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Site's terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.

We may disclose your information to subsidiaries and affiliates of Total Beauty.

We may disclose your personal information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. The personal information which you provide to us is an asset of Total Beauty and may be included in the assets transferred in the event of a substantial corporate transaction. 

There are a number of places on our Site where you may click on a hyperlink to access other web sites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy.

Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.

These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States.

For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Site and the most popular areas and features of our Site. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop content and new services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. 

We hire vendors, including Google, to undertake our remarketing program, which allows us to communicate with people who have previously visited key pages on the Total Beauty Site. These third party vendors, may show Total Beauty ads on sites on the internet and use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to the Total Beauty Site.

     **Other**

From time to time, we may use your information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post the policy changes to our Site to notify you of these changes and we will use for these new purposes only data collected from the time of the policy change forward.

You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future.

You may however continue to receive email invitations from your friends and additional Total Beauty communications while Total Beauty processes your opt-out request.

**7\. How we protect your personal information**

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For instance, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. The Site encrypts your credit card number and other personal information using secure socket layer (SSL) technology to provide for the secure transmission of the information from your PC to our servers. In addition, we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information. However, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
