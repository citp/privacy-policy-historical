From time to time, we collect information about you from third parties, such as updated contact information, and search term and search result information from your web searches.

### How do you use my personal information?

All of the information we obtain about you is stored securely on our website, and we use it only to evaluate your situation and provide legal services to you, to allow unaffiliated sponsoring lawyers or law firms to evaluate your case and provide legal services to you, and to provide ongoing communications to you in furtherance of these legal services. We do not sell or share your personal information with anyone other than our own internal personnel and the unaffiliated sponsoring lawyers and law firms, and certain authorized third parties (such as expert witnesses) who may be retained to assist in your bankruptcy case. As part of this process, those third parties agree to keep your information confidential and agree not to share it with any third party without your express permission. 

We only disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions, or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws, valid legal process, a court order, a current judicial proceeding, or to protect our rights or property. 

We disclose personally identifiable individual information and the other information you provide us to unaffiliated sponsoring lawyers or law firms in order for them to contact you and to determine whether to handle your case.

However, we work hard to protect your information at all times, and we protect you information in several ways. We store your information on a secure server that only TotalBankruptcy.com and its authorized personnel can access through a password.
