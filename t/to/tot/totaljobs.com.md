At totaljobs we make every effort to comply with our obligations under the 1998 Data Protection Act. Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your CV and other information you may give us while using the site.

Contact and other details you supply as part of the registration process are stored by us and used to provide you with the information you have requested.

| Profile and CV information |   
  | 

When you complete a profile, including your CV, with totaljobs, it can be made available to be viewed and downloaded, by way of an online search over the Internet, by our customers. These may be direct recruiters, employment consultants or other organisations, who pay us for such access. You can choose to make your profile and CV unavailable. 

**IMPORTANT:** Your current employer may be either a customer of totaljobs or a client of one of our customers. Totaljobs cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality. As part of the registration process totaljobs offers you the option of remaining anonymous. 

Some of our customers may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area. 

When you create your profile, and store your CV on 'my totaljobs', we store the information for you but it is protected by your password and may only be accessed by you. It does not form part of our totaljobs CV database and cannot be searched or accessed by totaljobs customers. You can delete it at any time. Your CV can only be viewed by a totaljobs customer if you have consented to this within the profile section. 

We rely on you to ensure that your CV and contact details are kept up to date. You should update your CV at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed. Once your profile and CV are on our database we will contact you every six months using your most recent contact details to ask whether you want it to remain there. If we do not hear from you, your profile and CV will be removed from our database.

These customers may be direct recruiters, employment consultants or other organisations, who pay us for such access.
