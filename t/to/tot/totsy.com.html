<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
(valid as of September 1, 2009)
<p>The privacy of our Members 
is important to us.  Please read our Privacy Policy below so you 
understand how we collect information about our Members, what type of 
information we collect about our Members, why we collect such information, 
how we protect personal information about our Members and in which limited 
circumstances TOTSY may have to share such information with other parties. <br>
</p>
<p><b>1. TOTSY's 
Privacy Policy.</b></p>
<p>The information we collect 
through our Site helps us provide you with information specific to your 
needs and interests. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") 
covers TOTSY's website (the "Site"). Please read below to review 
our Privacy Policy and the types of information we gather through our 
Site.  In this Privacy Policy, "we", "us", "our" and 
other similar references mean TOTSY and "you" and "your" and 
other similar references mean a specific user of the Site.  By 
visiting the Site, you accept the practices described in this Privacy 
Policy. <br></p>
<p><b>2. How 
TOTSY Gather and Use Information About 
Its Members?</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Cookies</b>. Cookies 
are pieces of data assigned by a web server that uniquely identify the 
browser on your PC. Websites typically use temporary cookies called 
"session" cookies to ensure that you are recognized when you move 
from page to page within one site and that any information you have 
entered is remembered. For example, if an e-commerce site did not use 
session cookies then items placed in a shopping basket would disappear 
by the time you reach the checkout. Websites also use cookies called 
"persistent" cookies to enable a website to remember you on subsequent 
visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of services or functions 
offered. TOTSY attempts to install both persistent and session cookies 
when a user arrives at our Site. Cookies enable our systems to gather 
information about your navigational patterns through the site. Viewers 
have the option to accept or disable cookies at any time through their 
browsers. For more information about how to delete cookies from your 
web browser, you will usually find responses in the "help" menu 
of your web browser.  Please note that if you block or refuse to accept 
cookies, or delete cookies between visits to the site, you may not be 
able to access or use certain features or functions of our Site. </p>
<p><b>(ii) Server Statistics</b>. 
We collect general statistics to track user trends on our Site. These 
statistics include hits to our server, the types of browsers used to 
access our Site, page views, and navigational patterns. The information 
that is collected in this manner does NOT provide us with any personally 
identifiable information about our users. It helps us track "where" 
our users are coming from. This allows us to pinpoint high traffic areas 
and determine the most effective ways to communicate with our users. 
As part of that ongoing analysis, TOTSY also uses devices called "web 
beacons" to help us identify when emails sent to you have been received 
and read. In order to prevent the introduction of viruses and hackers 
into the TOTSY site we may collect information, such as IP addresses, 
into a log file to be used to identify potential hackers of the TOTSY 
site.</p>
<p><b>(iii) Personal Information 
You Provide To Us</b>. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal 
Information" is any information that identifies you, would enable 
someone to contact you, or that describes your relationship with TOTSY. 
We collect and store Personal Information when you register to use our 
Site, ask a question, complete a form, conduct a transaction, or send 
us an email. While you are not required to submit any information to 
our Site, if you do not provide the requested information, you may not 
be able to access or use some of the features and functions of our Site 
and we may not be able to provide you with certain services. TOTSY uses 
your Personal Information to complete transactions, respond to your 
requests, deliver the products and services you request, and notify 
you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest 
you. <br></p>
<p><b>3. What Security Procedures 
Does TOTSY Use To Protect Personal Information of Its Members?</b></p>
<p>The privacy of our members 
is important to us.  We use physical, electronic, and administrative 
safeguards to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, maintaining 
data accuracy, and correctly using your Personal Information.  Except 
as specified in this Privacy Policy, we use commercially reasonable 
efforts to limit access to your Personal Information to the employees, 
agents, and officers of TOTSY who need the information for the performance 
of their jobs.  <br></p>
<p><b>4. Will 
TOTSY Disclose The Information It Collects To Outside Parties?</b></p>
<p>TOTSY warrants that its employees, 
agents, officer and directors, consultants or subcontractors are obligated 
to and will hold any Personal Information in strict confidence and to 
take all reasonable measures to ensure that confidentiality is respected.  
TOTSY may share information with carefully selected vendors and business 
partners with whom we work. This includes companies that offer affinity, 
frequent-user, and reward programs; and, companies that perform marketing 
services and other business operations for us (including providing goods 
and services to our users, as necessary to complete transactions you 
request).  All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated 
to keep all information confidential and to use the Member information 
only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and us.  
We may provide aggregate statistics about our Members, sales, traffic 
patterns and related site information to reputable third party vendors, 
but these statistics do not include Personal Information. We may disclose 
Personal Information we collect from you if required by law, or in the 
good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or 
comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect 
and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of other 
users of our Site; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal 
safety of users of our Site or the public. <br></p>
<p><b>5. External Links. 
About Other Entities Which May Have 
Links on Their Sites to Our Site.</b></p>
<p>We are not responsible for 
how non affiliated companies or organizations collect, use, disclose, 
or secure the information that you provide to them. If you choose to 
access a third party website linked to our Site, you do so at your own 
risk and subject to any terms of service or privacy policy (if any) 
associated with such third party websites. <br></p>
<p><b>6. Collection Of Information 
From Children.</b></p>
<p>TOTSY does not direct any of 
our content specifically to children.  Users of our Site are required 
to be at least 18 years old, and any user under 18 is not an authorized 
user.  If we learn that a user is under thirteen (13) years of age, 
we will promptly delete any Personal Information we have collected about 
that user. <br></p>
<p><b>7. Consent To Processing 
In The United States.</b></p>
<p>By providing any Personal Information 
to TOTSY, all users, including, without limitation, users in Canada 
and the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously 
consent to this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of such Personal 
Information across international borders in accordance with TOTSY's 
standard operations, including the collection, storage, and processing 
of such information in the United States of America, and waive any rights 
that they may have under their local laws which would conflict with 
TOTSY's Privacy Policy. <br></p>
<p><b>8. Your California Privacy 
Rights.</b></p>
<p>As provided by California Civil 
Code Section 1798.83, a California resident who has provided Personal 
Information to a business with whom he/she has established a business 
relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California 
Member") is entitled to request information about whether the business 
has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third 
parties' direct marketing purposes.  In general, if the business has 
made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a request 
by a California Member, the business is required to provide a list of 
all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the 
preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal 
Information that were disclosed. </p>
<p>However, under the law, a business 
is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business 
adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy 
of not disclosing Member's Personal Information to third parties for 
their direct marketing purposes unless the Member first affirmatively 
agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses 
this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying 
the California Member of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal 
Information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. </p>
<p>As stated in this Privacy Policy, 
we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing 
purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure -- typically 
by opting in to receive information from a third party that is participating 
in some activity describes on our site. If you do ask us to share your 
information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only 
share information in connection with that specific activity, as we do 
not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To 
prevent disclosure of your Personal Information for use in direct marketing 
by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide Personal 
Information on our site. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive 
future communications from a third party, your information will be subject 
to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do 
not want that third party to use your information, you will need to 
contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third 
parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy 
of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity 
will handle your information. </p>
<p>California Member may request 
further information about our compliance with this law by contacting 
us on our website under the CONTACT US menu. Please note that we are 
only required to respond to one request per Member each year, and we 
are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through 
our Site. <br></p>
<p><b>9. Modification And Notification 
Of Changes.</b></p>
<p>TOTSY may at its sole discretion 
edit this Privacy Policy.  Notice of all changes to the Privacy Policy 
will be provided as specified in Section 12 (Modification and Notification 
of Changes) of our <a href="/terms.html">Terms 
of Service</a>].  <br></p>
<p><b>10. In Summary.</b></p>
<p>TOTSY is committed to protecting 
your privacy. The information collected from our Site helps us better 
understand our market and consumer interests. This allows us to serve 
our Members and business associates with the level of satisfaction they 
deserve.</p>
