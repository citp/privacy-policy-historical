We also automatically collect your Internet  Protocol (IP) address (which allows us to understand how you use our site and  to enable us to make changes to our site in order to improve your user  experience); information regarding your computer and your connection to our  site (such as your browser type, operating system, and platform); and your user  history to, through, and away from our site (such as session information, page  loading times, page errors and broken links, the length of your visits to  specific pages within our site, and other information related to your  experience on our site). </li>
			  <li><b>Information  We Obtain From Third Parties:</b> From  time to time we collect information about you from third parties, such as  updated contact information, and search term and search result information from  your Web searches.</li>
		   </ol>
			<h3>How Do  We Use Information We Collect Through This Website?</h3>

			<h3>Who Will We Share Your Information With?</h3>
			<p>Except as set forth below, we will not  share your personal information with any outside parties without your  permission.

			<ol>
			  <li><b>Participating  Lawyers and Law Firms:</b> To provide the service offered through this  Website, we will forward your information to the lawyer or law firm identified  when you complete our form and request a consultation in order for them to contact  you, to evaluate your needs, and to determine whether to represent you.
