# PRIVACY POLICY : Modnique

**PRIVACY POLICY**

Modnique, Inc. and ("Modnique," "we," "our," "us") knows that our customers and other visitors to our site may be concerned about how their personal information is used and shared.  First and foremost we want to assure everyone that we take privacy concerns seriously.  As such, we welcome and encourage you to read the following in order to fully understand our Privacy Policy.  

By visiting and using the Modnique.com website and the features, services, content or mobile applications offered therein (collectively, the "Website"), you acknowledge that you understand and accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

**What information does this Privacy Policy cover?**

This Privacy Policy covers Modnique's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Modnique gathers when you are accessing Modnique's Website and when you use Modnique’s services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, or to individuals that Modnique does not employ or manage.  Also, we do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.

**What Personal Information does Modnique collect?**

The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and make purchases via the Website. We collect the following types of information from our customers.

**Personal information you give us:**

We may receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, gender, zip code, country, IP address, browser information, and, if you make a purchase through our Website, your credit card number, credit card security code, expiration date, billing address, and shipping address. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features, and you may not be able to complete a purchase through the Website. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to purchase items, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.

We do not direct any of our content specifically to children. Users of our Website are required to be at least 18 years old, and any user under 18 is not an authorized user. Additionally, if we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user.

**Personal information we collect automatically:**

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. Modnique automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, the page you requested, and any items you may purchase. This information may be used to customize the content you see on our Website or to communicate with you about specials and new features.
  * Usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components may also be used in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Modnique never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.



**E-mail Communications:**

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Modnique if your computer supports this type of program. Modnique uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by making a modification on your account page, or by using the "Unsubscribe" feature in any email we send to you.

**Mobile:**

When you download or use our mobile applications, or access one of our mobile optimized sites, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location based services, such as advertising, shipping information, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable location services in the device's setting's menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or the manufacture of your particular device.

**Information from other sources** :

We may receive or collect supplemental information about you from third parties sources and add it to our account information. This may include, but is not limited to, demographic, navigation information, additional contact information, credit check information, and additional information about you from credit bureaus or other sources, as permitted by law.

**What are Cookies?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Modnique cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what is your screen name or email address.
  * Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website's most attractive features.
  * We may use cookies to compile usage or "clickstream" information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows us to, among other things, deliver targeted content that we believe will be of most interest to you.



**Will Modnique share any of the Personal Information?**

Personal Information about our customers is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.

Moreover, if Modnique, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Modnique goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Modnique may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**How secure is my Personal Information?**

Your Modnique account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

When Modnique's order form asks users to enter Personal Information such as a credit card number, that information is encrypted with industry-standard Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") encryption to keep your online order safe and secure. When the letters "http" in the URL address change to "https", the "s" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL. Modnique also maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your Personal Information.

Modnique endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account information is kept private, however, Modnique cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
