Full Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy covers the privacy practices that Totango INC and it’s parent company Totango Metrics LTD (“Totango”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) employs in providing the Totango Service (the “Service”) to our customers, including their personnel (collectively, “Customer(s)”). It explains what data we collect, including Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), about (i) Customers; and (ii) the customers and clients of our Customers (“End Users”), and how we collect, use and retain such data. The use of information collected through our Service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Service for which our clients have engaged Totango.

Introduction:

We are committed to respecting privacy and recognize the need for appropriate protection and management of any Personally Identifiable Information that is shared with us as part of the Service. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, personal profile, a home or other physical address, an email address or other contact information.

Totango Service Description:

We provide the Service in order to enable our Customers to collect information about their End Users’ activities on our Customer’s web service and/or other software services offering (“Customer Service”) and to provide our Customers with a global view of those activities.

What Information We Collect and How We Collect It.

As the provider of the Service, we receive and/or collect data, which may contain Personally Identifiable Information, in the following ways:

3.1. Customer Account Information. As part of the Service, we may collect or obtain information (including Personally Identifiable Information) that a Customer provides about itself, such as the Customer’s account name, and email address, company information and related information about its personnel (“Customer Data”).

3.2. End User Data. As part of the Service, a Customer may provide us with data, including Personally Identifiable Information, such as a user’s email address to store on the Customer’s behalf about an End User in connection with the End User’s use of the Customer Service (“End User Data”). Totango has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. We work with our Customers to help them provide notice to their End Users concerning the purpose for which  
Personally Identifiable Information is collected. We may transfer Personally Identifiable Information to companies that help us provide our Service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers.

3.3. Transactions. We may collect or obtain information, including Personally Identifiable Information, from each Customer in order to complete the Customer’s subscription to the Service. Such information could include a credit card number, related account and billing information, and other data required to process the order. We may update such data should a Customer grant us permission to bill a credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case the terms of use and/or privacy policy of said third party service provider shall also apply to the transaction. These third party service providers are authorized to use your Personally Identifiable Information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

3.4. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Totango and our partners e.g. marketing partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers e.g. online customer support provider, etc. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

3.5. Analytics / Log Files. As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically using Analytics technology and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

3.6. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.  
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about  
your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

4.6. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active. We reserve the right to retain any Personally Identifiable Information, End User Data we process on behalf of our Customers and other Service- related data for such time as we are providing the Service to the Customer to which the information relates and for a reasonable time thereafter. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements

If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or if you no longer desire our Service, you may correct, update or amend by making the change in your account/profile settings page or by emailing our Customer Support. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. Totango has no direct relationship with the individual End Users’ personal data it may processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, delete inaccurate data or withdraw consent for further contact should direct his query to the Totango 

Customer they deal with directly. If the Customer requests Totango to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information or any information that we receive in connection with the Service if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; or (ii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Totango, our Customers, End Users, or the public.

In certain situations, Totango may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Anonymous Information.

We may use Anonymous Information (defined below), or disclose it to third party service providers, to provide, improve and/or develop the Service. From time to time, we may disclose Anonymous Information as part of our participation in an industry wide benchmark for the benefit of the online software community. Each Customer may opt-out from such benchmarks at any time by emailing us at privacy@totango.com. “Anonymous Information” means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information, about the use of the Service.

Children’s Privacy.

The Service is not structured to attract children under the age of 18. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personally Identifiable Information from anyone we know to be under 18 years.

In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Change of Control. 

We may transfer or assign this Privacy Policy and any Personally Identifiable Information to a third party entity that acquires or is merged with Totango as part of a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control (“Change of Control”). Should such a Change of Control occur, Totango will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the Personally Identifiable Information in a manner that is consistent with Totango’s privacy policies. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personally Identifiable Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personally Identifiable Information.

Security.

The security of Personally Identifiable Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personally  
Identifiable Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

We use SSL technology to encrypt data (such as your credit card information) during transmission, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize sensitive data. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Personally Identifiable Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Our Website offers a publicly accessible blog and a community support forum which allow user generated comments. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
