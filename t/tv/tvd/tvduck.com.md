In addition, we may transfer your PII to a successor entity upon a change of control of tvDuck, sale, merger, other corporate reorganization. Such successor entity will be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

**Email**  
Email addresses are used for identification, inviting new friends to tvDuck, searching for and finding friends, for general communication, and to send notifications to you.  To facilitate searching for and finding friends on the Site, tvDuck allows users to search for other members using text searches, first and last name, email address, and other attributes.  Users can invite friends to join tvDuck by sending invitation emails via our automated invitation system.  tvDuck stores these email addresses so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to establish relationships between users. tvDuck does not sell invitation email addresses or use them for any other purpose.
