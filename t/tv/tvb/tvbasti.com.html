<p>
TvBasti ("TVBasti") is committed to protecting its users' privacy. This Privacy 
Policy (the "Privacy Policy"), as set forth below, covers tvbasti.com ("tvbasti.com" 
or the "website") and applies solely to information collected on tvbasti.com . 
Please read this Privacy Policy to understand how we will treat personally and 
non-personally identifiable information we collect on tvbasti.com. This Privacy 
Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. <br>
<br>
<b>What personally identifiable information is collected from me?</b><br>
<br>
We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personally identifiable 
information collected about visitors to the Site. Except with respect to certain 
designated elements of the Site that require registration, you can use 
tvbasti.com without divulging any personally identifiable information, including 
your email address. The Site does not collect personally identifiable 
information about you unless you expressly provide such information to us on a 
voluntary basis. For example, you may provide your personally identifiable 
information to complete contest entry forms, to complete your registration on 
the Site or the various services offered on the Site, including community 
postings such as the tvbasti.com Community, chats and bulletin boards. Except as 
described below, in those instances in which you "opt-in" to receive offers 
directly from our third party partners, such personally identifiable information 
will never be shared with third parties outside of TVBasti and its affiliated 
companies or third party vendors acting on their behalf. <br>
<br>
We may, from time to time, give you the opportunity to receive special offers, 
such as newsletters, email reminders or special discounts, directly from 
companies with which we partner. In order to take advantage of these 
opportunities, you must affirmatively authorize us to share your personally 
identifiable information with these third party partners; we will never share 
such information unless you specifically "opt-in" to receive such an offer from 
one of our partners. Similarly, as part of certain sweepstakes entries we may 
also give you the opportunity to sign up to receive special offers from our 
advertising partners. Again, during the entry process, your information will be 
shared with our partners only if you take specific action to indicate that you 
would like us to do so. <br>
<br>
You may choose to provide us with the certain personally identifiable 
information when using the Site or the various services offered on the Site, 
including:<br>
<br>
* Your name<br>
* Online contact information (email address or phone number)<br>
* Your login information <br>
<br>
In addition, at times, we may ask you to provide non-personally identifiable 
information about yourself that may be linked with your personally identifiable 
information you provide. Provision of this information is optional. Such 
information includes:<br>
<br>
* Gender<br>
* Preferences (what you like or dislike)<br>
* Survey answers (votes and ratings of TV shows and Celebrities) <br>
<br>
<b>What non-personally identifiable information is collected automatically?</b><br>
<br>
We automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information from 
you to optimize our web pages for your computer such as<br>
<br>
* clickstream information (internet protocol ("IP") address, internet service 
provider, platform type, date/time stamp) http protocol information (last URL 
requested and browser type)<br>
* interaction information (browser interaction such as when the mouse moves over 
an image)<br>
* computer information (computer and browser information)<br>
* search terms (search text)<br>
* to collect such data we use Google Analytics, whose privacy policy is covered 
by Googles Privacy policy<br>
<br>
We may use such non-personally identifiable information for internal purposes, 
including, but not limited to, improving the content of the Site and the 
services offered on the Site. (See "How is my information used?")<br>
<br>
<b>How is my information used?</b><br>
<br>
We will use personally identifiable information that you submit to the Site for 
the purposes for which you submitted it. At the time you provide personally 
identifiable information, you have the option of instructing us not to send you 
our special email offers, and of affirmatively consenting to receiving email 
offers aboutour partners. <br>
<br>
We may disclose personally identifiable information when required by law or when 
we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a 
current judicial proceeding, court order, government investigation or legal 
process.<br>
<br>
We may use non-personally identifiable information collected on the Site to 
enhance the Site and our product offerings, to maintain and secure the Site, and 
to understand the interests of Site visitors. Generally, we use non-personally 
identifiable information to analyze trends, administer the website, and gather 
information for aggregate use (IP addresses are not linked to personally 
identifiable information).<br>
<br>
We may also use the statistical compilation and aggregation of non-personally 
identifiable information and may provide such information to third parties for 
marketing, advertising or research purposes.<br>
<br>
We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to any third party 
as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection 
with a merger or consolidation with such third party or the sale of some or all 
of our assets, provided that such third party agrees to comply with the 
then-current version of this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<b>How is my information kept secure? </b><br>
<br>
We maintain commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure the security, integrity 
and privacy of personally identifiable information submitted to our Sites, and 
we periodically review and update security measures in <br>
light of current technologies.<br>
<br>
<b>Profile Preferences</b><br>
<br>
You may change your personal profile preferences on the site at any time.<br>
<br>
<b>Email Policies</b><br>
<br>
By default, we send a weekly and sometimes bi-weekly newsletter updates 
regarding TV news stories, new features, and updates from TVBasti. We also send 
a variety of notification emails pertaining to your <br>
profile and your friends interactions with the site. You have full control over 
which emails you wish to receive, simply go to "My Profile" and edit your 
preferences.<br>
<br>
<b>Inviting Friends</b><br>
<br>
TVBasti is more fun with friends! The site is a community site made up of 
friendly TV lovers and is intended to be shared with friends; however, it is 
completely optional to invite friends. <br>
<br>
When inviting friends, we will send an email to the addresses you enter 
indicating it is a message from you so that they know it is coming from you. If 
a friend does not respond, we may send one or two reminder messages on your 
behalf. <br>
<br>
As an added convenience, TVBasti offers the ability import address books from 
Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail, and AOL. We access the address book only once for the 
sole purpose of retrieving your friends' information so that you can select who 
you would like to invite. We do not store any login details or use them for any 
other purpose than to retrieve your contacts. We never invite contacts that you 
do not explicitly select and no emails will be sent to your friends other than 
the invite email unless they register to join TVBasti. <br>
<br>
<b>What are cookies and how are they used by the Sites?</b><br>
<br>
Cookies are files that a web site places on an individual's hard-drive for 
record-keeping purposes. Cookies, which are an industry standard used by most 
web sites, can facilitate a user's ongoing access to and use of a site.<br>
<br>
Our cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in 
the domain that issued the cookie to you. We will not share or sell 
non-aggregated information contained within cookies with any third party. The 
cookie itself does not contain any personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a 
simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie 
feature, but you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you with 
such special features as customized content delivery. Cookies can be removed 
from your computer by following Internet browser "help" file directions.<br>
<br>
<b>Does TVBasti use Third Party Ad Servers?</b><br>
<br>
We use third party advertising companies and advertising networks to deliver 
advertisements on the Site. These companies may use cookies, web beacons, clear 
.gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help 
measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these 
technologies by these companies is subject to their own privacy policies and is 
not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you would like more information about 
this practice please visit www.networkadvertising.org.<br>
<br>
<b>Does TVBasti collect personally identifiable information from children?</b><br>
<br>
We ask that all parents spend time with their children and monitor what sites 
their children are visiting. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable 
information from children under the age of 13. We also suggest that no children 
under 18 submit personally identifiable information to any game, membership, 
contest or promotion that we might host without first obtaining a parent's 
consent. Our Site is not intended for use by and is not directed to children.<br>
<br>
<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy</b><br>
<br>
We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise 
the "last updated" date at the bottom of the Privacy Policy. For material 
changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice 
on the Site.<br>
<br>
