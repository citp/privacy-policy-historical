# Privacy Policy - TVWise

TVWise take issues surrounding privacy very seriously. The following policy lays out the type of information we collect on users of our site and how it is used. If you have any concerns regarding this policy you can email us at [privacy@tvwise.co.uk](mailto:privacy@tvwise.co.uk)

 **Cookies**

TVWise uses cookies for the purposes of identifying when you access our site. Doing this enables us to pre-populate your email address on the comment forms on our articles. You may disable cookies but it may affect your ability to use this site’s functions. We also collect general information about our users, such as IP addresses, operating systems, web browsers and internet service providers. This is done so we can better analyse the demographics of the users using our site as a whole.

TVWise’s advertising partners also use cookies on our site. These third-party advertisers may collect information, such as your IP address, through a variety of means (cookies, web beacons and JavaScript) to enable them to deliver more personalized advertising and to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. This is done by collating information of your internet history and determining which content is best suited for you. We have no access or control over the cookies or use of collected information by third parties.

Google AdSense currently utilises cookies on TVWise. More specifically they use DART Cookies. If you wish to learn more or opt out of using DART Cookies you may do so by visiting [this page](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/). When you click on advertisements provided by our third party partners you may be taken to another website. TVWise has no control over what content is displayed on such third party websites.

 **Personal Information**

When you comment on an article you are asked to enter an email address and name. In no instances will TVWise ever share your email address with any third parties. The name you provide for such comments will, however, be publicly viewable.
