**Email**   
It is the policy of TVNZ to send our viewers relevant emails about our service and other emails they elect to receive, in addition to customary business communications (payment confirmations, etc.). Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request. 

**Emailing Tools**   
TVNZ ondemand may provide facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to TVNZ ondemand or to send references to specific content to a friend. You may not use the "Email this episode to a Friend" service or other email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our privacy policy or [Conditions of Use](http://tvnzondemand.co.nz/content/ondemand_conditions_of_use) . We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email messages or the email addresses.

**TVNZ ondemand provides you with ways in which you can alter your personal data, including changing your password etc. TVNZ ondemand will store previous email addresses against your profile to ensure compliance with our [Conditions of Use](http://tvnzondemand.co.nz/content/ondemand_conditions_of_use) \- specifically the use of one account per member.

We also use them to deliver information and fresh content specific to your interests. Cookies are widely used on most major Web sites. 

TVNZ ondemand mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer once you leave TVNZ ondemand. These are used so our service can remember that you have logged in already and prevent you doing so more frequently. The technology we use sometimes requires the use of session cookies.

This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. 

Users who login have their IP addresses recorded. This information can be used to track users who abuse the TVNZ ondemand system and will be only be provided to legal authorities in cases of suspected fraud. IP addresses can be used, in conjunction with an Internet Service Provider, to find the dial-in account of a user and, ultimately, further information to identify a user. This information is stored securely and will not be provided to other viewers, members or non-authorised parties.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

**Membership Removal**

**Advertising and Third Party Links**

TVNZ ondemand may contain non-advertising links to a variety of third party sites to enhance the viewer experience. TVNZ ondemand has no control of either the content or privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links be considered an endorsement of these sites except where otherwise noted.

**Nielsen//NetRatings - NZ internet statistics**

To do this, TVNZ ondemand has a small piece of code on each page which counts these statistics. This enables us to see where we are in the list of New Zealand websites.
