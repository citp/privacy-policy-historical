# TV Licensing - TV Licensing’s privacy policy

'TV Licensing' is a trade mark of the BBC and is used under licence by companies contracted by the BBC to administer the collection of the television licence fee and enforcement of the television licensing system. We (the BBC) are a public authority in respect of our television licensing functions and we retain overall responsibility. We are also the data controller of personal data processed by TV Licensing.

We are committed to safeguarding your personal information. This commitment extends to our TV Licensing contractors and subcontractors. Whenever you provide us with your personal information, we are legally obliged to use it in line with all laws concerning the protection of such information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the "data protection laws"). The BBC is the data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998 in respect of our TV Licensing functions.

In order to identify you and communicate with you about TV Licensing matters you may be asked to provide:

  * Your name.
  * Your TV Licence number or membership number for cash payment schemes.
  * Your postal address(es).
  * Your bank account details or your credit/debit card details.
  * Your telephone number.
  * Information about whether or not you use a TV at an address.
  * Your National Insurance number (if applying for a free over 75 licence).
  * Other contact details such as an email address.
  * Cookies (via the TV Licensing website) may collect other information. Refer to section 4 for more details.



In addition to the information you provide us directly, we may also record the following information about you or obtain it from third parties:

  * Personal information and contact information about licensable properties, e.g. information about changes of address or telephone numbers, in order to administer the licensing system.
  * Details of any payments due, paid or overdue in respect of your licence.
  * We usually seek information about, or confirmation of, your age and National Insurance number from the Department for Work and Pensions if you apply for an over 75 licence.
  * As a quality control measure, telephone calls made to and from TV Licensing may be recorded or monitored for training purposes to ensure that we continuously improve our customer service standards. Recordings of telephone calls are only kept for a limited amount of time.
  * We may also collect information from third parties on whether a TV is being used at an address. An example of this is where we receive a notification from a TV Dealer that television receiving equipment has been purchased.
  * Information about any access restrictions to a particular property.
  * Where necessary, we may collect information (such as statements of evidence) relevant to any investigation or prosecution related to a TV licence offence.
  * Information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address (via the TV Licensing website). Refer to section 9 for more details.



We will only hold your personal information for as long as it is necessary to do so having regard to the purposes for which it was collected.

Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. Some are used to assess and improve the performance of a website based on how people are using it. Others are necessary to ensure you can transact or log in, for instance. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site – for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it won’t recognise you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.

Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages based for example, on your location and/or browsing habits.

Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’). You can learn more about the different types of cookies in Section 4.5.

#### 4.1. What is in a cookie?

A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each website can send its own cookie to your device. Each cookie is unique to your web browser and will contain some anonymous information such as a unique cookie id, the site you are browsing and a uniquely generated number that allows a website to remember your preferences or what’s in your shopping basket, for example.

#### 4.2. Can I browse the TV Licensing website without receiving any cookies?

Depending on the web-browser that you use to access our website, you may have the ability to accept or decline cookies locally within your browser. Options include accepting all cookies automatically, notifying you when a cookie is downloaded, or not receiving cookies at any time. These options may be found in the ‘preferences’ section of your web browser. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You may find the www.aboutcookies.org website useful for information on how to change cookie settings in a range of commonly used browsers. If you set your computer to reject cookies, you can still browse www.tvlicensing.co.uk and cashplans.tvlicensing.co.uk. However, certain functions will not be available to you including paying for your TV Licence and updating your details.

How can I control cookies?

#### 4.5. Types of cookies

##### 4.5.1. First Party Cookies

First party cookies are set by the website, or domain, you are visiting (e.g. www.tvlicensing.co.uk) and only that website can retrieve the information stored in those cookies. You can tell if a cookie is a first party cookie if the host domain for a cookie is the same as the one in the browser. Find out how to view cookies in your browser.

##### 4.5.2. Third Party Cookies

Third party cookies are set by an organisation other than TV Licensing. For example, TV Licensing uses a number of suppliers who set cookies on TV Licensing’s behalf in order to deliver the services that they are providing (e.g. reporting on visit volumes to a particular webpage). These will be third party cookies.

##### 4.5.2.1 How do third party organisations which display TV Licensing online communications use cookies?

We use a range of channels (including television, radio and online) in order to raise awareness, explain the law relating to TV Licensing, provide information about ways to pay and deter evaders.

Where online campaigns are used (for example, banners displayed on third party websites), a cookie will be sent to your browser from the third party website's computer and stored on your computer. These cookies are used for analytical purposes in order to monitor the interaction between, and effectiveness of, our online communications, letters and emails. We will ensure that cookies set by third parties on behalf of TV Licensing comply with the TV Licensing Privacy Policy and we will not collect personal data during this process. Find out more in Section 4.6 How does TV Licensing use cookies?

It is the responsibility of third party websites themselves to provide information about non-TV Licensing cookies that may be served from their site. We therefore recommend that you check the cookies policy of any external sites if you would like to know more about their use of cookies. If the host domain for a cookie is different to the one in the browser bar when it was downloaded, then it is a third party cookie.

##### 4.5.3. Session Cookies

Session Cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed.

##### 4.5.4. Persistent Cookies

This type of cookie is saved on your computer for a fixed period (usually a year or longer) and is not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where we need to identify your computer or device for more than one browsing session. For example, we use this type of cookie to count the number and frequency of repeat visits to the TV Licensing website.

Persistent cookies can also be used if we need to know who you are so that we can store your preferences and remember them for the next visit. TV Licensing does not currently use persistent cookies in this way.

##### 4.5.5. Web beacons, clear GIFs, page tags and web bugs

These are all terms used to describe a particular form of technology implemented by many sites in order to help them to understand and analyse how their site is being used and, in turn, to improve your experience of the site.

A web beacon usually takes the form of a small, transparent image, which is embedded in a web page or an email. They are used in conjunction with cookies and send information such as your IP address, when the page or email was viewed, from what device and which geo-location etc.

TV Licensing uses web beacons in emails to tell us if the email has been opened.

##### 4.5.6. Opting out of web beacons

As a web beacon forms part of a web page, it is not possible to ‘opt-out’ as such but you can render some of them ineffective by not downloading images in your email.

How can I view and control different types of cookies?

#### 4.6. How does TV Licensing use cookies?

##### 4.6.1.

Cookies enable us to identify your device and track its unique interaction with the TV Licensing website; we don’t use cookies to communicate with you as an individual or to create a personal profile of you. We use cookies that are **strictly necessary** to enable you to move around the site or to provide certain features you have requested, for instance to pay for your TV Licence or update your details. We also use cookies to help us to measure and improve the **performance** of our website to provide you with a better user experience and measure the effectiveness of our online communications, letters and emails.

The next section (4.7) explains these categories of cookie and provides a list of the cookies set by the TV Licensing website along with an explanation of what each of those cookies is used for.

The information collected by cookies will be used in the same way as other information that we collect about you – provided in section 5.

##### 4.6.2.

If you wish to control what cookies are set on your device through the TV Licensing website then you can find out how to do this in Section 4.8 How can I view and control cookies?

#### 4.7. Categories of cookies used on the TV Licensing website

##### 4.7.1. Strictly Necessary Cookies

Some cookies are strictly necessary in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, certain features that you have asked for, such as being able to make a payment or log into your account, cannot be provided.

This table lists the strictly necessary cookies that are set by TV Licensing:

Cookie Name | Purpose  
---|---  
ASP.NET_SessionId | This cookie is used to create a unique session identifier (a random number specific just to your session on the website) so that we can store the data regarding your session. This cookie expires at the end of your session (when you leave the TV Licensing website) and will be removed when you close your browser.  
BIGipServertvl-vpwm-web-vip | Because our website uses more than one server, this cookie is used to make sure all the activity within your visit is directed to the same server. This cookie expires at the end of your session (when you leave the TV Licensing website) and will be removed when you close your browser.  
  
##### 4.7.2. Performance Cookies

We use Performance Cookies for internal purposes to help us to provide you with a better user experience. Information supplied by cookies helps us to understand how our visitors use the TV Licensing website so that we can improve how we present our content to you. They allow us to test different design ideas for particular pages, such as the TV Licensing home page. We also use data collected by cookies for analytical purposes in order to monitor the interaction between, and effectiveness of, our online communications, letters and emails. These cookies allow us to analyse which pages customers have visited on our site and whether customers have reached the website via our promotional banners on third party sites. If you log in or make a transaction on the TV Licensing website, the data collected may be matched back to the TV Licensing database for analytical purposes. We analyse customer journeys collectively in this way to help us improve your online experience with TV Licensing. We generally use independent measurement and research companies to perform these services for us and when this is the case, these cookies are set by a third party company.

##### 4.7.3. List of Performance Cookies

This table lists the performance cookies that are used by TV Licensing all of which are set by our third party measurement and research companies:

Cookie Name or Type | Purpose

These tags read the data provided by the Doubleclick "id" cookie and by other suppliers served at different times on our behalf. These cookies are used to measure the effectiveness of online campaigns for TV Licensing by measuring customer activity on the TV Licensing website once the user has viewed online TV Licensing communications. These cookies allow us to analyse which pages customers have visited on our site and whether customers have reached the website via our promotional banners on third party sites. If you log in or make a transaction on the TV Licensing website, the data collected may be matched back to the TV Licensing database for analytical purposes.

The majority of personal data we hold is processed within the UK. However, some data is processed outside of the European Economic Area. We only allow the processing of personal data outside of the European Economic Area when we are satisfied that there is an appropriate level of protection for our customers’ personal data and where appropriate contractual obligations and safeguards have been put in place.

#### 5.2. Will we share your personal information with anyone else?

We will never sell your data to anyone. Any information you provide will only be used by us and our service providers for the purposes of administering TV Licensing. We will not disclose your data to any other third parties without obtaining your prior consent unless we are required or permitted to do so by law (for example, to law enforcement agencies).

#### 5.3. Will my personal information be kept secure?

We take Information Security extremely seriously. We will take all appropriate measures to ensure that all personal information that is under our control is held securely and in accordance with relevant data protection laws. We use strict procedures and security features to prevent any unauthorised access to, or misuse or loss of, your personal information.

Please note that unless encrypted, email messages are not secure and therefore could be intercepted and read by someone else. Please bear this in mind when deciding whether to include personal or sensitive information in any email messages you send to us.

#### 5.4. When will we send you emails and text messages?

##### 5.4.1. Email

There are a number of different ways you can receive emails from TV Licensing.

  1. **Receiving an electronic copy of your TV Licence**

When purchasing your licence you can choose to have it sent to you via email. Please see the TV Licensing website for answers to frequently asked questions on receiving your licence via email.

  2. **Receiving your TV Licence renewal reminders and other important information by email**
    1. If you purchased your licence via the TV Licensing website when purchasing a TV Licence at www.tvlicensing.co.uk you are required to provide a valid email address. We may then email you other messages regarding your TV Licence including reminders that your licence is about to expire. If you would prefer to receive these messages by post rather than email you can change your communication preferences via one of the methods set out in section 5.5.
    2. If you did not purchase your licence via the TV Licensing website, you can change the way you receive messages from TV Licensing (including choosing to receive messages via email) by [updating your details](https://web.archive.org/yourlicence/) or by contacting us by phone, email or post.
  3. **Receiving information relating to your licence instalment payment plan by email**

When choosing to pay for your licence via an instalment payment plan, you may choose to have information relating to that payment plan sent to you via email. Customer email addresses will not be sold to anyone. Nor will they be used by, distributed to, or shared with anyone other than the BBC and its service providers in connection with TV Licensing. If you choose to provide us with an email address then it is your responsibility to ensure that it is valid and to notify TV Licensing of any changes. You can [change your email address online](https://web.archive.org/yourlicence/) or via phone or post.




##### 5.4.2. Text Messages

If you provide us with your mobile phone number, we will only use it to contact you via text message if we have your consent to do so.

#### 5.5. How do I stop receiving emails and/or text messages?

There are a number of ways in which you can stop (i.e. unsubscribe from) receiving emails and/or text messages from TV Licensing (refer to 5.5.1-5.5.3.). When you unsubscribe from either text message and/or email communications, we will record your decision and will not use your email address or mobile phone number for such messages unless you decide to subscribe to such communications again (refer to 5.6).

You can unsubscribe from email contact at any point (refer to 5.5.3). However, if you do so less than a month before your current TV Licence expires the changes may not come into effect in time to receive a renewal reminder by post so you may still receive your reminder by email. This is because it takes up to four weeks to change your preferences from email to postal communications.

##### 5.5.1. Unsubscribe via the TV Licensing website

You can [unsubscribe from receiving emails from TV Licensing by updating your details via the website](https://web.archive.org/yourlicence/) and following the instructions.

##### 5.5.2. Unsubscribe via phone or post

##### 5.5.3. Unsubscribe via the instructions contained in the emails / texts themselves.

You may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions included within any email or text message that we send to you. Please note that a minority of texts and emails (e.g. receipts for electronic payment) will not contain unsubscribe instructions. If the text or email you receive does not contain an unsubscribe link, you are still able to unsubscribe by using the methods set out at 5.5.1-5.5.2.

#### 5.6. How do I start receiving emails and/or text messages if I’ve previously asked for those messages to be stopped?

If you want to start receiving text messages again simply contact us using the methods described in 5.5.2. To start receiving emails again, [update your details on the website](https://web.archive.org/yourlicence/) or contact us using the methods described in 5.5.2.

Under the [Data Protection Act 1998](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents) you have the right to request copies of the personal information we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. This is known as a subject access request. We charge £10 for copies of personal information and you are required to prove your identity with two pieces of approved identification:

  * A copy of passport or photocard drivers’ licence; and
  * A copy of a bank statement or utility bill dated within the last 3 months.

Technical information is gathered about you without you actively providing it through the use of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), so you can access the Internet.

We log the IP address of any user visiting the website, but this data is not used to develop a personal profile of you.

We use web analytics to analyse site usage and statistics but this application does not identify any personal information. Using web analytics helps us to understand usage patterns on our website and to make improvements to our service.
