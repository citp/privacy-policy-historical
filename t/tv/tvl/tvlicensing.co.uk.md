# Official TV Licensing website - TV Licensing privacy and security policies

'TV Licensing' is a trade mark of the BBC and is used by the BBC in respect of its TV Licensing functions and under licence by companies contracted by the BBC to administer the collection of the television licence fee and enforcement of the television licensing system. The BBC is a public authority in respect of its television licensing functions and is the data controller retaining overall responsibility.

We (TV Licensing) are committed to safeguarding personal information that you provide to us. This commitment extends to our TV Licensing contractors and subcontractors. Whenever you provide (or someone acting on your behalf provides) us with your personal information, we are legally obliged to use it in line with all laws concerning the protection of such information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the "data protection laws").

Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. Some are used to assess and improve the performance of a website based on how people are using it. Others are necessary to ensure you can transact or log in, for instance. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site – for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it won’t recognise you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.

Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising messages, based for example, on your location and/or browsing habits.

Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’). You can learn more about the [different types of cookies in Section 4.5](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.5).

####  4.1. What is in a cookie?

A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website so that the information contained in that cookie can be retrieved later. Each website can send its own cookie to your device. Each cookie is unique to your web browser and will contain some anonymous information such as a unique cookie id, the site you are browsing and a uniquely generated number that allows a website to remember your preferences or what’s in your shopping basket, for example.

####  4.2. Can I browse the TV Licensing website without receiving any cookies?

Depending on the web browser that you use to access our website, you may have the ability to accept or decline cookies locally within your browser. Options include accepting all cookies automatically, notifying you when a cookie is downloaded, or not receiving cookies at any time. These options may be found in the ‘preferences’ section of your web browser. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You may find the [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) website useful for information on how to change cookie settings in a range of commonly used browsers. If you set your computer to reject cookies, you can still browse www.tvlicensing.co.uk. However, certain functions will not be available to you, including paying for your TV Licence and updating your details.

####  4.5. Types of cookies

#####  4.5.1. First Party Cookies

First party cookies are set by the website, or domain, you are visiting (e.g. tvlicensing.co.uk) and only that website can retrieve the information stored in those cookies. You can tell if a cookie is a first party cookie if the host domain for a cookie is the same as the one in the browser. [Find out how to view cookies in your browser](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.8).

#####  4.5.2. Third Party Cookies

Third party cookies are set by an organisation other than TV Licensing. For example, TV Licensing uses a number of suppliers who set cookies on TV Licensing’s behalf in order to deliver the services that they are providing (e.g. reporting on visit volumes to a particular webpage or displaying an advertisement on other websites to encourage people to buy a licence or change their details). These will be third party cookies.

#####  4.5.2.1 How do third party organisations which display TV Licensing online communications use cookies?

We use a range of channels (including television, radio and online) in order to raise awareness, explain the law relating to TV Licensing, provide information about ways to pay and deter evaders.

Where online communications are used (for example, banners displayed on other websites by third parties acting on behalf of TV Licensing), a cookie will be sent to your browser from the other website and stored on your computer. These cookies are used for analytical purposes in order to monitor the interaction between, and effectiveness of, our online communications, letters and emails.  We will ensure that cookies set by third parties on behalf of TV Licensing comply with the TV Licensing Privacy Policy and we will not collect personal data during this process. [Find out more in section 4.6 How does TV Licensing use cookies?](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.6)

It is the responsibility of third party websites themselves to provide information about non-TV Licensing cookies that may be served from their site. We therefore recommend that you check the cookies policy of any external sites if you would like to know more about their use of cookies. If the host domain for a cookie is different to the one in the browser bar when it was downloaded, then it is a third party cookie.

#####  4.5.3. Session Cookies

Session Cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed.

#####  4.5.4. Persistent Cookies

This type of cookie is saved on your computer for a fixed period (usually a year or longer) and is not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where we need to identify your computer or device for more than one browsing session. For example, we use this type of cookie to count the number and frequency of repeat visits to the TV Licensing website.

Persistent cookies can also be used if we need to know who you are so that we can store your preferences and remember them for the next visit. TV Licensing does not currently use persistent cookies in this way.

#####  4.5.5. Web beacons, clear GIFs, page tags and web bugs

These are all terms used to describe a particular form of technology implemented by many sites in order to help them to understand and analyse how their site is being used and, in turn, to improve your experience of the site.

A web beacon usually takes the form of a small, transparent image, which is embedded in a web page or an email. They are used in conjunction with cookies and send information such as your IP address, when the page or email was viewed, from what device and which geographic location.

TV Licensing uses web beacons in emails to tell us if the email has been opened.

#####  4.5.6. Opting out of web beacons

As a web beacon forms part of a web page, it is not possible to ‘opt-out’ as such but you can render some of them ineffective by not downloading images in your email.

[How can I view and control different types of cookies?](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.8)

####  4.6. How does TV Licensing use cookies?

#####  4.6.1.

Cookies enable us to identify your device and track its unique interaction with the TV Licensing website; we don’t use cookies to communicate with you as an individual or to create a personal profile of you. We use cookies that are **strictly necessary** to enable you to move around the site or to provide certain features you have requested - for instance, to pay for your TV Licence or update your details. We also use cookies to help us to measure and improve the **performance** of our website to provide you with a better user experience and measure the effectiveness of our online communications, letters and emails. Finally, we may also use **advertising** cookies in order to present more relevant advertisements on other websites to customers who’ve previously visited the TV Licensing website and who may not have completed a transaction, and then analyse the results.

The [next section (4.7)](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.7) explains these categories of cookie and provides a list of the cookies set by the TV Licensing website along with an explanation of what each of those cookies is used for.

#####  4.6.2.

If you wish to control what cookies are set on your device through the TV Licensing website, then you can find out how to do this in [Section 4.8 How can I view and control cookies?](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#4.8)

####  4.7. Categories of cookies used on the TV Licensing website

---|---  
  
  * JSESSIONID
  * TVL-JSESSIONID

This cookie expires at the end of your session (when you leave the TV Licensing website) and will be removed when you close your browser.  
  
  * ROUTEID
  * SSROUTEID
  * CSROUTEID

|  Because our website uses more than one server, this cookie is used to make sure all the activity within your visit is directed to the same server pair. This cookie expires at the end of your session (when you leave the TV Licensing website) and will be removed when you close your browser.  
X-Mapping |  This cookie is used to keep your browser's session intact and will be removed when you close your browser.

#####  4.7.2. Performance Cookies

We use Performance Cookies for internal purposes to help us to provide you with a better user experience. Information supplied by cookies helps us to understand how our visitors use the TV Licensing website so that we can improve how we present our content to you. They allow us to test different design ideas for particular pages, such as the TV Licensing home page. We also use data collected by cookies for analytical purposes in order to monitor the interaction between, and effectiveness of, our online communications, letters and emails. These cookies allow us to analyse which pages customers have visited on our site and whether customers have reached the website via our promotional banners on third party sites. If you log in or make a transaction on the TV Licensing website, the data collected may be matched back to the TV Licensing database for analytical purposes. We analyse customer journeys collectively in this way to help us improve our customers' online experience with TV Licensing. We generally use independent measurement and research companies to perform these services for us and, when this is the case, these cookies are set by a third party company.

#####  4.7.3. List of Performance Cookies

This table lists the performance cookies that are used by TV Licensing all of which are set by our third party measurement and research companies:

Cookie Name or Type |  Purpose  
---|---

ACOOKIE |  This cookie is used to anonymously track your session by the WebTrends Data Collector domain to improve the WebTrends Analytics reporting when sites span multiple domains. This cookie expires after 2 years.  
Doubleclick |  Our online media partner uses Doubleclick 'Floodlight Tags' on specific pages on the TV Licensing website to allow cookies to be set on a user's browser. These tags read the data provided by the Doubleclick "id" cookie and by other suppliers served at different times on our behalf. These cookies are used to measure the effectiveness of TV Licensing's online communications (e.g. banners) by measuring customer activity on the TV Licensing website once the user has viewed online TV Licensing communications. If you log in or make a transaction on the TV Licensing website, the data collected may be matched back to the TV Licensing database for analytical purposes. We analyse customer journeys collectively in this way to help us improve our customers' online experience with TV Licensing.  
  
#####  4.7.4. Advertising Cookies

Our online media partner uses advertising cookies to determine if a particular browser has visited the TV Licensing website and whether a transaction has taken place (e.g. a licence sale or change of details).

#####  4.8.1 Web browser cookies

If you wish to view, restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device then you can do this through your browser settings. The Help function within your browser should tell you how.

Please refer to [5.4](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.4)-[5.6](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.6) for further details on [how we manage emails and text messages](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.4). We may communicate with you by phone using an automated recorded message: if you are contacted this way then you can unsubscribe at any time and can always choose to speak to a real person if you need to;
  * To discuss with you, investigate, or otherwise process any complaint, freedom of information request, subject access request (refer to [section 8 regarding the holding of personal information](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#8)) or other correspondence you have initiated with us;

  * To invite you to participate in surveys, which may be automated, about TV Licensing services (participation is always voluntary) and process the results; and
  * For other purposes relating to TV licensing (for example, confirming that no TV Licence is needed at your premises or that your property is currently unoccupied).
  * We may also use and disclose information in aggregate (so that no individual customers are identified) for the following purposes: 
    * To report on our performance, both internally and to the BBC Trust.

    * For historical, statistical or research purposes.
    * To assist in developing better ways of administering the TV Licensing system.



The majority of personal data we hold is processed within the UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. However, some data is processed outside of the European Economic Area. We only allow the processing of personal data outside of the European Economic Area when we are satisfied that there is an appropriate level of protection for our customers’ personal data and where appropriate contractual obligations and safeguards have been put in place.

####  5.2. Will we share your personal information with anyone else?

We will never sell your data to anyone. Any information you provide will only be used by us for the purposes of collecting and enforcing the TV licence fee. TV Licensing sometimes uses other suppliers to provide services that require them to process your personal information e.g. to append additional information - for example, whether there has been a change of occupancy at an address. When this happens, such companies are contractually required to follow our instructions, including keeping your data secure, and complying with the data protection laws where relevant. Similarly, we may collect information from, or share information with, other parts of the BBC. Your data would still only be used for the purposes of collecting and enforcing the licence fee.

We will not disclose your data to any other third parties without obtaining your prior consent unless we are required or permitted to do so by law (for example, to law enforcement agencies or organisations to which we are accountable).

####  5.3. Will my personal information be kept secure?

We take Information Security extremely seriously. We will take all appropriate measures to ensure that all personal information that is under our control is held securely and in accordance with relevant data protection laws. We use strict procedures and security features to prevent any unauthorised access to, or misuse or loss of, your personal information.

Please note that unless encrypted, email messages are not secure and therefore could be intercepted and read by someone else. Please bear this in mind when deciding whether to include personal or sensitive information in any email messages you send to us.

####  5.4. When will we send you emails and text messages?

#####  5.4.1. Email

There are a number of different emails you may receive from TV Licensing.

  1. **Receiving an electronic copy of your TV Licence**

When paying for your licence, you can choose to have an online version of it sent to you via a link in an email. We'll then send you an email for you to log in to your licence online. You can then save your licence to your device, or print a copy.

  2. **Receiving your TV Licence renewal reminders and other important information by email**
    1. If you pay for your licence via the TV Licensing website tvlicensing.co.uk, you are required to provide a valid email address. We may then email you other messages regarding your TV Licence, including reminders that your licence is about to expire. If you would prefer to receive these messages by post rather than email, you can [change your communication preferences via one of the methods described in section 5.5](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.5).
    2. Whether or not you paid for your licence via the TV Licensing website, you can change the way you receive messages from TV Licensing (including choosing to receive messages via email) by [updating your details](https://web.archive.org/cs/update/multiple-changes/index.app) or by contacting us by phone, email or post.
    3. If you provide your email address to us when writing to us, we will take this as an indication that you are happy for us to send you email communications relating to TV Licensing. You can unsubscribe at any time as explained in section 5.5. 

If you choose to provide us with an email address, it is your responsibility to ensure that it is valid and to notify TV Licensing of any changes. You can [change your email address online](https://web.archive.org/cs/update/multiple-changes/index.app) or via phone or post.

  3. **If you agree to take part in Customer Research surveys by email.**

You can unsubscribe from Customer Research surveys by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in the survey email.




#####  5.4.2. Text Messages

If you provide us with your mobile phone number, we will only use it to contact you via text message if we have your consent to do so.

You may also receive texts if you pay for your TV Licence by cash instalments, which means you can pay via SMS at your convenience, as we have your card details securely stored and encrypted.

####  5.5. How do I stop receiving emails and/or text messages?

There are a number of ways in which you can stop (i.e. unsubscribe from) receiving emails and/or text messages from TV Licensing (refer to [5.5.1](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.5.1)-[5.5.3](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.5.3).). When you unsubscribe from either text message and/or email communications, we will record your decision and will not use your email address or mobile phone number for such messages unless you decide to subscribe to such communications again (refer to [5.6](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.6)).

You can unsubscribe from email contact at any point (refer to [5.5.3](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.5.3)). However, if you do so less than a month before your current TV Licence expires, the changes may not come into effect in time to receive a renewal reminder by post, so you may still receive your reminder by email while our systems are being updated.

Market Research emails that you have consented to receive can be stopped by unsubscribing from them.

You can [unsubscribe from receiving emails](https://web.archive.org/cs/update/multiple-changes/index.app) from TV Licensing by updating your details via the website and following the instructions.

If the text or email you receive does not contain an unsubscribe link, you are still able to unsubscribe by using the methods set out at [5.5.1](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.5.1)-[5.5.2](https://web.archive.org/web/20171216071957id_/http%3A//www.tvlicensing.co.uk/privacy-security-policies#5.5.2).

####  9.1. Links to other websites

The TV Licensing website may contain links and references to other websites. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites and we encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of the other websites you visit.

####  9.2. Internet Protocol Addresses

Technical information is gathered about you without you actively providing it through the use of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), so you can access the Internet. In most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing from time to time as you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). We log the IP address of any user visiting the website, but this data is not used to develop a personal profile of you.

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. New versions will be posted on the TV Licensing website. If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our website.
