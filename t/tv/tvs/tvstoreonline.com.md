**Why Do We Need to Know About You?**

To ship products to you we need information, including your name, shipping address and credit card number. We use this information to ship your products to you, and for nothing else. We ask for your E-mail address and other contact information so that we can contact you if there are problems with your order, and to send you status information about your order.

We do not give out or sell any of our customers' personal information to anyone outside our company for any reason.

**Who Sees Your Credit Card?**

We are partnered with Yahoo! merchant solutions to provide our customers with safety and security.

Your credit card number is secure with us. We use your credit card to process your order and only for that purpose. Our site supports secure transmissions any time you send us sensitive data -- such as your credit card number or information -- and we use internal security measures to insure authorized access only to personal information. 

What about the other data that you give to us? It goes nowhere else. We don't give, sell, or lend your personal information to any other person, business, or website. Not for any reason.
