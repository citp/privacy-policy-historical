<h4>Privacy Policy </h4>
<p>PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY </p>
<p>Protecting your privacy, along with financial transactions, is at the core 
  of TVG's business. This notice describes the type of personally identifiable 
  information we collect and how we use such information. </p>
<p>TYPE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED </p>
<p>We collect, retain and use information about you to protect and administer 
  your account and funds; to comply with applicable state and federal laws and 
  regulations; and to help us design, improve and provide products and services 
  in order to better serve you. When you subscribe as a TVG customer or when you 
  submit a request or electronically pass information to TVG, you are sometimes 
  asked to provide certain information, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing 
  address, telephone numbers, social security number, birth date, credit card 
  or bank account information. We ask for this in order to facilitate your requests, 
  provide personalized services and communicate separately with you. Without your 
  written or electronic consent, we will not collect personal information over 
  our system unless it is necessary to provide you with our services or to prevent 
  unauthorized access to our services. </p>
<p>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION </p>
<p>You have chosen to do business with us, and we recognize our obligation to 
  keep the information you provide to us secure and confidential. In our continuous 
  effort to provide services that we believe you may find useful or of value, 
  we may make your records available to better facilitate your requests, provide 
  more personalized services and communicate separately with you. From time to 
  time, we will use the information we collect to coordinate data entry and payments 
  with the company that provides you with handicapping information, to coordinate 
  marketing/rewards programs with partner racetracks, and to offer other enhancements 
  to the service. Any third party receiving such information will have an obligation 
  to hold it confidential. Without your written or electronic consent or where 
  necessary to provide our services, we will not disclose your personally identifiable 
  data to other companies outside of TVG or our affiliated companies. TVG does 
  not currently sell customer information to advertisers or third party marketers. 
  If we choose to do so in the future, we will provide you with information about 
  how to remove your name from such lists. You will be provided with at least 
  thirty (30) days within which to remove your name from such lists. If you would 
  prefer that we not share any of your information with third parties, except 
  under the circumstances where we are legally required, please contact us in 
  writing at TVG Network, 19545 NW Von Neumann Drive, Suite 210, Beaverton, OR 
  97006-6935 to this effect. In circumstances where we inadvertently obtain information 
  that appears to pertain to the commission of a crime or where we reasonably 
  believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical 
  injury to any person exists, TVG may voluntarily disclose the record or the 
  contents of your communications or other information about you to law enforcement 
  agencies and governmental entities without providing you advance notice. Upon 
  receipt of an applicable search warrant or administrative, grand jury or trial 
  subpoena, TVG may be required to disclose to the government or law enforcement 
  agencies, without advance notice to you, the content of your communications 
  and other records relating to your electronic communications, as well as the 
  following records: your name and address; records of your online communication 
  (including session times and duration); how long you have subscribed to our 
  service(s) (including start date) and the type(s) of service(s) utilized; your 
  telephone number or other subscriber account identifying number(s), including 
  any Internet or network address(es) assigned to you by our network; and the 
  means and source of your payment(s) (including any credit card or bank account 
  number). </p>
<p>PROTECTING ONLINE ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS </p>
<p>When you apply online to establish an account, access services or utilize online 
  wagering, you provide personal and confidential information that is necessary 
  for us to process your request. To ensure that your information remains confidential, 
  the information is sent to us in a "secure session." Using the industry standard, 
  Secure Socket Layer (SSL)-capable web browsers support encryption technology 
  that helps prevent unauthorized users from viewing or manipulating your account 
  information as it travels over the Internet. We will permit only authorized 
  parties, who are trained in the proper handling of customer information, to 
  have access to that information. Employees who violate our privacy policy will 
  be subject to our disciplinary process. </p>
<p>RETENTION </p>
<p>We destroy customer information that is no longer necessary for the purpose 
  for which it is collected unless there is a legitimate request or order to inspect 
  the information still outstanding or the information remains in routine records 
  that are periodically discarded under our document retention policies. The information 
  that you have provided us is maintained in our management information system 
  and billing systems, and is updated as new information is added. Accounting 
  and billing records are retained for ten years for tax and accounting purposes 
  or until the relevant income tax years for which the document was created have 
  been closed for income tax purposes and/or all appeals have been exhausted. 
  Records may remain on file even after you have terminated service. Subject to 
  applicable law, we may also keep records to facilitate collection and to evaluate 
  credit worthiness. </p>
<p>YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES </p>
<p>It is extremely important that you keep your account number, Personal Identification 
  Number and other confidential account data protected and secure. Do not share 
  your PIN or leave your computer unattended during an online wagering session. 
  Please make sure that all information you provide to TVG is accurate and complete. 
  Contact us immediately by email at comments@tvg.com, or by calling 1-888-PLAY-TVG 
  if you find any discrepancies in your account data or if you wish to inspect 
  the records pertaining to you at our offices. </p>
<p>THIRD PARTY WEB SITES </p>
<p>TVG's website contains links to other sites. TVG cannot be responsible for 
  the privacy practices or the content of other web sites. When linking to other 
  sites, please review their security and privacy policies. </p>
<p>RESPONSIBLE WAGERING </p>
<p>TVG is a recognized leader in the area of responsible wagering. TVG does not 
  solicit any information from or market our services to anyone under the age 
  of 21. National Gambling Helpline: 1-800-522-4700 We reserve the right to revise 
  this policy, or any part thereof. Use of our service following notice of such 
  revisions constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy. </p>
