  <h1>TVA Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="body"> Thank you for visiting the Tennessee Valley Authority Web site and reviewing our privacy policy. The privacy of visitors to our site is important to us. This statement informs you of how we use information that may be collected when you visit TVA on the Web.</p>
  <p class="body">We will automatically gather and store certain information about your visit even if you simply browse through the Web site, read pages, or download documents. Our Web server automatically recognizes your browser’s domain name and IP address, but it does not recognize your e-mail address. The information we gather does not identify you personally but allows us to compile statistical data about the pages that our visitors view. That helps us determine the areas of our Web site that interest users and improve the navigation and content of the site.</p>
  <p class="body"> We do not attempt to identify individuals, nor do we track or record data about individuals or their visits. We collect no personal information about you unless you provide it to us. If you send us electronic mail or subscribe to any of our e-mail alert services, you are providing personal information (your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address, for example). We must record these data so we can direct your communication to the people who will respond to your request (although TVA may not be able to respond to every message it receives). We do not use persistent “cookies” to collect personally identifiable information about the individuals who access our Web pages and do not sell any personal information to third parties. However, we may monitor and audit usage of our Web site and may capture and transfer personal information to legal authorities if we suspect that your use of our Web site is in violation of federal or local laws. </p>
