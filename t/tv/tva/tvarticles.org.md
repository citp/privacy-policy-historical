**Comments**

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

**Media**

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

Our site uses a contact us form located at the top of the page to help users inform us about their opinions or to inform us about any problem that they are facing on our site. We do not use the information submitted through the contact us form for any marketing purposes. The data that you submit through the contact us form is kept for a certain period for customer service purposes only and is disposed of after the issue has been resolved.
