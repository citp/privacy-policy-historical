# Privacy Policy: Highlights

### T-Mobile Privacy Policy

November 21, 2012   
Please click here for Spanish version of the T-Mobile Privacy Policy   
Please click here for the T-Mobile Privacy Policy Highlights

T-Mobile USA, Inc. ("T-Mobile") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our privacy practices and provides other important privacy information, such as when and how we may change this Policy, and how you can contact us with any questions or comments.

  


We collect information about you and your associated device(s) and how you use them when you use our products or services or otherwise interact with us. Examples of the types of information we collect include:

**Personal Information**

"Personal Information" means information that we directly associate with a specific person or entity (for example, name; addresses; telephone numbers; email address; Social Security Number; call records; wireless device location). Personal information does not include “de-identified,” “anonymous,” or “aggregate” information – which are not associated with a specific person or entity.

**Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)**

Customer Proprietary Network Information, or "CPNI", is a subset of Personal Information that is generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you. CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number.

For more information see [Privacy Resources/Customer Proprietary](https://web.archive.org/Company/PrivacyResources.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_CPNI) Network Information

**Credit and Financial Information**

We collect information about your credit card or banking information, Social Security Number, and credit history for account opening, management and billing and collection purposes. Financial information we collect is governed by T-Mobile’s [Financial Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/Cms/Files/Published/0000BDF20016F5DD010312E2BDE4AE9B/5657114502E70FF30124DE7B5D9A9D91/file/Financial%20Privacy%20Policy%20Feb%202012%20Final.pdf)

**Network and Device Information**

We collect information about your use of our network and the device(s) associated with your account, network data related to WiFi usage and device, and performance information, as well as data relating to your use of our website, applications and other products and services.

**Location Data**

We may collect your device's approximate location whenever it is turned on (subject to coverage limitations).

**Performance and Diagnostic Data**

We may collect performance and diagnostic data about your use of our network, WiFi services or your device. For example, we may collect information about the performance of the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, battery strength and other device or network performance issues. We may also collect information about applications on your device, the fact that an application has been added, when an application is launched or fails to launch, and length of time an application has been running.

**Video Data**

When you use a T-Mobile video application, for example T-Mobile TV, on your device, we may collect information about the programs you watch to determine customer viewing habits so that we can tailor video selections to our customers.

**Back Up and Cloud Services**

Some devices may automatically upload to T-Mobile network servers information you have stored on the device and/or SIM card in order to facilitate specific functions. For instance, some devices may back-up your address book, photo album, or diagnostic data. You may choose to disable such uploads, but this may affect functionality of the device or your services. We may also provide you the ability to upload other information from your device to T-Mobile network servers. For instance, you may have the option to upload pictures, text messages, recordings, calendars, tasks, or notes.

**Collection of Information About Children**

We do not knowingly solicit to children to purchase our services or products. If, however, you authorize a child to use our services or products by providing them a device associated with your T-Mobile account, any information associated with such use will be treated as your information in accordance with this Policy. If you are the primary account holder, you will have the ability to set the marketing preferences for any other lines on your account, including those for any children to whom you provide a device.

Our websites are not designed to attract children under the age of 13 and we do not intentionally or knowingly collect Personal Information on our websites from anyone under the age of 13. We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities (including wireless Internet browsing) of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission.

T-Mobile collects information about you in three primary ways:

**Information You Provide**

We collect information that you provide to us when you apply for or purchase our products or services and use them, or otherwise communicate with us.

For example, some of the ways you may provide information to us include: 

  * When you sign up for our voice or data services or purchase other products or services, we may collect personal contact, billing, and credit information.
  * When you establish or modify an online account, we may collect user identification, passwords, and/or security question responses that you will use for future sign-on.
  * When you interact with our customer service representatives, enter information on our websites, submit survey responses, or pay for services, we may also collect Personal Information and other information. We may monitor and record phone calls, e-mails, live chats, or other communications between you, your device, and our customer service representatives or other employees or representatives.



**Information We Collect Automatically**

We automatically collect a variety of information associated with your use of your device (on our network or in WiFi mode) and our products and services, some of which may be associated with you or another user on your account.

For example, some of the ways we may automatically collect information include: 

  * Our systems capture details about the type and location of wireless device(s) you use, when the device is turned on, calls and text messages you send and receive (but not the content of those calls or messages), and other data services you use.
  * We may also gather information about the performance of your device and our network. Some examples of the types of data collected include: the applications on the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, and other device or network performance issues.
  * **Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies**

We may use, or we may engage third-parties to use on our behalf, cookies (small data text files placed on your computer or device) or similar technologies to identify your computer or device and record your preferences and other data so that our websites can personalize your visit(s).

We may also use Web beacons (small graphic images on a Web page or an HTML e-mail) to monitor interaction with our websites or e-mails. Web beacons are generally invisible because they are very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page or e-mail message.

Depending upon your device or computer, you may be able to set your browser(s) to reject cookies or delete cookies, but that may result in the loss of some functionality on our websites. If we combine or link cookie or Web beacon information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined or linked information as Personal Information under this Policy.

  * **Web Browsing Activity**

_T-Mobile Websites._ When accessing T-Mobile websites, mobile websites and related applications and widgets designed for your device or web-based experience, we automatically collect certain information about your device and your visit, such as your IP address, browser type, date and time, the Web page you visited before visiting our website, your activities and purchases on our websites, and other analytical information associated with the sites.

_Non-T-Mobile Websites._ When your device’s Web browser utilizes our data services to access non-T-Mobile websites, we automatically capture information associated with your browsing activities, and measure and monitor network and Internet connection performance, throughput, latency, and similar network data.

  * **Voice Controlled Applications**

If you use a voice-controlled application, that application may collect and record your requests and other information from you and your phone.

  




**Information From Other Sources**

We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, with your consent we may receive credit information from third-party sources before initiating your service, or background information in connection with employment opportunities. We may also obtain updated address information from our shippers or other vendors. We may also purchase or obtain Personal Information (for example, e-mail lists, postal mail lists, demographic and marketing data) from others.

We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes, such as:

  * To route your calls or message or otherwise provide you with service;
  * To provide and bill for products and services you purchase and charge to your T-Mobile account;
  * To deliver and confirm products and services you obtain from us;
  * To verify your identity and maintain a record of your transactions and interactions with us;
  * To provide customer and technical services to you;
  * To create, modify, improve, enhance, remove or fix our network, products and services, and their performance;
  * To identify and suggest products or services that might interest you;
  * To make internal business decisions about current and future product and service offerings;
  * To provide you customized user experiences, including personalized product and service offerings;
  * To protect our rights, interests, safety and property and that of our customers, service providers and other third parties; and
  * To comply with law or as required for legal purposes.



**Employment**

If you submit a job application or résumé, we use the information we collect during the application process to communicate with you and, subject to applicable law, evaluate your qualifications for employment.

**Fraud Prevention**

We may use Personal Information, including voice print recordings, account information (such as purchase patterns) and device information for fraud investigations or prevention.

**Information Collected from Cookies**

We may also use information collected from cookies or other similar technologies to improve our websites, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request.

**Marketing**

We may use information we collect to contact you about T-Mobile or third-party products, services, and offers that we believe you may find of interest. We may contact you by telephone, postal mail, e-mail, or other methods. You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time as outlined below in Choices Regarding Use of Your Information.

**Directories**

We do not publish directories of our customers’ wireless numbers; nor will we provide or make such numbers available to third-parties for listing in their public directories, without the customer’s prior consent.

**Performance, Diagnostics & Management**

Information collected by T-Mobile from devices, our network and WiFi usage permits T-Mobile to perform diagnostic analyses and understand how your device is performing overall. Diagnostic data helps T-Mobile troubleshoot technical issues related to your device’s performance such as battery life, dropped calls, processing speed, device memory, service coverage, and network and WiFi signal strength that you and other customers may experience. If you are using a device in WiFi mode, we may collect information about that usage, such as the routing address and IP address. T-Mobile also may use diagnostic data to identify and recommend products and services.

**Location-Based Services**

We use location information to route wireless communications and to provide 911 service, which allows emergency services to locate you or your device. We may disclose, without your consent, the approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical harm.

Depending on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array of services based on the location of your device (for example, driving directions, enhanced 411 Directory Assistance, find my device or search results, etc.). These data services, known as Location-Based Services (“LBS”) are made available by T-Mobile and other entities, usually via applications. These services use various location technologies and acquire location data from various sources.

These applications and services use various location technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite (“GPS”), Assisted GPS (“AGPS”), cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate location of a device, which is often then used in conjunction with the application to enhance the user’s experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance or search results, etc.)

LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on T-Mobile’s network, and location-based services may or may not look to T-Mobile’s network to obtain location data. Where T-Mobile allows third parties the capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from the T-Mobile network, we require those third parties to observe specific privacy and security protections consistent with this policy.

It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the terms under which these services are provided – whether by T-Mobile or another entity.

You should carefully review the privacy policies and other terms of third-parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing your location information to other people.

Where T-Mobile itself provides a location-based service, you will receive notice of the location features of the service and collection of location data is with your consent. You will be provided options for managing when and how LBS information should be shared (except in the case of certain parental controls or similar services associated with enterprise or multi-line accounts – for example, T-Mobile’s FamilyWhereTM services – which may be managed solely by the primary account holder or their designee, but always with notice to the end-user). T-Mobile follows the CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available [here](http://www.ctia.org/business_resources/wic/index.cfm/AID/11300).

For more information on location services, see [Privacy Resources/Location Services](https://web.archive.org/Company/PrivacyResources.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_LocationServices)

**Advertising**

You may see advertisements when you visit our websites, mobile websites, mobile applications, or on your device. T-Mobile may help advertisers better reach T-Mobile customers by providing certain information, including device type, geographic information, language preferences or demographic information obtained from other companies to allow advertisers to determine which ads may be more relevant to you. However, we do not share Personal Information outside of T-Mobile without your consent.

Some examples of the types of advertising you might see include:

_T-Mobile Ads on T-Mobile Websites._ T-Mobile may provide advertisements, such as banner ads, on our Websites, mobile websites, and in mobile applications and widgets you may download, access or use on your device.

_Other Company Ads on T-Mobile Websites._ You may also see third-party advertisements on some T-Mobile Websites, services, or applications, or devices. These third-party advertisers, or their ad networks, may place or access cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your device, or use your device identifier, and may collect certain anonymous or de-identified information about your visit on our websites. The third-party advertisers who provide these ads may use this information to provide you with advertising on our websites, as well as on other websites. T-Mobile does not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer or device by ad servers, ad networks, or third-party advertisers.

_T-Mobile Ads on Non-T-Mobile Websites._ We may ask third-parties to place advertisements about our products and services on other websites. The use of cookies, Web beacons, or similar technologies by such third-parties on other websites is subject to any applicable privacy policies that they may have, not this Policy.

_Other Company Ads on Non-T-Mobile Websites._ We may share de-identified information with third parties so that they may use it to tailor ads to your interests.

**Interest-Based Ads.** You may receive ads from T-Mobile and its ad providers that are tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads are selected based on your use of T-Mobile services and products as well as other information obtained by us and our ad providers. None of this information is Personal Information.

  * T-Mobile does not provide your Personal Information to third-party advertisers without your consent.
  * Advertising may be tailored to the interests that advertisers have inferred from your browsing of our Websites or other Websites with which the third-party is affiliated as an ad server or ad network.   

  * We may provide third-party advertisers with aggregated or anonymous, de-identified, demographic or similar data (unrelated to your browsing activities) that does not personally identify you. This data may be used by advertisers to help tailor their ads on our Websites, and on other sites.
  * T-Mobile and our providers may use an anonymous profile of your Web-browsing activity and interests. This profile does not contain information that identifies you personally, but may include a unique or encrypted identifier that enables your device to be matched to a profile of your browsing activity and anonymous characteristics about your interests.
  * When we use information associated with your web browsing activities on nonT-Mobile websites to provide interest-based advertising or offers of T-Mobile or third-party products or services, we will provide you with notice and appropriate choice.



Choices about Advertising.

  


  * On Your Mobile Device. Where we offer interest based ads, you can opt-out of certain interest-based advertising by clicking on the ad options link on or near the advertisement or by clicking [here](http://iba.t-mobile.com/tmo/). 
    * If you turn off interest-based ads, you will still see just as many ads, but the ads may not be based on your interests and may be less relevant to you.
    * Your choice only affects the ads you see on websites you access on your device.
    * If your device’s browser cookies are deleted, or your device is reset, you may need to reset the interest-based ads feature.
    * If you are using your device, but are not on the T-Mobile network (such as a WiFi network), T-Mobile and our ad providers may not be able to identify your ad choices.
  * On Your Computer or Non-Mobile Device. Third-party advertisers or ad networks operating on our Websites are required to participate in the opt-out process established by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). To learn more, or to opt-out of the automatic collection of information by these parties, please visit the [NAI site](http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of ads on our websites, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to content on a Web page or in an application or based on other nonpersonal information. Please note that this opt-out is cookie-based. If you change computers or devices, change Web browsers, or delete cookies, you will need to visit the NAI site and opt-out again.



We do not sell, license, rent, or otherwise provide your Personal Information to unaffiliated third-parties (parties outside the T-Mobile corporate family) to market their services or products to you without your consent. We may, however, disclose your information to unaffiliated third-parties as follows:

**With Your Consent**

We may disclose Personal Information about you to third-parties with your consent. We may obtain your consent in writing; online, through "click-through" agreements; or other manifestations of assent; when you accept the terms of disclosures on your phone for certain applications or services; orally, in our stores or on the phone, including through interactive voice response, or implicitly, for example, when you purchase a product and ask that it be shipped to your home, consenting to our disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping company to complete delivery.

**To the Primary Account Holder**

We may disclose information about an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide information about you or your use of the service, products or devices to them or others at their direction.

When you are the primary account holder, but you receive special or discounted pricing, terms, or other benefits through another party’s agreement with us (for example, an employee discount), we may provide enough information to that party to verify your initial and continuing eligibility for benefits under their agreement with us and to calculate any associated discounts.

**To Our Service Providers**

We may disclose information to third-party vendors and partners who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf (for example, credit/debit card processing, billing, shipping, repair, customer service, auditing, and marketing). These third parties are permitted to use the information only for the purpose provided to them and only in a manner consistent with this Policy.

**Third-Party Carriers and Suppliers**

If you are roaming on the network of another carrier, your wireless telephone number, your location, the numbers you dial, and other information about your usage will be available to that carrier to facilitate that service. Additionally, services and functionality offered through certain devices are sometimes provided in conjunction with entities other than T-Mobile. As a result, Personal Information from your devices may be uploaded and stored on their servers. For instance, BlackBerry® service is provided in conjunction with Research in Motion (RIM), and Personal Information from your device is stored on their BlackBerry Enterprise ServersTM. Their specific terms and conditions, terms of use, and privacy polices apply to those services.

**In a Business Transfer**

We may disclose information about you as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint venture, corporate reorganization, financing, or sale of company assets, or in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which such information could be transferred to third-parties as a business asset in the transaction.

**For Legal Process & Protection of T-Mobile and Others**

We may disclose Personal Information, and information about you, or your communications, where we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary:

  


  * To satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;
  * To enforce or apply agreements, or initiate, render, bill, and collect for services and products (including to collection agencies in order to obtain payment for T-Mobile products and services);
  * To protect our rights or interests, property or safety or that of others;
  * In connection with claims, disputes, or litigation – in court or elsewhere;
  * To protect users of our services and other carriers or providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services;
  * To facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government; or
  * In an emergency situation.



**Co-Sponsored Websites and Partners**

If you provide information to us in connection with a co-sponsored Website, this Policy will apply to our use of the information and the co-sponsor’s policy will apply to their use of the information. If you purchase equipment or activate service at one of our partner’s locations, they may request information from you that is passed to T-Mobile as part of the activation process, but which may also be retained by the partner. This Policy will govern T-Mobile’s use of such information, and the partner’s privacy policy will govern its use of such information.

**De-Identified Information**

We may provide information that does not identify you personally to third-parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes.

**Third-Party Applications for Your Devices**

T-Mobile is not responsible for the third-party applications (for example, applications, programs, widgets, etc.) you select and install on your device. When you install third party applications, you may give your consent for the third party to access information stored on the device and on T-Mobile’s network to facilitate the application’s functions (for example, you may consent to third-party access to your location information – see Location Based Services). The manner in which such third-parties may use, share, or disclose such information is governed by the terms and conditions and privacy policy provided by that third party – not by this Policy. For more information, see Privacy Resources/Device Apps

**Protecting Your Information**

We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure while it is under our control. For instance, when you provide sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) to our websites, we use transmission encryption technologies like Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Of course, no one can guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of information will never occur, but we strive to prevent such occurrences.

We provide password protected online access to your account information through my.t-mobile.com. For multi-line accounts, the primary account holder is authorized to access online account information for all the devices and lines on the account. Other users may generally access online account information related only to their respective device and line (for example, if a parent provides a device to their child, the child may access online information about that device and line– including CPNI). The primary account holder, however, may designate additional or more limited access rights for other users on the account.

Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with those rules. We will not intentionally disclose your CPNI to third-parties without your permission, except as allowed under FCC rules, applicable law, or explained in this Policy. However, if you are the primary account holder, you may designate other “authorized users” (for example, a spouse) to access and manage your account information, including CPNI. For more information see [Privacy Resources/Customer Proprietary Network](https://web.archive.org/Company/PrivacyResources.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_CPNI) Information

**Employee Access**

Our practices and procedures are designed to limit information access to those T-Mobile employees and agents with a legitimate need for access. T-Mobile employees are bound by confidentiality obligations and our Code of Conduct, which obligate them to protect the confidentiality of our customers’ information. Violations subject employees to disciplinary action, which can include termination.

**Retention and Disposal**

We retain information only for as long as we have a business or tax need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require. When we dispose of Personal Information, we use reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).

**Vendors**

We require our third-party vendors to comply with strict requirements around security, retention, use and destruction of any personal information we provide to them or that they collect on our behalf.

**Breach**

We will make attempts to notify you if we determine that a security breach involving your Personal Information has occurred and creates a risk of identity theft or service disruption, or as otherwise required by law.

**Access to Your Information**

You may access and modify your contact information by visiting my.t-mobile.com or a T-Mobile retail store, or by contacting Customer Service. You may also contact us using the information in the “How to Contact Us” section below.

**Choices Regarding Use of Your Information**

A T-Mobile marketing communication is when we contact you directly about offers for service or products we sell using your Personal Information. We want to provide you with meaningful choices regarding our marketing communications and you may choose to limit or opt-out of some marketing communications from T-Mobile at any time. Although you may elect not to receive marketing information from us, if you subscribe to our services or buy our products, you will continue to receive invoices, customer-service and transactional notices, and similar communications. The Primary Account Holder can configure options for marketing communications for all lines on the account.

If you are a T-Mobile customer and you manage your account online, you can manage your preferences regarding marketing communications by logging into your [my.t-mobile.com](https://my.t-mobile.com/) profile. If you do not manage your account online, or you are not a current T-Mobile customer, you may manage your preferences regarding marketing communications [here](https://web.archive.org/company/website/OptOut.aspx?type=2).

You may also manage your preferences regarding marketing communications by contacting Customer Service by dialing 611 from your T-Mobile phone or 1-800-937-8997 from any phone, or, with respect to marketing e-mails, by following the “unsubscribe” instructions on any marketing e-mail we send you.

See also Privacy Resources/Marketing Choice

Marketing communications, which may use your Personal Information, are not the same as advertisements, which do not use your Personal Information. You may still receive advertising on your device through your use of Web services and applications or when visiting T-Mobile websites, mobile websites or related applications or widgets.

We work hard to reduce unsolicited advertising, spam, and SMShing, but we cannot block all such advertisements or unwanted communications. Not all marketing communications you receive on your device are sent or authorized by T-Mobile. When you provide your contact information to others, or even based on random contacts, you may receive unwanted calls, text messages, or e-mails on your device.

**Not Call Registry**

The FTC maintains a National Do Not Call Registry at <https://www.donotcall.gov/>, and your state may maintain its own Do Not Call Registry. Putting your number on these Registries also may limit our telemarketing calls to that number.

**Protecting Your Personal Information**

You play an important role in ensuring the security of Personal Information. We encourage you to use safeguards to protect your information and devices. For more information please see [Privacy Resources/Protecting Your Privacy](https://web.archive.org/Company/PrivacyResources.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_Resources) .

**Consumer Code for Wireless Service**

We follow the Consumer Code for Wireless Service established by the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (“CTIA”). In doing so, we want to help customers understand their bills, receive quality service, and make informed choices and conform our information practices under this Policy to meet the requirements of applicable federal and state laws and regulations.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

California Civil Code Section 1798 entitles California customers to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. As stated in this Policy, T-Mobile will not sell or share your Personal Information with non-T-Mobile companies for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. California customers who wish to request further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices and policies may contact us as specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.

**Other Governing Terms**

This Policy does not modify or alter any applicable agreement you have with T-Mobile. For example, our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/company/website/termsofuse.aspx) govern your use of our websites. Additionally, if you use our products or use or subscribe to our services, our T-Mobile [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Templates/Popup.aspx?PAsset=Ftr_Ftr_TermsAndConditions&print=true), one or more applicable service agreements, and certain other terms may apply to your use, purchase, or subscription. If this Policy conflicts with any portion of those terms and agreements, those terms and agreements govern to the extent of the inconsistency.

**How We Communicate Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Policy to provide clarification of our practices. If we make changes, we will revise the date at the top of the Policy. If we propose to use Personal Information in a materially different way, we will provide you with notice by posting notice of the changes on our Website for at least 30 days before we implement those changes, and obtain your consent as noted above for any material change regarding disclosure of Personal Information. You should refer to this Policy often for the latest information and the effective date of any changes.

**How to Contact Us**

If you have any questions or comments about this Policy or about T-Mobile's privacy practices, please call Customer Service at 611 (from a T-Mobile phone) or 1-800-937-8997 (from any phone) or send an e-mail message to [privacy@t-mobile.com.](mailto:privacy@t-mobile.com) You may also direct your privacy-related comments or questions to the address below:
