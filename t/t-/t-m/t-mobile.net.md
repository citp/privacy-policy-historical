## 8\. Will my usage habits be evaluated, e.g. for advertising purposes, tracking or fraud prevention?

 **Explanations and definitions**

We want you to enjoy using our websites and take advantage of our products and services. We have an economic interest in ensuring this is the case. We analyze your usage habits on the basis of anonymized or pseudonymized data so you can find the products that interest you and so we can make our websites user-friendly. We or companies commissioned by us to process data create usage profiles to the extent permitted by law. This information cannot be traced back to you directly. Subsequently we inform you generally about the various purposes and techniques. Afterwards you have the right to revoke your consent. However, please remember that in this case you may not have access to the full range of functions offered by our websites.  

 **a) Purposes (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR / §15 (3) German Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz – TMG)  **

  *  **Tag management**  
Tag management is used to manage tracking tools in websites. A tag is set for each page to do this. Based on the tag, the system can determine which tracking tools should be used for this page. Tag management can be used to specifically control tracking so that the tools are only used where appropriate.
  *  **Market research / Reach measurement**  
Reach measurement provides statistics on a website’s usage intensity and the number of users, along with comparable figures for all the connected services. Individual users are not identified at any time. Your identity is always protected.



 **b) Techniques**

 **Cookies**  
We use cookies for certain services. These are small text files that are stored on your computer. They enable the system to tell if you repeatedly visit websites from the same computer.

 **Session cookies** are cookies which are only stored on your computer for the duration of your Internet session and are required for transactions (e.g. to log in or to complete a purchase). They simply contain a transaction ID.

For certain services, we use persistent cookies, which are stored on your computer for future sessions. In this case, we notify you about the cookie’s storage period. 

You can set your browser to prevent these cookies being stored or to delete the cookies at the end of your Internet session. However, please remember that in this case you may not have access to the full range of functions offered by our websites. For information about browser settings go to: <https://www.sicherdigital.de/sicher-surfen#sicher-surfen-browsereinstellungen>

**Measurement pixels**  
Measurement pixels are simply images measuring 1×1 pixels. They are transparent or are the same color as the background, making them invisible. If a website is opened that contains a measurement pixel, this small image is then downloaded from the provider’s server on the Internet and the download is recorded on the server. This way the process provider can see when and how many users requested this measurement pixel or visited a website. The provider can also see whether JavaScript is enabled or not in the browser. If JavaScript is enabled, additional information such as browser information, operating system, screen resolution can be recorded.

This function is normally executed by calling JavaScript; nonetheless the term measurement pixel is still used.

 **JavaScript**  
JavaScripts are used to call the application and to transfer the collected parameters to the particular service provider/measurement pixel provider.
