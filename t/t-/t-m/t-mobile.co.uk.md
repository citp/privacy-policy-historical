# Privacy Policy - T-Mobile

Skip to navigation

We share information with members of the Deutsche Telekom group and the France Telecom group (our parent companies) and other companies with which we have a business relationship. If we have to send your details to countries without proper data protection laws, we remain responsible for keeping this information secure. 

We do not pass information about your telephone contract to companies who contact you to offer to renew it or upgrade it.

As you use your T-Mobile service, we hold your account information. Some records are kept for statistical purposes. This helps us understand and serve our customers better and improve our network. Data relating to the routing, timing or duration of a communication may be kept for up to a year. To ensure security for you and our staff, and help to maintain service quality, some calls to our Customer Service centres are monitored. Your personal details are not held indefinitely, but are destroyed after a period of time. Some information will be held after you have closed your account with us.

In various areas of this website we ask you for information.

When you place a sales order with us we need to know your name, email address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date. This lets us process your order. 

We may offer to send you newsletters or information updates by email. Or we might ask you if you want to enter a competition or promotion. For this we'll ask for an email address. 

We may ask you for information about yourself and your phone use to help you decide which of our products and services would suit you best. 

You may want to check that your home or office is covered by the T-Mobile network. To do this we ask you for your postcode. 

Access to your Information  
If you want, you can always access your personal information. Just make a written request clearly identifying yourself and the information you require. We'll charge you £10 to cover the cost of supplying it. If we hold any inaccurate information about you we will correct it.

Our address is:  
T-Mobile, Hatfield Business Park, Hertfordshire, AL10 9BW.
