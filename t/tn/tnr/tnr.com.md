# Privacy Policy | New Republic

This Privacy Policy was last updated effective October 13, 2014.

To help you understand how information submitted will be treated when you log on to and use our web site, The New Republic Online (“NewRepublic.com”) offers this Privacy Policy. Use of the NewRepublic.com web site, and disclosure to us of your personal information, is optional and voluntary. By visiting [NewRepublic.com](https://newrepublic.com/), you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Policy. The following paragraphs describe the type of information NewRepublic.com collects, the reasons why such information is collected, how such information is used and who has access to it.

### General Principles

NewRepublic.com's Privacy Policy may change from time to time without notice to you. You should read this Privacy Policy each time you plan to submit personally identifiable information so that you understand how the information you are submitting will be used.

Any changes made to the Privacy Policy will be prospective, not retroactive.

NewRepublic.com is not responsible for the information practices of third parties, although we take care to engage third party fulfillment processors, ad servers, survey companies and other support services that respect your privacy, preferences and data security needs.

### Collection of Information

NewRepublic.com collects information that is provided voluntarily by visitors to our site. Certain identifying information, such as name, street address, city, state, zip code and email address, is gathered at certain interactive areas on the site, such as when you subscribe to our print or digital publication while online.

Wherever possible and practical, NewRepublic.com gives users options about submitting information. Such choices include:

Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters.

Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviate the need for collecting information from our users.

### Subscriptions

You may use the web site to subscribe to the print or digital version of The New Republic by following the instructions for subscribing. All subscription-related information is collected from users on this site and stored by the magazine's fulfillment house, CDS Global.

### Electronic Newsletters

NewRepublic.com offers several electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe and unsubscribe at any time. NewRepublic.com uses Mailchimp, a reputable third party, to deliver the email newsletters you will receive from our site and serve all of the advertisements that are placed within those emails.

Mailchimp collects and stores all the information users submit to NewRepublic.com in connection with the electronic newsletters. If you would like to know more about the information-gathering practices and “opt-out” procedures of Mailchimp, please see http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/

You may remove yourself from any or all of the electronic newsletters' mailing lists at any time by following instructions for unsubscribing found at the end of every newsletter or by emailing [support@tnr.com](mailto:support@tnr.com).

### Surveys

From time to time NewRepublic com conducts voluntary user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers for various purposes including promotions, contests and offers. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party, unless so indicated in this Privacy Policy.

### Cookies and IP Addresses

In order to offer and provide personalized custom services, NewRepublic com uses cookies to limit the number of times a particular advertisement is shown to a user as the user navigates through the site. A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file may contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited and to allow easy access to restricted areas of the web site. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk, read cookie files created by other sites, or damage your files.

If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You also may refuse cookies by disabling them on your browser. You do need to have cookies turned on to use premium areas of NewRepublic.com.

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. NewRepublic com may use data contained in log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

We also use third party advertisements on NewRepublic com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

### Use of the Information Collected

NewRepublic.com uses information you voluntarily submit to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to move seamlessly through our web site and to communicate with users with legal notices, notices of material changes to terms and conditions, privacy policy, rules, etc., and account status. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (weekly) and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. With respect to advertisements, an advertiser will inform us which type of audience it seeks to reach, and tnr.com, through Mailchimp, will place the advertisement in the body of the email newsletter of those individuals fitting the advertiser's criteria. Pop-up advertisements may be displayed to a targeted audience based on the same criteria. The advertisers are not able to access your account or any of your personally identifiable information.

We also use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and do not like based on traffic to those areas.

NewRepublic.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests. Because NewRepublic.com does not track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked on a particular ad.

### Credit Card Information

We comply with generally accepted industry standards in collecting and processing credit card information. However, NewRepublic.com does not guarantee the safety of credit card information over the Internet.

### Information Sharing

When you visit NewRepublic com and are asked to provide information about yourself, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, you are sharing that information only with NewRepublic com. NewRepublic com will not disclose the information you submit, except with our third party fulfillment vendors and except as otherwise described here, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure to protect the rights or property of NewRepublic com, or for administrative or other purposes we deem necessary to maintain or service our products and services. For example, we may allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with our services.

If you do not want your data to be shared, you may choose not to permit the data to be collected or transferred by not submitting personally identifiable information on our site, or by not using a particular service.

### NewRepublic.com Security Measures

The NewRepublic.com web site has technical and organizational security measures in place, including firewalls, to protect the information under our control from accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures do not guarantee prevention of loss, misuse, or alteration of information, however, so while we strive to protect your information, NewRepublic com cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

### Children's Privacy

NewRepublic.com site is intended for use by individuals over the age of 18. We will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and not knowingly provide children under the age of 13 with access to NewRepublic com. If you are under 13, please do not submit any personally identifiable information on our site. Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission to send any personal information online to anyone.

### Other Information About Your Privacy

Whenever you voluntarily disclose any information online in any forum, that information can be collected and used by others. In other words, if you post personal information online that may be accessed by the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. It is important to be responsible and careful whenever you are online.

### Updating, Correcting and Deleting Personal Information

Users who subscribe to our print or digital publication, The New Republic, may correct or change online their subscription information. Users may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems with updating information, or who have any questions about how our services work, may contact us at [support@tnr.com](mailto:support@tnr.com).

If you do not want your personally identifiable information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by letting us know by e-mailing, calling, or writing us (see addresses below). Similarly, please contact us at the same addresses if at any time you wish to review your personally identifiable information.

Currently, NewRepublic.com does not offer users a means by which to completely delete personal information submitted while on this site.

### Additional Information

If, for any reason, you believe that NewRepublic.com has not adhered to its Privacy Policy, please notify us by sending an email message to support@tnr.com. NewRepublic com will try to respond to your concerns and, where appropriate, attempt to correct the problem.

By using this web site, you signify your assent to this policy statement regarding online privacy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our web site. Moreover, your continued use of this web site after we post changes to the Privacy Policy will mean that you accept those changes.
