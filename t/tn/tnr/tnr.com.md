# The New Republic Online: Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

To help you understand how information submitted will be treated when you log on to and use our web site, _The New Republic Online_ ("TheNewRepublic.com") offers this Privacy Policy. Use of TheNewRepublic.com web site, and disclosure to us of your personal information, is optional and voluntary. By visiting TheNewRepublic.com, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Policy. 

The following paragraphs describe the type of information TheNewRepublic.com collects, the reasons why such information is collected, how such information is used and who has access to it. 

**General Principles**

TheNewRepublic.com will not release your personal data to anyone else without your consent. 

TheNewRepublic.com's Privacy Policy may change from time to time without notice to you. You should read this Privacy Policy each time you plan to submit personal information so that you understand how the information you are submitting will be used. 

Any changes made to the Privacy Policy will be prospective, not retroactive. 

TheNewRepublic.com is not responsible for the information practices of third parties. 

**Collection of Information**

TheNewRepublic.com collects information in various ways that is volunteered by visitors to our site. Certain identifying information, such as name, street address, city, state, zip code and email address, is gathered at certain interactive areas on the site, such as when you subscribe to our print publication while online. 

Wherever possible and practical, TheNewRepublic.com gives users options about submitting information. Such choices include: 

Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters. 

Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need for collecting information from our users. 

**Subscriptions**

You may use the web site to subscribe to the print version of _The New Republic_ by following the instructions for subscribing. All subscription-related information is collected from users on this site and stored by the magazine's fulfillment house, Communications Data Services, Inc. ("CDS"), a reputable third party. 

**Electronic Newsletters**

TheNewRepublic.com offers several electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe and unsubscribe at any time. TheNewRepublic.com uses DoubleClick®, a reputable third party, to deliver the email newsletters you will receive from our site and serve all of the advertisements that are placed within those emails. DoubleClick® provides this email service through its DARTmail™ service. 

DoubleClick® collects and stores all the information users submit to TheNewRepublic.com in connection with the electronic newsletters. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures of DoubleClick®, please go to [Doubleclick's website](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/). 

You may remove yourself from any or all of the electronic newsletters' mailing lists at any time by following the instructions for unsubscribing found at the end of every newsletter. 

**Letters to the Editor**

You may submit letters to the editor by sending your letters via email. Any letters you send to TheNewRepublic.com or _The New Republic_ , whether online or in hard copy, become the sole property of TheNewRepublic.com for all purposes in any media, may be modified by us in any way, and will not be returned to you. 

**Surveys**

From time to time TheNewRepublic.com conducts voluntary user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party, unless so indicated in this Privacy Policy. 

**Cookies and IP Addresses**

In order to offer and provide personalized custom services, TheNewRepublic.com uses cookies to limit the number of times a particular advertisement is shown to a user as the user navigates through the site. A cookie is a small data file that certain web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file may contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited and to allow easy access to restricted areas of the web site. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk, read cookie files created by other sites, or damage your files. 

If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You also may refuse cookies by disabling them on your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use TheNewRepublic.com. 

IP addresses are also recorded in the log files on TheNewRepublic.com. TheNewRepublic.com may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

**Use of the Information Collected**

TheNewRepublic.com uses any information you voluntarily give to enhance your experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site, to present content more effectively, or to make our future marketing efforts more efficient. 

TheNewRepublic.com uses information you voluntarily submit to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to move seamlessly through our web site. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (weekly) and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. With respect to advertisements, an advertiser will inform us which type of audience it seeks to reach, and TheNewRepublic.com, through DoubleClick®, will place the advertisement in the body of the email newsletter of those individuals fitting the advertiser's criteria. Pop-up advertisements are displayed to a targeted audience based on the same criteria. The advertisers are not able to access your account or any of your personally identifiable information. 

We also use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and do not like based on traffic to those areas. 

TheNewRepublic.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests. Because TheNewRepublic.com does not track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked on a particular ad. 

**Information Sharing**

When you visit TheNewRepublic.com and are asked to provide information about yourself, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, you are sharing that information only with TheNewRepublic.com. TheNewRepublic.com will not disclose the information you submit, except as described here, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure to protect the rights or property of TheNewRepublic.com, or for administrative or other purposes we deem necessary to maintain or service our products and services. For example, we may allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with our services. 

As discussed above, TheNewRepublic.com uses DoubleClick® to collect and store personal information users submit when subscribing to the electronic newsletters. CDS stores information collected from you when you subscribe online to our print publication, _The New Republic_. These third parties may have their own privacy and data collection practices. TheNewRepublic.com has no responsibility or liability for these third party policies. 

If you do not want your data to be shared, you may choose not to permit the data to be collected or transferred by not submitting personally identifiable information on our site, or by not using a particular service. 

**TheNewRepublic.com Security Measures**

TheNewRepublic.com web site has technical and organizational security measures in place, including firewalls, to protect the information under our control from accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures do not guarantee prevention of loss, misuse, or alteration of information, however, so while we strive to protect your information, TheNewRepublic.com cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

**Children's Privacy**

TheNewRepublic.com site is intended for use by individuals over the age of 16, and not for children. If you are under 16, please do not submit any personally identifiable information on our site. Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission to send any personal information online to anyone. 

**Other Information About Your Privacy**

Whenever you voluntarily disclose any information online in any forum, that information can be collected and used by others. In other words, if you post personal information online that may be accessed by the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. It is important to be responsible and careful whenever you are online. 

**Updating, Correcting and Deleting Personal Information**

Users who subscribe to our print publication, _The New Republic_ , may correct or change online their subscription information. Users may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems with updating information, or who have any questions about how our services work, may contact us at [online@tnr.com](mailto:online@tnr.com). 

Currently, TheNewRepublic.com does not offer users a means by which to completely delete personal information submitted while on this site.
