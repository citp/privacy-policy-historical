                                          In the Careers section of our site, we have retained a third party company, OpenHire, to manage resumes submitted for North American employment opportunities. OpenHire hosts the resume submission form even though it appears that users are still on the TNS site. If you submit your resume using the form on the TNS North America Career Opportunity site, only a limited number of TNS staff will have access to it. OpenHire is contractually bound to keep your information confidential and is not allowed to use it for its own promotional purposes.
