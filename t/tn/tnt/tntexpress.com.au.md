**Personal Information  
**  
Examples of customer information that we collect include names, information on your shipment, addresses, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers. Some of the information collected by TNT is data which relates to an identifiable person ("Personal Information").

**Collection of Personal Information and purpose thereof** TNT collects and stores information about every package it handles in order to enable efficient provision of package delivery services demanded by its customers. TNT uses information about its customers, their packages, and their shipping activity to provide or enhance the services it makes available to its customers, communicate with its customers about additional services they may find of value, satisfy our legitimate business interests (including performing trend analysis and market studies), set prices, establish credit, accomplish the billing function, and comply with government regulations applicable to us or our subsidiaries.

Any Personal Information which we collect will be used solely for the purpose of providing our services, and we will not store it for any longer period than is legally permissible and required for this purpose.

**Third Parties  
**  
As we collect and use information about our customers, we may contract with vendors to assist us in processing that information for those purposes listed in the previous paragraph. In addition, we may ask our subsidiaries to process information, for those purposes, on our behalf. These vendors and/or subsidiaries are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are restricted from using the information for any other purpose. In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell subsidiaries or business units. As part of these transactions, customer information of the subsidiaries or business units may be one of the transferred assets.

We will monitor on an ongoing basis compliance with the provisions of the applicable local legislation and regulations by third party processors, such as suppliers and contractors, of Personal Information held by us.  
**  
Fair and Secure Processing of Your Personal Information** It is our policy to take all necessary steps to ensure that all your Personal Information held by us is processed fairly and lawfully. We will take all necessary steps to implement and maintain this Privacy Policy. All our employees and data processors that have access to Personal Information are obliged to respect the confidentiality of your Personal Information.

**Transfer of Personal Information** Your Personal Information may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area, which do not provide an adequate level of protection, in order to perform our services. In addition, if you put your Personal Information on publicly available parts of the website, this may be accessed by persons in countries outside the European Economic Area, which may not offer an adequate level of protection.

TNT may need to transfer your information to local or national (foreign) governments, in order to comply with the applicable law or in order to expedite the delivery of your package to its destination.

**Access and correction** You can find out which of your Personal Information is held by TNT by contacting your local TNT office. We will acknowledge your request within 4 weeks. Should we be prevented from disclosing your personal information we will give reasons for any such refusal.

To keep your Personal Information accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as about any incorrect information. We will update or correct Personal Information in our possession.

**TNT websites** The following paragraphs describe our commitment to the protection of Personal Information as it applies to the TNT websites.

We may disclose your Personal Information where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.

**Collection of Personal Information on TNT websites** Users can visit most areas of this website without revealing who they are or without providing any information about themselves. However, some of our interactive services require that users identify themselves in order to enable the interactive function. On this website TNT may ask users to provide Personal Information. We may share such information with our subsidiaries.

_Active collection of Personal Information and purpose thereof_ During your visit of this website, TNT actively collects information from its visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail. Some of the information that you submit may be Personal Information.

Some areas of this website may require you to submit Personal Information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as e-mail alerts or newsletter subscriptions). You will be informed at each information collection point which information is required and for which purpose.

_Passive collection of Personal Information and purpose thereof_ As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies (see next paragraph), Internet tags and navigational data collection.

This website uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site.

**Cookies** Cookies are small text files that a website can send to a user's browser for storage on the hard drive. Cookies can make use of the web easier by saving and administering status, application, preferences and other user information. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies but users can change the setting to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent.

When you view this website, TNT may store some information on your computer. This will be in the form of a cookie file. We use cookies to store information which we may use to improve the content of our site and to customise the site to your preferences.

The cookie can only be accessed by [www.tnt.com](http://www.tnt.com/).

We consider your browser settings to reflect your consent to, or refusal of, the cookies we use on our website. If you prefer not to accept cookies or if you prefer to be warned when one is being used, you can update the settings of your Internet browser. If you or your site administrator have cookies disabled, the website will continue to work; however, no parts of the website (inclusive of shipping tools, tracking and tracing of packages) will not work if cookies are disabled.

We also use third-party services (such as Google Analytics) to collect aggregate information about the visitors to our website. These third-party services use cookies to provide us with non-personally identifiable information about your visit to this website (e.g. the number visits, location from which you visited this website and the number of pages you visited on this website). We use this information to improve the presentation and content of this website.
