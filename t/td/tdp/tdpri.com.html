<h2>Personal Information</h2>
	<p>GearTalk Network asks for personal information only when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). For example, GearTalk Network asks for your name, email address, and location when you register, and collects additional information for surveys or other promotions sponsored by GearTalk Network and/or its promotional partners. We use your Personal Information to operate GearTalk Network's services, and to help identify you and gather broad demographic information. </p>
    
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>GearTalk Network or its advertisers may place a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information or files that are stored on a user's computer by the Web server through a user's browser for record keeping purposes. The information can be retrieved to personalize, monitor, or regulate use of the site. Cookies allow GearTalk Network to automate access and data entry functions of the site, such as login information, and tailor the site to a user's preferences or interests. In addition, cookies allow GearTalk Network to track usage of the site to determine those areas of the site that are useful or popular (and those that are not), thereby enabling GearTalk Network to improve and update its service. </p>

<p>GearTalk Network may send you information about various products and services that may be of interest to you. When you register for membership on any of our WEBSITES you grant the COMPANY permission to send these communications to you. You may opt-out of some of these communications.

<h2>Public Forums</h2>
<p>GearTalk Network offers User provided content. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose Personal Information to other users or third parties on the GearTalk Network WEBSITES, or through email, or outside of the GearTalk Network system, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other members or parties.
