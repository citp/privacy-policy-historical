# TDPRI.COM Privacy Policy

Because protecting your privacy is very important to TDPRI.COM, we have established this Privacy Policy, which explains what information we collect from our visitors, how we use that information, and how you can view or control use of the information you submit. Please note that this policy may be revised from time to time, so please check it frequently. We will post notice of any changes to this policy. 

Personal Information.

TDPRI.COM asks for personal information only when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). For example, TDPRI.COM asks for your name, email address, and location when you register, and collects additional information for surveys or other promotions sponsored by TDPRI.COM and/or its promotional partners. We use your Personal Information to operate TDPRI.COM's services, and to help identify you and gather broad demographic information.   


## Cookies.

TDPRI.COM or its advertisers may place a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. Cookies are small pieces of information or files that are stored on a user's computer by the Web server through a user's browser for record keeping purposes. The information can be retrieved to personalize, monitor, or regulate use of the site. Cookies allow TDPRI.COM to automate access and data entry functions of the site, such as login information, and tailor the site to a user's preferences or interests. In addition, cookies allow TDPRI.COM to track usage of the site to determine those areas of the site that are useful or popular (and those that are not), thereby enabling TDPRI.COM to improve and update its service. 

## Direct Mailings and "Opting In".

TDPRI.COM may send you information about various products and services that may be of interest to you if you specifically request this information on an "opt in" basis. 

## Public Forums.

TDPRI.COM offers User Reviews & Ratings and Discussion boards. TDPRI.COM users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose Personal Information to other users or third parties on the TDPRI.COM system, through email, or outside of the TDPRI.COM system, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other members or parties. While TDPRI.COM strives to protect your Personal Information, TDPRI.COM cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to TDPRI.COM and you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords or other account information.

## Links to Other Websites.

TDPRI.COM may provide links to its partners and other Internet sites. These sites have separate data and privacy practices independent of TDPRI.COM, and TDPRI.COM disclaims any responsibility or liability for their policies or actions. 

Correcting and Updating Your Information. You can view and make changes to the information you have previously provided to TDPRI.COM, by visiting your online Profile. [](https://web.archive.org/web/20090622035945id_/http%3A//www.tdpri.com/staff@allfordmail.com)

## Security.

To protect the security of your Personal Information, TDPRI.COM limits access to user data to authorized TDPRI.COM personnel. TDPRI.COM will NOT disclose any Personal Information except as described above or in its Terms & Conditions. TDPRI.COM may disclose user information, including demographic data, in an aggregated form that does not identify individual users in order to describe its services to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties and for other lawful purposes. TDPRI.COM may disclose information about you if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of TDPRI.COM or others. 

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, or if you believe TDPRI.COM has not adhered to these principles, please contact us at: [webmaster@tdpri.com](mailto:webmaster@tdpri.com)
