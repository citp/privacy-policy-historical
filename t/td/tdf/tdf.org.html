FUND’S 
        PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
      <p>Your privacy concerns are important to TDF. This Policy Statement is 
        designed to inform you about TDF’s privacy principles and its policy 
        regarding use data.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Overview</strong><br>
        The only information TDF obtains about individual visitors to its Web 
        site is that supplied voluntarily. Personally identifiable information 
        provided by a visitor (name, email or home address, etc.) will not be 
        disclosed to anyone unless the visitor expressly permits TDF to do so. 
      </p>
      <p>The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices:</p>
      <p><strong>Personally Identifying Information</strong><br>
        TDF does not require you to register or furnish any personal information 
        as a condition of using our Web site. We collect personally identifying 
        information only if you voluntarily provide it to us.</p>
      <p><strong>TDF logs Internet protocol (IP) addresses</strong> to conduct system administration, 
        report aggregate information, and conduct site analysis. An IP address 
        is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access 
        the Internet. All computer identification on the Internet is conducted 
        with IP addresses, which allow computers and servers to recognize and 
        communicate with each other. If a visitor requests pages from TDF, TDF 
        servers enter the visitor's IP address into a log. To maintain visitor 
        anonymity, TDF does not associate IP addresses with records containing 
        personal information. However, TDF will use IP addresses to identify any 
        visitors who refuse to comply with TDF's in-house rules or terms of service, 
        and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or 
        others.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies </strong><br>
        TDF uses cookies only to enhance your web browsing experience. (A cookie 
        is a unique number assigned to you and stored on a cookie file on your 
        computer). The first time TDF serves you a page, our site places a text 
        file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer. 
        Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's 
        hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Our site uses cookies only to identify 
        you during your visit; they do not contain personal information and we 
        do not use them to store personal information about you, track your movements 
        to other sites or sell information about you to others. </p>
      <p><strong>External Links</strong><br>
        In order to provide visitors with greater value, TDF may provide links 
        to various third-party Web sites. However, even if an affiliation exists 
        between TDF and that third-party site, TDF exercises no control over linked 
        sites, each of which maintains independent privacy and data collection 
        policies and procedures. If you visit a website which is linked to TDF, 
        you should consult that Web site’s privacy policy before providing 
        any personally identifying information.</p>
      <p><strong>Surveys and Questionnaires</strong><br>
        Our online surveys and questionnaires may ask visitors, on an anonymous 
        basis, for health and demographic information. If contact information 
        is requested, TDF will use it only for the purpose of contacting the visitor 
        when necessary. Demographic and profile data collected at our site is 
        not shared with others. <br>
        TDF may provide its users with chat rooms, forums, message boards and/or 
        news groups. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas 
        becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding 
        to disclose your personal information. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Security</strong><br>
        TDF’s Web site has security measures in place to protect the loss, 
        misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Personal information 
        furnished to TDF as part of its clinical trial survey is stored in a secured 
        database and always sent via an encrypted Internet channel. </p>
      <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes </strong><br>
        If we decide to change the privacy policy for tdf.org, we will post those 
        changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, 
        how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. 
      </p>

        <b>Theatre Development Fund (TDF)</b>, a not-for-profit organization, was created 
        in the conviction that the live theatrical arts afford a unique expression 
        of the human condition that must be sustained and nurtured. TDF's two-fold 
        mission is to identify and provide support, including financial assistance, 
        to theatrical works of artistic merit and to encourage and enable diverse 
        audiences to attend live theatre and dance in all their venues. Since 
        1968, Theatre Development Fund has developed an array of low-cost ticket 
        and production subsidy programs designed to increase the opportunities 
        for works of artistic merit to be written, produced and seen more widely. 
        TDF continues to seek additional ways to support the production of new 
        work and to broaden the public's awareness and access to live theatre 
        and dance. </p>
