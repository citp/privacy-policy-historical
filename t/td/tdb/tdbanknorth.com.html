			  The type of information we collect depends on the type of product or service you obtain from us. We may collect "nonpublic personal information" about you. "Nonpublic personal information" is information about you, which is not available from public sources, obtained in connection with providing you with a financial product or service. For example, nonpublic personal information includes information regarding your account balance, payment history and deposit account activity. We may collect this personal information from the following sources: 
<ul>
<li>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms you may complete and provide to us, such as your name, address, social security number, assets, income and, in the case of applications for insurance, health and medical information;
</li><li>Information about your transactions with us, with members of other TD Banknorth companies or others, such as your account balance, payment history, products and services used, credit card usage; and
</li><li>Information such as your creditworthiness and your payment history that we receive from third parties, such as credit bureaus.
</li></ul>
<p>
In some cases, we may obtain "protected health information" about you.  "Protected health information" is information provided by a third party such as an insurer, health plan, employer or health care provider that identifies you and relates to your health or health care, including payment for that care.  Among other things, TD Banknorth's insurance subsidiaries may obtain information regarding your medical condition if you apply for insurance coverage, and TD Banknorth may obtain information regarding medical treatment that you have received in the course of processing payments for that treatment.

<p>
TD Banknorth does not frequently hold protected health information, but, for example, it may receive protected health information from a health care provider to assist in processing payments to that provider.  Or, TD Banknorth's insurance subsidiaries may collect protected health information and provide it to an insurer to assist in processing an insurance claim, or if you enroll to be a participant in a health plan.  We are required to maintain the privacy of protected health information in accordance with the law and this notice, and to provide you with notice (including a paper notice upon request) of our legal duties and practices with respect to such information.  We do not share protected health information among our affiliates or with third parties except to process transactions or to provide services you have requested or initiated.  We may use or disclose protected health information, in connection with the payment or collection of health care costs or insurance premiums, or for purposes of insurance claim processing, enrollment or underwriting.  We will not use or disclose your protected health information for any other purpose without your written authorization, which you may revoke, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.
</p><p>
You have the right to request restrictions on our use or disclosure of your protected health information, although we are not required to agree to a requested restriction.  You have the right to request that we communicate your protected health information to you in a confidential manner.  You have the right to inspect, copy and, if it is erroneous, amend your protected health information.  And, you have the right to receive an accounting of disclosures of your protected health information, although that right does not apply to disclosures to you or for purposes of treatment, payment or health care operations.
</p><p>
You may make any complaint about our use or disclosure of protected health information directly to us, or to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and you will not be retaliated against for filing a complaint.  If you wish to complain to us, or if you have any questions, please contact us as follows: TD Banknorth Inc., P.O.
