## Our Online Privacy Code

Effective Date: April 6, 2018

Your privacy is important to us and we value your trust. This Online Privacy Code (this "Code") describes the online privacy practices of TD Bank, N.A. ("TD Bank," "we" or "us") and our affiliate, TD Ameritrade, applicable to consumers who visit, use or interact with our online services.

TD Bank-branded websites, mobile applications ("mobile apps," including those for use on tablets), electronic communications (such as email messages) with you, and digital advertising campaigns. 

**This Code explains the following:**

  * How we or TD Ameritrade, directly or through service providers (including advertising partners), may collect information: 
    * When you visit, use or interact with us through any of our online services; and
    * Through our advertisements ("ads") displayed via online services operated by us or third parties; and
  * How we, directly or through our service providers (including our advertising partners) may use or share information collected via our online services, and associate this information with other information about you.



**Consent:** By visiting or using any of our online services, responding to any electronic communications we may send you, or clicking on one of our ads, you agree to this Code. 

**Check the Effective Date:** This Code may be revised from time to time, so we encourage you to periodically check the current version available. If we revise this Code in a material way, we will change the "Effective" date shown at the top of this page and provide a conspicuous notice on [our website](https://www.tdbank.com/) before any changes take effect.

**Important – Customers:** If you have a financial product or service with us, we will use and share your personal information in accordance with the privacy notice that applies to your account. However, this Code may still be useful to you in describing our online services, and the options and choices described below are available to you as well.

#### CollapseOnline Advertising

We may advertise our products and services and personalize content through online services offered by us, our affiliates and third parties that are not affiliated with us, by using cookies, the mobile advertising identifier of your device and other tracking technologies. Some of our advertising partners may collect data from your mobile device, such as your website and app browsing habits and your mobile advertising identifier, and use it for "online behavioral advertising" (also referred to as "OBA" or "interest-based advertising"). We subscribe to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which promotes consumer awareness and choice about how consumers' information is used for OBA. To learn more about OBA, please visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>. 

Our personalized or tailored ads and content may include: 

  * Prescreened offers of credit;
  * Ads and content based upon your location ( _e.g._ , IP address or location of your mobile device), your computer(s) and mobile device(s), your visits to and use of online services offered by us or our affiliates, your customer relationship with us ( _e.g._ , contact information, and holdings, transactions, demographics and location) and other information described above;
  * Ads based upon the above information and your visits to and use of online services offered by non-affiliated third parties, which are referred to as "online behavioral advertising" ("OBA") or "interest-based advertising;"
  * Relationship-based ads (e.g., "promoted posts") on social media, search engine and webmail sites, based upon your contact information in our files; and
  * Ads on search engine websites based upon search terms that you enter on the search engine websites.



If you click on one of our ads, a cookie, the mobile advertising identifier of your device and other tracking technologies may be used to track the effectiveness of our advertising and to display tailored ads for our products or services.

**Opt-Out Options:**  
We do not respond to "do not track" signals transmitted by web browsers or similar mechanisms. However, several opt-out options are available to you: 

  * **_Our Opt-Outs_** : To opt out of personalized or interest-based content or ads on online services offered by us or third parties based upon your future visits to or use of our online services or your relationship with us, visit our [**Personalization and Advertising Preferences**](https://web.archive.org/bank/opt-out.html) page.
  * _OBA Opt-Out_ : To opt out of OBA, including targeted ads based upon your behavior on another computer or mobile device, use the following options: 
    * _Ads based upon your web browsing habits_ : Click the AdChoices icon on the ad and follow the instructions, or visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>; and
    * _Ads based upon your app browsing habits_ : Click the AdChoices icon on the ad and follow the instructions, or change the advertising settings offered by your mobile provider via your mobile device.
  * **_Other Opt Outs_** : Some search engine websites and social media platforms (e.g., Facebook) that display our search-based ads or relationship-based ads offer their own opt-outs. Please visit those sites and platforms for more information. 



Opting out through any of these means may not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or apps, but it may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. If you erase cookies from your browser, use a different browser, or reset the ad identifier on your device, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. In addition, we may still collect data in browsers and apps for other purposes such as market research, reporting and development of our products and services.

We or our advertising partners may use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or mobile device and collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on our websites. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such technologies.
