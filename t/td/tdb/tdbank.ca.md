**Privacy Code Table of Contents**

* * *

Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information has always been fundamental to the way we do business within the TD Bank Financial Group*. 

We strive to provide you with the best customer service. To us, that includes treating you fairly and with respect. 

This Privacy Code informs you of our policy on privacy, and tells you about the ways we ensure that your privacy and the confidentiality of your information are protected. 

**TD Bank Financial Group’s Privacy Policy**

Our privacy policy applies to personal customers, including individuals carrying on business alone or in partnership with other individuals. It consists of five key principles: 

1\. **Collecting and Using Information**

Either before or when we collect information about you, we will explain how we intend to use it. We will limit the information we collect to what we need for those purposes, and we will use it only for those purposes. We will obtain your consent if we wish to use your information for any other purpose and before collecting information from third parties such as credit bureaus. 

2\. **Releasing Information**

We may provide your information to other persons, but only: 

  * where we have your consent 
  * to our suppliers or agents who assist us in serving you 
  * where we are required or permitted to do so by law 



3\. **Protecting Information**

We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures. We will retain your information only for the time it is required for the purposes we explain.

4\. **Providing Information Access and Accuracy**

We will give you access to the information we retain about you. We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date.

5\. **Respecting and Responding to Your Privacy Concerns**

In this Privacy Code we will explain your options of refusing or withdrawing consent to the collection, use and release of your information, and we will record and respect your choices. We will investigate and respond to your concerns about any aspect of our handling of your information. In this Privacy Code we will explain how we fulfil each of these important principles.

In this Privacy Code site we will explain how we fulfil each of these important principles.

**Why We Ask For Your Information**

We ask you for information to establish and serve you as our customer. 

We obtain most of our information about you directly from you. The information we ask for depends on which product or service you want. For every product or service, we need your name, address and some identification. Here is why we need some of the other information we ask you to provide. 

• **Birth date**

This helps us identify you and ensure that no one is trying to impersonate you. We may also use it to determine your eligibility for products and services that may be of benefit to a particular age group.

• **Social Insurance Number (SIN)**

Your SIN is required for products which earn investment income, in order to comply with Revenue Canada's income reporting requirements. Providing your SIN for credit products is optional. If you provide your SIN, we also use it to keep your information separate from that of other customers with a similar name, including information we obtain with your consent through the credit approval process.

• **Financial information**

This is used to assess your eligibility for any credit product, for example, a TD Visa* card, line of credit or other loan. We also use it to ensure that the advice we give you or the investments you purchase (in the case of mutual funds or brokerage or investment accounts) are appropriate for you.

• **Health information**

This is required for some insurance products to ensure you are eligible for coverage. 

We only collect the information we need and only use it for the purposes explained to you. When you apply for a new product or service, we will indicate in the application or agreement how we intend to use your information. If we wish in the future to use it for another purpose, we will ask you for your consent at that time. We will only ask for the information we need for that particular product or service. We will indicate clearly which information would help us to serve you but is optional for you to provide.

**Serving You Better**

With your consent, we may share your information within the TD Bank Financial Group. This will help us serve you better and determine whether any products or services of the TD Bank Financial Group are suitable for you so that we can offer them to you.

We want to serve you better and meet your customer service expectations. Agreeing to let us share your information within the TD Bank Financial Group helps us to meet this goal.

It lets us instantly recognize your total relationship with the TD Bank Financial Group, no matter when or where you contact us or which one of us you contact. It also means that changes to your information, such as updated addresses or telephone numbers, can be made once and be effective for all your products or services with the TD Bank Financial Group.

Sharing your information also helps us determine your financial needs because it allows us to review what products of the TD Bank Financial Group you have and how you use them. We may then offer you other products and services of the TD Bank Financial Group - including special promotions - that we believe will be of interest to you.

_Please note that health information that may have been provided in connection with an insurance product is never shared._

This consent is optional and you can decide to withdraw it at any time. Please refer to the Recording Your Options section on this site. 

**Why We Ask Others For Information About You**

With your consent, we may obtain information about you from third parties, including through a credit check.

Obtaining additional information about you from parties outside the TD Bank Financial Group helps us assess your eligibility for our products.

For credit products, for example, we need to know your creditworthiness. For this reason, we may contact other lenders or credit bureaus to give us information on your credit history. We may also contact employers or other personal references to verify information that you have given us. We will not do this without your consent, but please remember that if you do not give your consent we may not be able to extend credit services to you.

**When We Release Your Information**

Under no circumstances do we sell customer lists or information to others. We release your information to parties outside the TD Bank Financial Group only under the following circumstances.

• **With your consent**

We will disclose your credit history with us to other lenders or credit bureaus in order to support the credit approval process. We release only the information required to identify you, as well as facts from our credit records about your repayment history.

• **For servicing purposes**

We give a limited amount of information, only as necessary, without your consent to our suppliers and agents; for example, cheque printers and bank card manufacturers who provide goods and services to you through us.

• **When required or permitted by law**

When required or permitted by law We must give information in response to a valid demand, search warrant or other legally valid enquiry or order. We may disclose information to help us collect a debt owed to us by you. We may also disclose information to an investigative body in the case of a breach of agreement or contravention of law – this helps prevent fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We will protect your information with appropriate safeguards and security measures.

We have thorough security standards to protect our systems and your information against unauthorized access and use.

For example, our systems have been designed to ensure that your Personal Identification Number (PIN), password and other access codes are always private and confidential. When you use your PIN at an automated banking machine, it is scrambled after you enter it. For your protection, your access codes are known only to you - our employees cannot gain access to them and they will not ask you to reveal them.

All our suppliers and agents, as part of their contracts with the TD Bank Financial Group, are bound to maintain your confidentiality and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose.

When we provide information in response to a legal enquiry or order, we ensure that the order is valid and we disclose only the information that is legally required. 

All employees of the TD Bank Financial Group are familiar with the procedures that must be taken to safeguard customer information. And to us, protecting the confidentiality of your information is more than a procedure - it's part of our jobs. It is specified in our employment agreements and regularly confirmed in writing.

We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure that they are being properly administered and that they remain effective and appropriate.

We retain your information only as long as it is required for the reasons it was collected.

The length of time we retain information varies depending on the product or service and the nature of the information. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us but only for so long as it is legally necessary for us to have sufficient information to respond to any issue that may arise at a later date. When your information is no longer needed for the purposes explained to you, we have procedures to destroy, delete, erase or convert it to an anonymous form.

**Your Right To Access Your Information**

We will give you access to the information we have about you.

Most of this information is in the form of your transaction records. These are available to you through your account statements or passbook updates, by visiting the branch or office where your account is held, or by accessing your account through our web or telephone banking and brokerage services.

If you require other information, simply contact the branch or office where your account is maintained. We will ask you for specific details such as branch and account number. We will advise you in advance if a minimal charge will be required for conducting the search, and we will respond to your request within 30 days.

Please note that we may not be able to provide information about you from our records which contains references to other persons which is subject to legal privilege, contains confidential information proprietary to the TD Bank Financial Group, relates to an investigation of a breach of agreement or contravention of laws, or cannot be disclosed for other legal reasons. Also, we do not maintain disclosure records for regular or routine actions such as T5 or other reports to Revenue Canada, regular updating of credit information to credit bureaus, or account balance deficiencies through the return of NSF items.

If you have any questions regarding decisions made about you, we will tell you the reasons for those decisions. Where relevant, we will provide you with the name and address of the credit bureau from which a report was obtained.

**Keeping Your Information Accurate**

We will make every reasonable effort to keep your information accurate and up-to-date.

Having accurate information about you enables us to give you the best possible service. Allowing us to share your information within the TD Bank Financial Group means updates to your information can be made once and be effective for all the products and services you have with the TD Bank Financial Group.

You can help by keeping us informed of any changes such as if you move or change telephone numbers. If you find any errors in our information about you, let us know and we will make the corrections immediately and make sure they are conveyed to anyone we may have misinformed. For information that remains in dispute, we will note your opinion in the file.

**Recording Your Options**

We will explain your options of refusing or withdrawing consent to the collection, use or release of your information, and we will record and respect your choices.

In most cases you are free to refuse or withdraw your consent at any time. You may do so by contacting the branch or office where your account is held or by calling1-866-567-8888. Our staff will be pleased to explain your options and any consequences of refusing or withdrawing your consent, and record your options.

If you don't want us to share information within the TD Bank Financial Group or contact you with product information, you can tell us so at any time. You can choose, for instance, not to receive centralized direct mail or telephone marketing, or to receive information only for certain products. Our staff will guide you through the numerous choices. You will continue to receive product brochures and messages included in account statements. 

You can change your options at any time. You may refuse consent for us to do a credit check, but we may not be able to extend credit services to you. Once you have a credit product, you may not withdraw your consent to share your credit experience with other lenders and credit bureaus, as this is necessary to support the credit approval process.

**Your Concerns Matter To Us**

If you have any concerns or questions about privacy and confidentiality - or any concerns about the way a request for information was handled - you can take the following actions.

Begin by contacting the manager of your TD branch or the office that handles your account. They have the decision-making authority to resolve most concerns. As a next step, call 1-866-567-8888. They will ensure that your concerns are addressed to the Senior Vice President responsible for privacy in the business where your account is held, so that further action is taken to resolve the matter.

If after contacting TD Canada Trust, your problem or concern remains unresolved, please contact the TD Ombudsman at Toronto Dominion Bank, Box 1, TD Centre, Toronto, Ontario M5K 1A2 or toll-free at 1-888-361-0319. Within five business days of receiving your enquiry, the TD Ombudsman will write or call to tell you the problem has been resolved or, in more complex cases, advise you what further steps are being taken and when you can expect a resolution. 

If your concern remains unresolved, you can contact The Canadian Banking Ombudsman at 4950 Yonge Street, Suite 1602, North York, Ontario M2N 6K1 or toll-free at 1-888-451-4519. You may contact the banking industry's regulator at The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Kent Square, 255 Albert Street, Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0H2 or toll free at 1-800-385-8647.

Why We Ask Others For Information About You  


Protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information has always been fundamental to the way we do business with you within TD Bank Financial Group, whether over the Internet, on the telephone or at our branches and offices.

We developed our Privacy Code, Protecting Your Privacy, to inform you of our policy on privacy and tell you about the ways we ensure that your privacy and the confidentiality of your information are protected.

Many of you have questions about how we are handling the information we obtain from you when you visit our websites. This On-Line Privacy Policy will answer your questions about the information we collect when you visit a website of the TD Bank Financial Group and how we use it.

**Visiting Our Information Sites**

When you go directly to the information portion of our websites and move from page to page, read pages or download content onto your computer, we learn which pages are visited, what content is downloaded, and the address of websites that you visited immediately before coming to our websites. However, none of this is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate.

We use this information to find out how many people visit our websites and which sections of the sites are visited the most frequently. This helps us to know what type of information is most useful to you so that we can improve our websites to make it easier for you to access information. We record the statistical information on the numbers of visitors to our websites, but no information about you in particular will be kept or used.

**Using our Internet Transaction Services**

When you register for one of our Internet transaction services, such as Web Banking, we compile a profile for you for that service (eg. name, address, account numbers, logon ID etc.). Each time you use our Internet services, we collect your logon ID, information about the transactions that you complete and the informational pages of the Web that you visit while using the service. 

We use your profile in responding to your enquiries on the service. We use your logon ID to identify you as a user of the service. We use the transaction information in the aggregate to assess and improve the service. We use specific transaction information for servicing purposes (eg. billing). We use both your transaction information and the informational pages of the Web that you have visited to determine your financial needs so that we can offer other TD Bank Financial Group products and services to you. 

**Cookies**

There are two common types of cookies, “session cookies” and “persistent cookies”. Session cookies store information only for the length of time that you are connected to a website - they are not written onto your hard drive. Once you leave the Web site, the originator of the cookie no longer has the information that was contained on it.

TD Bank Financial Group uses session cookies as an additional security feature for its Web online services. For example, when you login to any Web service and are authenticated through your login ID and password, a cookie will store the identification number of your browser. Throughout your session, the session cookie acts as a type of digital signature to identify your current session to the Web Server.

The Web Server will monitor the number of your browser to ensure that, at all times during your session, we are dealing with you.

We also use session cookies to track your visits within our site. We use that information to determine the type of information that you are looking for in our site and to improve our site. We use information about the site you visited immediately prior to our site to assess the viability of links to our site that we have created on third party sites.

The information stored in “persistent cookies” is written onto your hard drive and remains there until the expiry date of the cookie. TD Bank Financial Group uses persistent cookies to store non-sensitive information that you are aware of and have agreed to. For example, if you choose the option on our login screen to remember your Connect ID for Web Banking or WebBroker, the system will remember and automatically input your logon id each time you use the service.

Currently, most browsers do not distinguish between session cookies and persistent cookies. For Web services to operate, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you are concerned about having your browser enabled to accept cookies while you are surfing other Web sites, we recommend that you enable your browser to notify you when it is receiving a cookie. This gives you the ability of accepting or rejecting any cookie presented by the Web server you are visiting.

**E-mail Comments, Questions or Responses**

When you send us an e-mail or when you ask us to respond to you by e-mail, we learn your exact e-mail address and any information you have included in the e-mail.

We use your e-mail address to acknowledge your comments and/or reply to your questions, and we will store your communication and our reply in case we correspond further. We will not sell your e-mail address to anyone outside the TD Bank Financial Group. We may use your e-mail address to send you information about products or services of the TD Bank Financial Group that we believe may be of interest to you. If you don't want us to contact you with product information by e-mail, you may tell us so at any time.

If you have asked us to put you on an e-mail mailing list to provide you with certain information on a regular basis, or we send you information about our products and services by e-mail, you may ask us to remove you from the list at any time (using the unsubscribe instructions provided with each e-mail and on the site where you signed up).

Remember E-mail over the Internet is generally unencrypted. If as part of an application TD Bank Financial Group requests that you transmit confidential information to us over the Internet, we ensure that such transmission is encrypted. We recommend that you use caution when forwarding free-format e-mail messages to us and that you do not include confidential information (such as account numbers, etc) on those messages as they are not encrypted.

**Responding to Games, Contests or Surveys**

When you submit your answers to a game or contest or submit your response to a survey question, we learn your answer or any opinions or information that you volunteer.

We will use your submission for the purpose of awarding a prize in a contest. We use your submission to come up with the game or survey results, and we may publish those results in aggregate on our websites. We may use your response to improve our website or other products or services of the TD Bank Financial Group. Based on your response, we may forward information about our offers of products or services of the TD Bank Financial Group that we believe may be of interest to you.
