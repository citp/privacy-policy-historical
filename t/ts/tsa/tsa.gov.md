## How TSA Uses Cookies

The Office of Management and Budget Memo [M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf) allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.

When you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on your computer. Placing cookie text allows websites to “remember” visitors’ preferences, surfing patterns and behavior while they are connected.

The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of webpages. Cookies from tsa.gov webpages only collect information about your browser’s visit to the site; they do not collect any personal information about you.

There are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.

Session Cookies: TSA uses session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1-Single Session.” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session Web measurement and customization technologies."

Persistent Cookies: TSA uses persistent cookies to differentiate between new and returning visitors to our site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to tsa.gov for six months. TSA also uses persistent cookies to block repeated invitations to take our customer satisfaction survey. The persistent cookies that block repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2-Multi-session without personally identifiable information (PII).” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected."

3rd party software, modules, or add-ins being leveraged on TSA website may or may not use persistent cookies or similar technology; however, no data collected in this manner is accessible, viewable, or retained by the federal government.

If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can opt out or disable cookies in your browser. You will still have access to all information and resources on the TSA website. However, turning off cookies may affect the functioning of some of the TSA website. Be aware that disabling cookies in your browser will affect cookie usage at all other websites you visit as well.

TSA currently uses Google Analytics to perform web measurements and analytics. Google Analytics sets a single session cookie and three persistent cookies that expire up to two years after they are set.

## Email

You may choose to provide personal information in an email. TSA uses the information to improve customer service or to respond to a question. Sometimes TSA may forward your email to other government employees who may be better able to assist. Please do not include sensitive personally identifiable information (e.g. social security numbers, passport or alien registration numbers) in an email.

TSA uses the official social media accounts to engage with and provide information to the public. TSA cannot guarantee a response to all comments and questions due to volume. If you have a travel related issue or question that requires immediate assistance, you can contact TSA.

The views expressed in visitor comments reflect those of the comment’s author and do not necessarily reflect the official views of TSA or the federal government.

TSA does not guarantee or warrant that any information posted by individuals is correct, and disclaims any liability for any loss or damage resulting from reliance on any such information. TSA may not be able to verify, does not warrant or guarantee, and assumes no liability for anything posted by any other person. TSA does not endorse, support or otherwise promote any private or commercial entity or the information, products or services contained that may be reached through links posted by others in comments.

TSA does not moderate comments prior to posting, but reserves the right to delete comments that contain:

  * Obscene or threatening language or discrimination targeting individuals or groups.
  * Threats or defamatory statements.
  * Promotion of services or products (not including non-commercial links that are relevant to the topic).
  * Suggestions or encouragement of illegal activity.
  * Personal or sensitive information (phone numbers, email or postal addresses).
