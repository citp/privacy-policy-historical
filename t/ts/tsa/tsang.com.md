As you use our website, we will collect information in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions. We recognize that we must maintain and use your information responsibly. We will not sell the information you provide to us to third parties.

**Our Privacy Policy**  Updated: July 2014

When you place an order with tsang.com, you will be asked to provide your name, email and postal addresses and phone number.  Your credit card numbers will be provided to paypal trough their state of the art secure servers.

**How does tsang.com use my information?**  
When you make a purchase from tsang.com, we use your information to process your order. We will also send you emails to confirm your order and may need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have other questions regarding your order.

**What are cookies? How does tsang.com use cookies on its site?**

A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer’s hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you’ve visited. We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie.

We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. Cookies enable us to keep track of your order as you shop on our site.

Through our use of cookies, we also track and maintain the identity of the web site you visited immediately prior to visiting our website. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, we will not be able to track your order to enable you to purchase from our site. Nor will we be able to recognize you as a registered user, which allows you to access your account information.

**How do I know my order information is secure?**  
We process payments through PayPal who uses Verisign’s industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from “http” to “https.”

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don’t permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at tsang.com. In that case, you’ll be unable to connect to the server, which means you won’t be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please your order by email [customerservice@tsang.com](mailto:customerservice@tsang.com)
