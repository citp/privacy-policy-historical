## Privacy Policy Overview

We take your privacy very seriously. TSheets will not disclose any personally identifiable information about you to any other entity except as required to do business or to resolve legal matters. (For example, to receive payments TSheets must disclose personal billing information to an authorized credit-card processing company.) All information you submit is stored on servers that have strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access. To further protect your privacy, Secure SSL connections are always used when transmitting sensitive information and all credit-card numbers are encrypted on our system's disk drives.

TSheets may update this policy at any time for any reason. If there are any significant changes to how we handle personal information we will send a notice either to the email address used to register your TSheets account, or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
