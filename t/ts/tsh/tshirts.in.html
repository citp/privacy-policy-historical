            we will do so in the manner as prescribed by law.<br>
            <br>
            Such interception, disclosure, monitoring and storage may take place

            necessary, and solely for the purposes of providing the Service to 
            you, you agree that we may disclose to such third party any of your 
            Personal Information that may be necessary for the procurement of 
            services from the third party. </font></p></td>
