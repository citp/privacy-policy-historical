**Click-Through URLs.** In some of our emails we may use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Site. When Users click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We may track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications.

3)   **How do we use the information you provide us?** We use PII such as your contact information to provide you with the various Services and features and to potentially serve you with advertising while on the Site. All information that you submit to us is governed by this Privacy Policy, the T&Cs and any other rules.

    * Unless you opt-out, we may use your e-mail or other PII to send commercial or marketing messages without your further consent.  Be advised that we use your e-mail address and other contact information provided by you to contact you regarding your Submissions.  We may also use your e-mail address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Site or Service changes or customer service purposes). 
    * You may opt-out at any time by changing your preferences, editing your profile online or unsubscribing to our emails.
    * We use both your PII and certain non-PII (such as anonymous user data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, click stream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Site, Software and Services and to create new features, promotions, functionality and services by storing, tracking, analyzing and processing User preferences and trends, as well as User activity and communications. 
    * We use information collected during submission of Surveys and signups for Newsletters to send both the information as requested and additional information about our company, Site, Software or Services. Further, the information collected, including any demographics, is used to learn more about the types of people who visit our Site and improve our services.



If any financial information is collected it will be used only to bill you for Services or features you’ve requested.  If you used a credit card to pay for any Service, your credit card information may be subject to verification by the issuing credit card company or other third party company.  Unless you give us permission at the time such information is collected, this information will not be used for any purpose except for the fulfillment and record keeping of current and future transactions.

Our Services connect with and rely on various third party websites and tools unrelated to FSS. In an attempt to provide increased value to our Users, we may also choose various third party web Sites, such as Google, Yahoo and Bing, to link to, connect with or frame within the Site. We also may participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer other services and features to our Users. We have no control over these linked Sites and third party services, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us.  We encourage you to read the policies of these third party websites. By engaging with third party websites, services and tools through our Site, Software and Services, you consent to our providing your PII to those third parties. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party websites (even if offered on or through our Site) may not be received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for the independent policies or actions of third parties, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such website or services. These linked sites, services and tools are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the services and the links placed upon each of them and therefore request any feedback.

Further, any linking with any other website is neither an endorsement of that website nor any of the products or services that may be offered on that website. ** **

**Note:**   Your PII or financial information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets of FSS or a bankruptcy. We may also disclose PII or financial information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of FSS or other Users of the Site or Services.  Whenever PII or financial information is disclosed under this paragraph, we may also disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis.

4)   **How does FSS Protect Users Personal Information?   **We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your PII on our systems.  When you enter sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Please be aware that emails or other messages you send to us are not necessarily secure against interception and you should not include sensitive information in those messages. We generally will not ask for your credit or debit card number, password or other sensitive information in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be fraudulent.

Except for SSL transmissions, the Site is not encrypted. Access to your Account profile is restricted by your password.

  
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  

Third parties may unlawfully attempt to intercept or access transmissions or private communications and other Users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site.  Although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

 5)  **Individuals under 13 years of age.**

Pursuant to the provisions of the 1998 Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), our policy is to refuse individuals under 13 years of age access to the Site.  We therefore do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 13 years of age. 

6)  **Does FSS Use Cookies?** We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make the Site and Services easier to use, to improve our advertising, and to protect both you, the Site and the Services. We also use cookies to record Users' preferences, record session information, customize Site and Service content and alert Users to new items of interest. We may store your email address or login ID to recognize you every time you return to the Site.  You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.  If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see  

7)  **How do you change PII provided or OPT-OUT?   **FSS gives our registered Users an option for modifying or removing some of the information that we have about them from our database. To update, modify or delete some of the information that we have on file for you, you may edit your online Account profile, if you have one.  We will comply with your requests as reasonably as we can. Please note that we require some PII for billing purposes. If you wish to delete certain PII required for Account maintenance such as your name, e-mail address or billing information, you may be required to terminate your Account.  However, please note, that while you may remove some of your PII from the Site at any time, you acknowledge that we may retain archived or cached copies of your PII. The above notwithstanding, not all PII monitored, stored, tracked or submitted to us is controllable by you through your Account profile and may not be removed from the Site or our Services.  You may unsubscribe (opt-out) from any email list simply by clicking the unsubscribe link contained in every marketing message sent.

8)   **How Long Do We Keep your Information?** Except as otherwise provided, User’s PII is maintained by us no longer than necessary for the purposes set out and in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.  When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for we look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.  In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

9)  **By visiting and using the Site, Software and Services,** you consent to the collection and use of information by us as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes within this page so Users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

Be sure to review our Privacy Policy, T&Cs and any rules regularly so that you will be aware of any changes to them.  Please remember that your continued use of this Site, and/or maintenance of an Account after changes or revisions have been made constitute your acceptance of such updates.
