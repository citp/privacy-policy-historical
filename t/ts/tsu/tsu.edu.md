# Texas Southern University > Privacy & Security

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Texas Southern University Website (www.tsu.edu):

**Information gathering**  
TSU does not track personal information from its Web site visitors (collect "cookies"). We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site by identifying (1) which parts of our site are most heavily used, and (2) which portion of our audience comes from within the Texas Southern network. This information is used solely for evaluating and improving web site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that user sessions will be tracked, but the users will remain anonymous. In addition, our staff occasionally monitors search terms that users enter into the TSU search engine but this tracking is never associated with individual users.

**Use of Information**  
The TSU staff uses the information gathered above to tailor site content to user needs and to generate aggregate statistical reports. At no time do we disclose site usage by individual IP addresses. Web server logs are retained on a temporary basis and then deleted completely from our systems.

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.

**Legal Disclaimer**  
The TSU Website contains links to other independently run Websites within the Texas Southern University network and to some sites outside the "tsu.edu" domain. TSU specifically disclaims any and all liability for any claims or damages that may result from providing the website or the information it contains, including any websites maintained by third parties and linked to the TSU web site. TSU makes no effort to independently verify, and does not exert editorial control over, information on pages outside of the "tsu.edu" domain and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.

In addition, although reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that electronic information on the TSU web site is complete, accurate and timely, TSU does not represent that the information is complete, accurate and timely in all instances and assumes no responsibility for the use of the information provided.
