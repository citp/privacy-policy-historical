     Your browser software can be set to reject all Cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to
     reset the browser to reject Cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our Cookies,
     certain of the functions and conveniences of our website may not work properly but you do not have

     C. Children
     We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We do not collect Personally Identifiable
     Information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. A parent or guardian is solely
     responsible for providing supervision of the minor's use of Takeshapeforlife.com. The parent or
     guardian assumes full responsibility for ensuring that the registration information is kept secure and
     that the information submitted is accurate. The parent or guardian also assumes full responsibility for
     the interpretation and use of any information or suggestions provided through Takeshapeforlife.com
     for the minor. Takeshapeforlife.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell
     children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use Takeshapeforlife.com
     only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
     D. Market Research
     From time to time the Takeshapeforlife.com marketing department, or operations contractors acting
     on its behalf, may conduct online research surveys in order to gather feedback about our site through
     email invitations, pop-up surveys or online focus groups. When participating in a survey, we may
     ask you to submit Personally Identifiable Information. This Personally Identifiable Information is


    used for research purposes, and is not used for sales solicitations. When a third party sponsors a
    survey, Aggregate Information of the survey results is reported to the sponsor. Aggregate data does
    not contain any information that could be used to contact or identify you. Personally Identifiable
    Information collected through market research will only be used by Takeshapeforlife.com and its
    operations contractors and will not be given or sold to a third party without your consent.
IV. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, Takeshapeforlife.com will not
disclose any Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information it gathers from you on our website.
We will only release Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information to third parties: (1) to comply
with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in
special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others. In the event that we are legally compelled to
disclose your Personally Identifiable or Personal Health Information to a third party, we will attempt to
notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. In addition, we may disclose Personal
Information as described below.
Takeshapeforlife.com operations and maintenance contractors sometimes have limited access to your
Personally Identifiable Information in the course of providing products or services to
Takeshapeforlife.com. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology,
services, and/or content related to better operation and maintenance of our website. Access to your
Personally Identifiable Information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably
necessary for the contractor to perform its limited function for Takeshapeforlife.com. We also
contractually require that our operations and maintenance contractors:
    1) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information consistent with this Privacy Policy
    2) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing
         us with products and services
