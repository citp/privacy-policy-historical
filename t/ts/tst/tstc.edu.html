              and respects your privacy. TSTC collects Web traffic information 
              on TSTC Web sites for analysis and statistical purposes to better 
              understand our customer needs. This information is not reported 
              or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable 
              information, and will not be released to any outside parties unless 
              legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations 
              or other legal proceedings. <br>

            <p class="heading2"> Server Log Analysis </p>
            <p class="bodytext">TSTC uses server log analysis tools to create 
              summary statistics, which are used for purposes such as assessing 
              what information is of most interest, determining technical design 
              specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. 
              The following information is collected from server logs for analysis<br>
               </p><ul class="doubledot"><li>User Client hostname - The hostname (or IP address if DNS is disabled) 
              of the user/client requesting access.</li><li>HTTP header, "user-agent" 
              - The user-agent information includes the type of browser, its version, 
              and the operating system it's running on.</li><li>HTTP header, "referrer" 
              - The referrer specifies the page from which the client accessed 
              the current page. System date - The date and time of the user/client 
              request.</li><li>Full request - The exact request the user/client made.</li>
              <li>Status - The status code the server returned to the user/client.</li><li> 
              Content length - The content length, in bytes, of the document sent 
              to the user/client.</li><li>Method - The request method used.</li><li> Universal 
              Resource Identifier (URI) - The location of a resource on the server.</li><li> 
              Query string of the URI - Anything after the question mark in a 
              URI.</li><li> Protocol - The transport protocol and version used.</li></ul>
			<p class="heading2">1. Cookies</p>
            <p class="bodytext"> TSTC uses cookies for analysis and statistical 
              purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers' needs. 
              TSTC Web sites may also use cookies to provide interactive pages, 
              such as Web-based forms and surveys. A cookie file is an electronic 
              record containing unique information a web site can use to track 
              such things as passwords; lists of pages visited; and the date when 
              a specific page was accessed; or to identify a user session at a 
              particular web site. A cookie is often used in commercial sites 
              to identify the items selected for a specific shopping cart or web 
              portal. TSTC Web sites may require the use of cookies to facilitate 
              applications that display user-specific web pages. Any information 
              that TSTC may store in cookies is used exclusively for internal 
              purposes and will not disclose personally identifiable information 
              to outside parties unless legally required to do so in connection 
              with legal proceedings or law enforcement agencies. Individual departments 
              at TSTC that collect personal information about visitors and use 
              that information for purposes other than those stated above will 
              have a separate privacy statement that will inform how that information 
              is used. 
              </p><p class="heading2">2. Email</p><p class="bodytext">
              State agencies may not sell or release the e-mail addresses of members 
              of the public that have been provided to communicate electronically 
              with a government body without the affirmative consent of the affected 
              member of the public. Personally identifiable information contained 
              in a question or comment sent to TSTC in an e-mail message or submitted 
              in an online form is only used by TSTC to respond to the request 
              and to analyze trends. TSTC may redirect the message to another 
              government agency or person who is in a better position to answer 
              the question. </p><p class="heading2">3. Web Forms </p><p class="bodytext">TSTC uses Web-based forms to collect 
              survey results, to provide online registration for some TSTC-sponsored 
              events, and other internal business operations. Personally identifiable 
              information collected from these forms has a specified use (for 
              example, registration, survey response, etc.) and TSTC uses the 
              information only for that purpose. </p><p class="heading2">4. Security Measures</p><p class="bodytext">In some 
              cases TSTC uses a secure socket layer (SSL) connection to enhance 
              the security of any information you choose to submit to us on our 
              Web site. In other areas of our Web site, we provide only the security 
              necessary to maintain our Web site and information we provide to 
              you. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service 
              remains available to all users, TSTC employs software programs to 
              monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload 
              or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized 
              law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify 
              individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for 
              no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance 
              with the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. Unauthorized 
              attempts to upload information or change information on this service 
              are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Texas Penal 
              Code Chapters 33 (Computer Crimes) or 33A (Telecommunications Crimes).

              Links to sub pages, where appropriate are allowed. We reserve the 
              right to change sub pages at any time without notice, so it is up 
              to the user to continuously verify links to TSTC sub pages. TSTC 
              web site pages may not be captured within frames, or otherwise presented 
              as content belonging to anyone other than TSTC. Any link to TSTC 
              sites should be a full forward link that passes the client browser 
              to the respective TSTC site unencumbered. The BACK button should 
              return the visitor to your site if the visitor wishes to back out. 
              Links to individual graphics or tables within TSTC pages, especially 
              in an effort to place the downloading burden on our servers, is 
              forbidden. Such an action may be considered a misuse of state resources 
              and subject to legal action.
