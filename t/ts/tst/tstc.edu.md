Privacy & Security 

Texas State Technical College System (TSTC) values and respects your privacy. TSTC collects Web traffic information on TSTC Web sites for analysis and statistical purposes to better understand our customer needs. This information is not reported or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information, and will not be released to any outside parties unless legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings.

1\. Cookies

TSTC uses cookies for analysis and statistical purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers' needs. TSTC Web sites may also use cookies to provide interactive pages, such as Web-based forms and surveys. A cookie file is an electronic record containing unique information a web site can use to track such things as passwords; lists of pages visited; and the date when a specific page was accessed; or to identify a user session at a particular web site. A cookie is often used in commercial sites to identify the items selected for a specific shopping cart or web portal. TSTC Web sites may require the use of cookies to facilitate applications that display user-specific web pages. Any information that TSTC may store in cookies is used exclusively for internal purposes and will not disclose personally identifiable information to outside parties unless legally required to do so in connection with legal proceedings or law enforcement agencies. Individual departments at TSTC that collect personal information about visitors and use that information for purposes other than those stated above will have a separate privacy statement that will inform how that information is used. 

2\. Email

State agencies may not sell or release the e-mail addresses of members of the public that have been provided to communicate electronically with a government body without the affirmative consent of the affected member of the public. Personally identifiable information contained in a question or comment sent to TSTC in an e-mail message or submitted in an online form is only used by TSTC to respond to the request and to analyze trends. TSTC may redirect the message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer the question. 

3\. Web Forms 

TSTC uses Web-based forms to collect survey results, to provide online registration for some TSTC-sponsored events, and other internal business operations. Personally identifiable information collected from these forms has a specified use (for example, registration, survey response, etc.) and TSTC uses the information only for that purpose. 

4\. Security Measures

In some cases TSTC uses a secure socket layer (SSL) connection to enhance the security of any information you choose to submit to us on our Web site. In other areas of our Web site, we provide only the security necessary to maintain our Web site and information we provide to you. For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, TSTC employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Texas Penal Code Chapters 33 (Computer Crimes) or 33A (Telecommunications Crimes).
