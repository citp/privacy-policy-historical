**Using credit scoring**

When you apply for credit, an automated system known as  [credit scoring](http://www.tsb.co.uk/straightforward-money/managing-your-credit-score/16062210151258/ "credit scoring")  may be used when considering whether to agree the borrowing. It is a method of assessing your likely conduct of an account based on a range of data, including the conduct of previous similar accounts. It is a system widely used by credit providers to help make fair and informed decisions on lending.

Credit scoring takes account of information from three sources - the information you provide on your application, information provided by credit reference agencies and information that may already be held about you by us. A credit scoring system will consider information from these sources, to make an overall assessment of your application. The credit scoring methods used are regularly tested to ensure they remain fair, effective and unbiased.

Using a credit scoring system helps us to lend responsibly. If you submit an application and it is declined through this automated process, you can contact us within 21 days to have the decision reconsidered. You also have the right to ask that the decision is not made based solely using a credit scoring system.

**Searching insurance records**

If you apply to us for insurance, we will pass your details to the insurer. If you make a claim, any information you give to us, or to the insurer, may be put onto a register of claims and shared with other insurers to prevent fraudulent claims. A list of the participants is available from the insurer. We may also disclose your information to our agents and other insurers to investigate or prevent fraud.

**How we manage sensitive personal information**

The Data Protection Act defines certain information as 'sensitive' (racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual life, criminal proceedings and offences). If you apply to us for insurance we may ask you for some 'sensitive' information, but we will always ask for your explicit consent. As a customer, there may also be times when you give us 'sensitive' information. We will use it to provide the service you require and may share it with our subcontractors to keep our records up to date.

**How we check your identity**

We may ask you to provide physical forms of identity verification when you open your account. Alternatively, we may search credit reference agency files in assessing your application. The agency also gives us other details and information from the Electoral Register to verify your identity. The agency keeps a record of our search, whether or not your application proceeds. Our search is not seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit.

**Undertaking anti-money laundering checks**

To comply with money laundering regulations, there are times when we need to confirm (or reconfirm) the name and address of our customers. For more details about identity checks, please refer to  [What proof of identity can I use?](https://web.archive.org/current-accounts/faqs/identity/ "What proof of identity can I use?")

**Obtaining information about you, and other personal details**

When you apply for a mortgage or further borrowing it may be necessary to obtain references, details of your existing financial commitments, and any other information that is required to assess or review lending risks, to recover debts, and to prevent or detect fraud. Where applicable, your current and previous employers, accountant, landlord, lender, bank, insurance or pension company may be contacted to obtain this information. In limited circumstances these references may need to be obtained after you open your account. This may be for regulatory purposes, or if the lending decision needs to be reviewed. Your permission to obtain these references will therefore continue to apply after your account has been opened. It may also be necessary to obtain information or documentation from your solicitor relating to any work they carry out either on your or our behalf.

**Recording phone calls**

We may monitor or record phone calls with you in case we need to check we have carried out your instructions correctly, to resolve queries or issues, for regulatory purposes, to help improve our quality of service, and to help detect or prevent fraud or other crimes.

Conversations may also be monitored for staff training purposes.

We may also use interactive voice recognition technology to help us manage your account and provide you with the services you require.

**Using information on social networking sites**

As part of our ongoing commitment to understanding our customers better, we may research comments and opinions made public on social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.

**Obtaining a copy of your information**

Under the Data Protection Act 1998 you have the right of access to your personal data. The Act allows us to charge a fee of £10 for this service. To request your information please print off the  [Data Subject Access Request Form](https://web.archive.org/privacy/tsb-dsar-form.pdf "Data Subject Access Request Form")  read the guidance attached then complete and sign the form and send it to the below address. An acknowledgement letter will be issued to you by the DSAR team following receipt of your request.
