# About the TSBVI Web Site

This page and the entire TSBVI World Wide Web site strives to be accessible to all people.

### Purpose

The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired World Wide Web site reflects the schools vision of serving as a leading center of educational expertise for students with visual impairments. The TSBVI website strives to be a model for web site design to ensure the information is accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Such information can be easily transformed into Braille, large print, voice output, and regular text. As a technical information resource, the site will focus on four areas:

> **Training** \- materials to support training and education, announcements of upcoming training events, and provision of on-line training

> **Research** \- provide for the ongoing development and dissemination of research information developed here at TSBVI, within the State of Texas, and elsewhere. It is our hope that such information will coordinate the efforts of professionals working in the classroom, educational center, and academic context

> **Curricula** \- provide for the efficient sharing of information concerning education of students with visual impairments.

> **Technical** \- provide resources for professionals, parents, and lay persons associated with programs for the visually impaired and deaf/blind throughout the state, country, and world

All resources on the TSBVI Web page are in the public domain unless otherwise noted. You are welcome to use these resources as needed provided that the TSBVI Web page is cited as the source. A basic tenet of TSBVI is to promote the collegial sharing of information. You are invited to submit items for publication on the website. In all cases author contact information will be included. In this manner, we hope to build a valuable resource to promote the development of instructional materials and resources.

### Accessibility Policy

The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (TSBVI) is committed to making its Web site accessible to all users. To make the site more accessible, we include several features designed to improve accessibility for users with disabilities. Some of these features are described below.

A descriptive text equivalent is provided for images and other non-text elements, aiding users who listen to the content of the site by using a screen reader, rather than reading the site.

Major reports and other publications that are on the Web site are generally available in HTML or other accessible format. When publishing a document in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), we will also post an accessible version.

TSBVI is committed to making its Web site accessible according to the standards set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT) and the [Section 508 Web Accessibility Standards.](http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12#Web) To improve the accessibility of our Web site, we test any major redesign with screen readers and other tools. The results of these reviews are incorporated into the Web site.

TSBVI welcomes comments on how to improve the site's accessibility for users with disabilities. If you use assistive technology and the format of any material on our Web site interferes with your ability to access the information, please [contact the webmaster](mailto:jimallan@tsbvi.edu). To enable us to respond in a manner most helpful to you, please indicate the nature of your accessibility problem, the preferred format in which to receive the material, the Web address of the requested material, and your contact information. 

Additional information about accessibility programs in Texas is available from the [Governor's Committee on People with Disabilities](http://www.governor.state.tx.us/disabilities).

If you have a visual impairment there are many options which you can control from the selection of an accessible browser to modifying your browser to meet your needs.
