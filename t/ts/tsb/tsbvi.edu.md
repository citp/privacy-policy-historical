# About the TSBVI Web Site

This page and the entire TSBVI World Wide Web site strives to be accessible to all people.

### Purpose

The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired World Wide Web site reflects the schools vision of serving as a leading center of educational expertise for students with visual impairments. The TSBVI website strives to be a model for web site design to ensure the information is accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Such information can be easily transformed into Braille, large print, voice output, and regular text. As a technical information resource, the site will focus on four areas:

> **Training** \- materials to support training and education, announcements of upcoming training events, and provision of on-line training

> **Research** \- provide for the ongoing development and dissemination of research information developed here at TSBVI, within the State of Texas, and elsewhere. It is our hope that such information will coordinate the efforts of professionals working in the classroom, educational center, and academic context

> **Curricula** \- provide for the efficient sharing of information concerning education of students with visual impairments.

> **Technical** \- provide resources for professionals, parents, and lay persons associated with programs for the visually impaired and deaf/blind throughout the state, country, and world

All resources on the TSBVI Web page are in the public domain unless otherwise noted. You are welcome to use these resources as needed provided that the TSBVI Web page is cited as the source. A basic tenet of TSBVI is to promote the collegial sharing of information. You are invited to submit items for publication on the website. In all cases author contact information will be included. In this manner, we hope to build a valuable resource to promote the development of instructional materials and resources.

### Web Site Usability Features
