<h1><a name="top">About</a> the TSBVI Web Site</h1>
<p>This page and the entire TSBVI World Wide Web site strives to be accessible
  to all people.</p>
<h3><a name="Purpose">Purpose</a></h3>
<p>The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired World Wide Web site reflects
  the schools vision of serving as a leading center of educational expertise
  for students with visual impairments. The TSBVI website strives to be a model
  for web site design to ensure the information is accessible to individuals
  with visual impairments. Such information can be easily transformed into Braille,
  large print, voice output, and regular text. As a technical information resource,
  the site will focus on four areas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Training </strong>- materials to support training and education,
    announcements of upcoming training events, and provision of on-line training</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Research</strong> - provide for the ongoing development and dissemination
    of research information developed here at TSBVI, within the State of Texas,
    and elsewhere. It is our hope that such information will coordinate the efforts
    of professionals working in the classroom, educational center, and academic
    context</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Curricula</strong> - provide for the efficient sharing of information
    concerning education of students with visual impairments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Technical</strong> - provide resources for professionals, parents,
    and lay persons associated with programs for the visually impaired and deaf/blind
    throughout the state, country, and world</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All resources on the TSBVI Web page are in the public domain unless otherwise
  noted. You are welcome to use these resources as needed provided that the TSBVI
  Web page is cited as the source. A basic tenet of TSBVI is to promote the collegial
  sharing of information. You are invited to submit items for publication on
  the website. In all cases author contact information will be included. In this
  manner, we hope to build a valuable resource to promote the development of
  instructional materials and resources.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer of Endorsement</h2>

      <p> The TSBVI website contains a variety of links and references to resources available through government, educational, commercial,  nonprofit, and international websites. External links to websites from the TSBVI website and  references to non-TSBVI resources are provided solely for  informational purposes and the convenience of the user.

<h3><a name="Web">Accessibility</a> Policy</h3>
<p>The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (TSBVI) is committed
    to making its Web site accessible to all users. To make the site more accessible,
    we include several features designed to improve accessibility for users with
    disabilities. Some of these features are described below.</p>
<p>A descriptive text equivalent is provided for images and other non-text elements,
    aiding users who listen to the content of the site by using a screen reader,
    rather than reading the site.</p>
<p>Major reports and other publications that are on the Web site are generally
    available in HTML or other accessible format. When publishing a document
    in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), we will also post an accessible
    version.</p>
<p>TSBVI is committed to making its Web site accessible according to the standards
    set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT">Web
    Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> and the  <a href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=12#Web">Section
    508 Web Accessibility Standards.</a> To improve the accessibility
    of our Web site, we test any major redesign with screen readers and other
    tools. The results of these reviews are incorporated into the Web site.</p>
<p>TSBVI welcomes comments on how to improve the site's accessibility for users
    with disabilities. If you use assistive technology and the format of any
    material on our Web site interferes with your ability to access the information,
    please <a href="mailto:jimallan@tsbvi.edu">contact the webmaster</a>. To enable us to respond in a manner most helpful
    to you, please indicate the nature of your accessibility problem, the preferred
    format in which to receive the material, the Web address of the requested
    material, and your contact information.    </p>
<p>Additional information about accessibility programs in Texas is available
    from the <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/disabilities">Governor's
    Committee on People with Disabilities</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a visual impairment there are many options which you can control
    from the selection of an accessible browser to modifying your browser to
    meet your needs. Visit <a href="technology/web.htm">Large Print and Speech Access
