# Privacy Statements

### Introduction

This Arizona State University ( **ASU** ) Privacy Statement provides information required by Arizona law about ASU’s online information gathering and dissemination practices. Individual pages on ASU websites may provide additional information. 

In addition to the information in this Privacy Statement, [ASU’s Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/tou/) and [Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications Information Management Policy](https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html) set forth requirements that you must follow when using ASU’s websites and technology network. 

If you are in the European Union, please also review ASU’s Supplemental Privacy Provisions for Persons in the European Union. These EU Supplemental Privacy Provisions provide additional information regarding ASU’s processing of personal data you submit or disclose to ASU (or to a third party that transfers it to ASU for processing) while you are in the European Union.

We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement because we may update it from time to time. 

### What Services ASU Provides Online

ASU’s websites provide online information and services to all users of ASU’s technology network ( **Users** ) consistent with [ASU’s Charter and Mission](https://president.asu.edu/about/asucharter). 

In addition to information and services provided on ASU websites, ASU may also provide connections to external services and information provided by non-ASU service providers. These non-ASU provided services may include the education versions of Dropbox, Amazon Web Services, and Google, which includes Gmail. Non-ASU service providers have their own privacy policies that are not covered by this Privacy Statement. ASU is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of non-ASU service providers. We recommend you review the privacy practices and policies of all non-ASU service providers.

### Information ASU Collects from Users and How We Use it

ASU collects information actively provided by Users. We may also collect information about the computers, mobile devices, or other devices you use to access ASU’s technology network, such as IP address, unique device identifiers, browser types, browser languages, web pages requested, network software access, referring web pages, date, time, and duration of activity, passwords, and accounts accessed, volume of data storage and transfers, and locations of User devices when connected to ASU’s technology network. Logs of this information may be retained. We may contract with non-ASU service providers to help us better understand Users. These non-ASU service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our services.

Cookies are small files that are stored on your computing devices.

Cookies may be set by an organization other than ASU. These non-ASU cookies may, for example, originate from social media services such as YouTube and Facebook. Because the cookie policies of these services change over time, you should review their policies by visiting the privacy policies of these services directly. Users may disable cookies through their individual browser options. 

ASU uses information collected to provide services, in support of ASU’s Charter and Mission, to protect the security of ASU’s technology network, to support academic integrity, and to provide safety and security services to Users, as well as to monitor, preserve, and enhance the use, functioning, and integrity of ASU’s technology network.

ASU requires non-ASU service providers to protect personal information on our behalf. 

ASU does not allow any non-ASU entities to collect information from ASU’s technology network unless those entities have received written permission from an ASU authorized signatory.

### Security

ASU takes steps to ensure that confidential information collected online is secure. These steps include: ongoing User education; using tools in an effort to restrict unauthorized access, viruses, phishing, and hacking attempts; and monitoring activity to identify potential system threats.

ASU may use the details you provide on your application, together with any supporting documents you submit, additional details and documents provided by any references or third parties, including education records and financial aid applications and records, and any records made by ASU during the application process.

In addition to the uses described in Part B above, we will process the EU Personal Data obtained during your application process for the purposes of identifying you, processing your application, verifying the information provided, deciding whether to offer you admission, and communicating that outcome. We may also use or disclose this information for the following statutory or public interest purposes: to prevent or detect fraud; for disciplinary or academic integrity proceedings; to meet reporting obligations, such as to state or federal Departments of Education; to help us to make reasonable decisions regarding accommodations for a disability, as requested by you; and for research and statistical purposes, but none of your EU Personal Data that can identify you will be published.

We consider the Processing of your EU Personal Data in connection with your student application process to be necessary for us to take steps with a view to creating a contractual relationship with you (e.g., to assess your application to study with us), necessary for compliance with a legal obligation, or necessary for the performance of tasks we carry out in the public interest (e.g., admissions research). We require you to provide ASU the information we request during the application process to assess your application properly.

As well as circulating your application and related materials to the appropriate people at ASU, we may share your EU Personal Data, as relevant and necessary, with your references, with entities that provide services to, or on behalf of, ASU, and with governmental organizations. If you are accepted, ASU will include in your ASU student files the EU Personal Data collected during your application process.

**ASU Service Providers.** ASU may contract with non-ASU service providers, vendors, and contractors ( **Contractors** ) to assist ASU in providing services.
