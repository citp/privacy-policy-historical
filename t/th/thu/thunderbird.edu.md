# Privacy Statements

### Introduction

This Arizona State University ( **ASU** ) Privacy Statement provides information required by Arizona law about ASU’s online information gathering and dissemination practices. Individual pages on ASU websites may provide additional information. 

In addition to the information in this Privacy Statement, [ASU’s Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/tou/) and [Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications Information Management Policy](https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd125.html) set forth requirements that you must follow when using ASU’s websites and technology network. 

We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement because we may update it from time to time. 

### What Services ASU Provides Online

In addition to information and services provided on ASU websites, ASU may also provide connections to external services and information provided by non-ASU service providers. These non-ASU provided services may include the education versions of Dropbox, Amazon Web Services, and Google, which includes Gmail. Non-ASU service providers have their own privacy policies that are not covered by this Privacy Statement. ASU is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of non-ASU service providers. We recommend you review the privacy practices and policies of all non-ASU service providers.
