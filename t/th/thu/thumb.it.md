# Thumb - Privacy Policy

#### THUMB'S PRIVACY STATEMENT

Welcome to Thumb! Thumb, Inc. (“ **Thumb** ,” “ **Opinionaided** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” or “ **our** ”) operates this website ( **thumb.it** ) (the “ **Site** ”) as well as a number of related services, including our mobile applications (collectively, the “ **Services** ”). The focus of our Site and Service is to let You get opinions, give opinions, communicate with other users, and connect with people like you.

Privacy is of great importance to us whether You are a “ **Visitor** ” (which means that you simply browse the Site (defined below)) or a “ **Member** ” of Thumb (which means you have either registered with Thumb or established an account). Visitors and Members are individually referred to as a “ **User** ,” and collectively, as “ **Users** ” Because we gather important information from our Users, we have established this Privacy Statement as a means to communicate our information collection, use and dissemination practices.

So we are clear on the terminology we use, “ **Personal Information** ” means contact information (e.g., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information. “ **Anonymous Information** ” means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual.

**BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.**

**Children.** The Site and Services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to prevent the User from utilizing the Site and the Services.

**Collected Information** In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you and helps us learn more about the use of the Site and/or Services. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily at registration and in the course of using the Site and/or Services, including the questions and opinions you post on the Site or through the Services. To use the Services you must create an “ **Account** ” by providing your name, email address, gender, age, location, additional preferences, a password, and potentially additional information. You may alternatively connect to the Site or Services through Facebook, in which case we may collect that information (less the password but including a photograph), from Facebook for the purposes of creating your Account on the Site. When you communicate with us by sending us an email, we will collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us.

When you register, we will create a profile for you that includes your first name and first letter of your last name and any other information you want to provide, including, but not limited to, your gender, location, relationship status, your bio and a profile picture. We may collect information about your location in a variety of ways, including through Facebook and through functionality enabled in native mobile applications. If you registered through Facebook, we may use the information we collected about you from Facebook to pre-populate your Profile. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but the Services have more relevancy when you provide this information, and you may be able to make more meaningful connections.

We will refer to all of the information contained in your Profile as your “ **Profile Information** ”. As your Profile Information is intended by you to be published on the Site, your Profile Information will not be considered Personal Information under this Agreement, even if it contains Personal Information and we may use and disclose the Profile Information on the Site without restriction.

We will refer to the questions asked through the Site and Services as "Questions" and responses to Questions as "Responses".

If you access the Services from your mobile device, we will collect your unique device identifier, the application version you are using, and your event activity.

If you choose to use our “Refer to a Friend” feature, we will ask for your friends email address. We will send your friend a one time email inviting them to visit the site. We do not store this information or use it for any other purpose other than to fulfill send the email at your request.

If you make a purchase through the Services, we collect information about the purchase including the specific goods or services you have purchased, the date you made the purchase and the fees paid. We let you know, however, that we do NOT have access to your billing information, such as your credit card number and credit card expiration date, which is collected directly by the payment processor and governed by the payment processor’s privacy policy and not ours (e.g., the privacy policy of the Apple Store if you purchase the Services on your iPhone).

In order to provide this authorization, You will not provide us with Your user name or password to the SN Site, but You will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site. Once authorized by You, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to recognize us when we ask, on Your behalf, for access to Your account information or to post information.
