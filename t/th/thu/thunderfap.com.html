For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(a)Traffic Data.</strong> Like most website operators, ThunderFap.com automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the Website; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the Website (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify You.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(b)Cookies.</strong> A “Cookie” is a string of information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the Website. ThunderFap.com uses Cookies to customize Your experience on the Website to Your interests, to ensure that You do not see the same advertisements or informational messages repeatedly, and to store Your password so You do not have to re-enter it each time You visit the Website. For additional information on ThunderFap.com’s uses of Cookies, see the section concerning Information Use and Disclosure Practices/Traffic Data and Information Gathered Using Cookies, below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
