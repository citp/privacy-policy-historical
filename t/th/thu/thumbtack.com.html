                We collect personal information from service professionals offering their products

                <em>Consumers:</em> During the Account registration process, we will collect
                information such as your name, zip code, and email address. You also may provide us
                with your telephone number, mailing address, and demographic information (e.g.,
                gender, age, political preference, education, race or ethnic origin, and other
                information relevant to user surveys and/or offers). We may also collect personal

                <em>Cookies.</em> We and our third party service providers collect information from

                containing information about the user. The cookie helps us analyze web traffic or
                informs you about your use of a particular website. Cookies allow web applications
                to respond to you as an individual, tailoring its operations to your needs, likes
                and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. When
                you visit the Website, we may send one or more cookies (i.e., a small text file

                Some of these cookies may be connected to third-party companies or websites.
                The terms of use of such cookies are governed by this Policy and the privacy
                policy of the relevant thirdparty company or website. For example, Google

                <em>Disabling Cookies.</em> You can choose to accept or decline cookies.
                Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify
                your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable
                cookies you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Website
                because it may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is
                disabled.

                <em>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</em> Clear GIFs are tiny
                graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In
                contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear

                Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic
                measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including

                specific privacy policy, not this one.  We may provide these third-party

                You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by
                members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and the Digital
                Advertising Alliance ("DAA"). For more information regarding this practice
                by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this
                information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of thirdparty
                ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective
                websites:
                    <a href="www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonpii.asp">
                        www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI)

                <br>
                <br>

                Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which
                will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver
                targeted content or ads to you.  It does not mean you will no longer receive
                any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue
                to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that
                you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies
                when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies,
                use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may
                no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI's and
                DAA's websites accessible by the above links.
