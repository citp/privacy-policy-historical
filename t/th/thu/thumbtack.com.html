            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p><em>Last Updated: October 24, 2016</em></p>

            <p>Thumbtack, Inc. ("Thumbtack," "we," "our," or "us") values your
              privacy. In this Privacy Policy ("Policy"), we describe the information we collect, how
              we use it, and when and with whom we share it. This Policy applies to all sites, mobile
              applications, and other online services (collectively, "Platform") made available by
              Thumbtack. This Policy applies only to information collected on or through the
              Platform. It does not apply to information collected or obtained by or through any
              other means (including, without limitation, information collected offline, in person,
              over the telephone and/or by mail, or from third parties outside the Platform).
              Undefined capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions as set forth in
              our <a href="http://www.thumbtack.com/terms">
                        Terms of Use</a>. By accessing or using the Platform, you
              agree to this Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY,
              PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM.</p>

            <h3>KEY TERMS</h3>

            <p>Please review the <a href="/terms/#key-terms">"Key Terms" section in the Terms of Use</a>.</p>

            <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

            <p>How we collect and store information depends on how you access
              and use the Platform. We collect information in multiple ways including when you
              provide information directly to us, when you permit third parties to provide
              information to us, and when we passively collect information from you, such as
              information collected from your browser or device.</p>

            <p class="c2 c6"><em>Information You Provide Directly to Us</em></p>

            <p>We may collect information from you during your use or access of
              the Platform, such as:</p>

            <ul class="c4 lst-kix_an48178t9320-0 start">
                <li>When you register for an Account;</li>
                <li>When you participate in polls or surveys;</li>
                <li>When you enroll for electronic newsletters;</li>
                <li>When you request a quote or other information;</li>
                <li>When you submit or respond to a quote;</li>
                <li>When you make a purchase;</li>
                <li>When you fill out any forms;</li>
                <li>When you enter a sweepstakes or contest, or register for a
                promotion;</li>
                <li>When you transmit User Content;</li>
                <li>When you download or use one of our mobile applications;
                or</li>
                <li>When you otherwise communicate with us or other users through
                the Platform.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; the
              Privacy Policy applies to <em>all</em> use
              of the Platform.</p>
            <p>The information you provide directly to us may concern you or
              others and may include, but is not limited to: (a) name; (b) zip code; (c) email
              address; (d) home or business telephone number; (e) home, business or mailing address;
              (f) demographic information (e.g., gender, age, political preference,
              education, race or ethnic origin, and other information relevant to user surveys and/or
              offers); (g) date of birth; (h) insurance information; (i) photographs;
              (j) information about your project, request or need; (k) video or audio files;
              (l) in certain circumstances, payment and/or identity verification information. and/or
              (m) any other content you include in private communications with other users through
              the Platform or communications with us. It may
              also include information specific to services you are requesting or offering through
              the Platform, such as a business name, service description, qualifications and
              credentials. You are not required to provide us with such information, but certain
              features of the Platform may not be accessible or available, absent the provision of
              the requested information.</p>

            <p><em>Information from Affiliates, Social Networking
              Sites, and other Non-affiliated Third Parties</em></p>

            <p>We may collect information about you or others through Thumbtack
              affiliates or through non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to
              access the Platform through a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you
              access the Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to
              certain information in your Facebook profile. This may include your name, profile
              picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email
              address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or
              "likes." </p>

            <p>Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have their own policies
              for handling your information. For a description of how these sites may use and
              disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the
              sites' privacy policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or
              discloses the personal information it collects about you.</p>

            <p>We may also collect information about you or others through
              non-affiliated third parties. For example, to the extent permitted by law, we may, in
              our sole discretion, ask for and collect supplemental information from third parties,
              such as information about your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify
              your identity or trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes. We
              may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with information
              that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other products
              or services we provide.</p>

            <p><em>Information That is Passively or Automatically
              Collected</em></p>

            <p><em>Device/Usage Information.</em> We and our
              third-party service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies
              including DoubleClick and Google Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other
              tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including
              mobile devices) you use to access the Platform. As described further below, we may
              collect and analyze information including but not limited to (a) browser type; (b) ISP
              or operating system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e) referring or exit pages; (f)
              page views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or Android ID);
              and (i) the type of device that you use. We may also track how frequently you access or
              use the Platform. We use this information (including the information collected by our
              third-party service providers) for Platform analytics (including to
              determine which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what
              our users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and
              off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as
              otherwise described in this Policy.</p>

            <p><em>Location Information.</em> When you use the
              Platform, we may collect general location information (such as IP address). If you
              install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's
              geolocation data. If you grant such permission, we may collect information about your
              precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the Platform, including
              providing you with location-based features (e.g. for identification of Pro Services
              available near you). To deliver customized content and advertising, we may share your
              location information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the
              Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with
              location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking
              functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device
              manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you
              disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the
              Platform.</p>

            <p><em>Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies.</em>
              We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags,
              and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, personalize
              preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform. These
              technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your
              password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage
              content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We also use certain of these
              technologies to deliver advertisements through the Platform that may interest you. We
              or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in
              emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails
              are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>

            <p>We may also use local shared objects (also known as "Flash
              cookies") to assist in delivering special content, such as video clips or animation.
              Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are not managed through your web
              browser. To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe
              website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.</p>

            <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
              automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser
              settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented
              from taking full advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly. Flash
              cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available
              in a web browser may not affect flash cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we
              may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>

            <p>We may combine information that we collect from you through the
              Platform with information that we obtain from affiliated and nonaffiliated third
              parties, and information derived from any other products or services we
              provide.</p>

            <p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through
              the Platform. We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including
              without limitation for research and marketing purposes and may also share such data
              with any third parties, including without limitation, advertisers, promotional
              partners, sponsors, event promoters, and/or others.</p>

            <p>We may, either directly or through third parties we engage to
                provide services to us, review, scan, or analyze your communications
                with other users exchanged via the Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment,
                regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and customer
                support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts,
                we may scan and analyze messages to prevent fraud or improper actions.
                We may also scan, review or analyze messages for research and product development
                purposes, as well as to debug, improve and expand product offerings. By using the
                Platform, you consent that Thumbtack, in its sole discretion, may, either directly
                or through third parties we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, analyze, and
                store your communications, whether done manually or through automated means.</p>

            <h3>WHEN THUMBTACK DISCLOSES YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>Unless otherwise described in this Policy, we may also share the
              information that we collect from you through the Platform as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><em>Affiliates.</em> We may share your
                information with any Thumbtack affiliates.</li>
                <li><em>Consent.</em> We may disclose your
                information to nonaffiliated third parties based on
                your consent to do so. Such consent includes the disclosure of your information (a)
                in order to provide services or products that you have requested (please see below
                for more details); (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as described in this
                Policy, the Terms of Use, or any other legal terms governing your use of the
                Platform.</li>
                <li><em>Service Providers</em>. We may provide
                access to your information to select third parties who
                perform services on our behalf. These third parties provide a variety of services to
                us including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market
                research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, identity verification,
                fraud and safety protection and legal services. As we retain new service
                providers, we generally seek contractual assurances from these service providers that
                they will not use your information in any manner other than to help us provide you
                with the services and products available from Thumbtack.</li>
                <li><em>Legal Requirements</em>. We may disclose
                your information when required by law or when we believe in good faith
                that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with subpoenas, court orders, or
                other legal process we receive; (b) establish or exercise our legal rights including
                enforcing and administering agreements with users; or
                    (c)defend Thumbtack against legal
                claims.If we are required by law to disclose your
                information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you unless
                (a) we believe in our sole discretion that providing notice could create a risk of
                injury or death, or that harm or fraud could be directed to Thumbtack or users; or
                (b) we are precluded from providing notice by law. We will attempt to provide the
                notice by email if you have given us an email address. If you do not challenge the disclosure
                request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.</li>

                <li><em>Protection of Thumbtack and Others</em>.
                We may disclose your information when we believe it appropriate to investigate,
                prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud,
                situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,
                violations of the Terms of Use or any other legal
                terms governing use of the Platform, and/or to protect our rights and property and
                the rights and property of other users.</li>

                <li><em>Business Transfers</em>. As we continue
                to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or
                businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions or where there is
                any change of control of Thumbtack, user information may be among the transferred
                assets.</li>

                <li><em>App Store Providers</em>. We may provide
                your identity and mobile device identifier to third-party app store providers (for
                example, the Apple App Store) to allow you to download our mobile apps.</li>

                <li><em>Academics and Research</em>. We may
                provide information about users to third parties for academic and research purposes,
                in anonymized or aggregated form.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please be advised that some information you provide will be
              publicly accessible. For instance, registration for an Account requires that you
              provide us with your name. If you register through Facebook, the Platform will use the
              name associated with your Facebook account. Your name (full name, or in
              some instances, your first name and last initial) may be visible to other users.
              Depending on the circumstances, your name may be
              attached to your Content or information, such as scheduling of Pro Services, service
              requests, reviews, participating in discussions or forums, messaging, and profile
              information. Certain other people, including other users with whom you have interacted
              via the Platform, will see information about you that is attached to your name. For
              example (but without limitation), if you are a Customer Member seeking Pro Services, the
              description you provide of your desired services, along with your name, will be
              shown to some Pro Members
              registered in the relevant category along with your name. Thus, other users may be able
              to personally identify you based on Content you provide.</p>

            <p>We invite you to post Content on or through our Platform, including,
                but not limited to, your comments,pictures, and any other information. However, please
                be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you choose to post User Content
                on or through the Platform, such as through Member-to-Member messaging or through our
                review boards, forums, blogs, or other postings, that information: (a) may be or may
                become publicly available; (b) may be collected and used by third parties without
                our knowledge; and (c) may be used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law,
                or your personal privacy.</p>

            <h3>ONLINE ANALYTICS AND TAILORED ADVERTISING</h3>

            <p><em>Analytics</em></p>

            <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on the Platform, such
              as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology
              described in the Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected section above
              to help us analyze how users use the Platform, including by noting the third-party
              website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be
              disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information
              to evaluate your use of the Platform. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes
              related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google
              Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the
              <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">
                      Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

            <p><em>Tailored Advertising</em></p>

            <p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed
              via the Platform may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your
              computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of
              the Platform in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on
              past visits to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content
              impressions, other uses of marketing services, and interactions with these marketing
              impressions and marketing services are related to visits to our websites. We also allow
              other third parties(e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google
              Analytics, DoubleClick, Facebook and others) to serve tailored marketing
              to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer,
              mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform. We neither have access
              to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that
              may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the
              Platform by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any
              other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer
              you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive
              tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated
              with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted
              to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed,
              non-human-readable form.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in more information about tailored browser
              advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer
              to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the <a class="c0" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">
                        Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out
                        Link</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">
                        Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Link</a> to
              opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those
              programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google
              Display Network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">
                        Google Ads Settings page</a>. Please note that to the extent advertising
              technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still receive advertising content
              even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will
              just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above
              opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms
              or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are
              configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently
              erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers,
              your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.
              Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites, accessible by the above
              links.</p>

            <p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored
              in-application advertising content. Each operating system-iOS for Apple devices,
              Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices-provides its own
              instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing
              content. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the
              respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application
              advertising. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy
              settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform
              operator.</p>

            <h3>CALIFORNIA DO-NOT-TRACK DISCLOSURE</h3>

            <p>Thumbtack is committed to providing you with meaningful choices
                about the information collected on our Platform for third party purposes. That is why
                we have provided links (above) to the NAI "Consumer Opt-Out" link, the DAA opt-out link,
                and a Google opt-out link. However, Thumbtack does not currently recognize or respond to
                browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working
                on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.</p>

            <h3>PRIVACY OF MINORS</h3>

            <p>Our Services are not designed for minors under 18. Only persons 18 years of age or older
                may use the Platform. If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided us with personal
                information, we will close the account and delete the personal information to the extent
                required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We may, where permitted by law,
                retain certain information internally for purposes described in this Policy.</p>

            <h3>SECURITY</h3>

            <p>We employ appropriate physical, procedural and technological security measures, which
                are reasonably designed to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access
                or disclosure. Thumbtack may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to
                help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No
                security measures, however, are 100% failsafe. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot
                guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private
                communications will not be collected, disclosed and/or used by others. You should take
                steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among
                other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password
                that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password private, and
                not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts. Thumbtack is not responsible for
                the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords,
                or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.</p>

            <h3>LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS</h3>

            <p>The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over
                which Thumbtack does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement
                by Thumbtack of those external websites. You acknowledge that Thumbtack is providing
                these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Thumbtack is not
                responsible for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of
                information you provide while visiting such external websites.</p>

            <h3>UPDATING, DELETING, AND CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>You may review, correct and delete certain information about you by
                logging in to the Platform and navigating to your preferences page in "Your Dashboard."
                You must promptly update your Account information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon
                your request, we will close your Account and remove your profile information from view
                as soon as reasonably possible. We may retain information from closed Accounts in order
                to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,
                troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any user, enforce our Terms of
                Use, and/or for any other purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in
                our sole discretion. You should understand, however, that once you transmit User
                Content through the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have
                deactivated or removed your Account, you agree that Thumbtack will not be responsible to
                you for retaining information related to your Account.</p>

            <h3>YOUR
                CHOICES REGARDING EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS</h3>

            <p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you.
                You may opt out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained
                in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process
                opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other
                information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your Account
                or any services you have requested or received from us.</p>

            <h3>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>

            <p>THIS POLICY IS CURRENT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE SET FORTH ABOVE.
                THUMBTACK MAY, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, CHANGE THIS POLICY AT ANY TIME.
                THUMBTACK WILL POST ITS UPDATED POLICY ON THE PLATFORM, SEND YOU A MESSAGE OR OTHERWISE
                NOTIFY YOU WHEN YOU ARE LOGGED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT IN ADVANCE OF THE NEW EFFECTIVE DATE.
                THUMBTACK ENCOURAGES YOU TO REVIEW THIS POLICY REGULARLY FOR ANY CHANGES. YOUR CONTINUED
                ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PLATFORM WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE THEN-CURRENT POLICY.</p>

            <h3>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</h3>

            <p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so
                your personal data will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection
                and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of
                the world, such as the European Union. If you create an Account with the Platform as a
                visitor from outside the United States, by using the Platform, you agree to this Policy
                and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may
                not offer a level of protection equivalent to that required in the European Union or
                certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this
                Policy.</p>
