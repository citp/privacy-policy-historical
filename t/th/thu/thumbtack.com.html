            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p><em>Last Updated: November 1, 2018</em></p>

            <p>Thumbtack, Inc. ("Thumbtack," "we," "our," or "us") values your privacy.
                In this Privacy Policy ("Policy"), we describe the information we collect,
                how we use it, and when and with whom we share it. This Policy applies to all sites,
                mobile applications, and other online services (collectively, "Platform") made
                available by Thumbtack. This Policy applies only to information collected on or
                through the Platform. It does not apply to information collected or obtained by or
                through any other means (including, without limitation, information collected offline,
                in person, over the telephone and/or by mail, or from third parties outside the Platform).
                Undefined capitalized terms used herein shall have the definitions as set forth in our
                <a href="http://www.thumbtack.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
                By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to this Policy.
                IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM.</p>

            <h3>KEY TERMS</h3>

            <p>Please review the <a href="/terms/#key-terms">"Key Terms" section in the Terms of Use</a>.</p>

            <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

            <p>How we collect and store information depends on how you access and use the Platform.
                We collect information in multiple ways including when you provide information
                directly to us, when you permit third parties to provide information to us, and when
                we passively collect information from you, such as information collected from your
                browser or device.</p>

            <p><em>Information You Provide Directly to Us</em></p>

            <p>We may collect information from you during your use or access of
                the Platform, such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>When you register for an Account;</li>
                <li>When you participate in polls or surveys;</li>
                <li>When you enroll for electronic newsletters;</li>
                <li>When you request a quote or other information;</li>
                <li>When you submit or respond to a quote;</li>
                <li>When you make a purchase;</li>
                <li>When you fill out any forms;</li>
                <li>When you enter a sweepstakes or contest, or register for a
                    promotion;</li>
                <li>When you transmit User Content;</li>
                <li>When you download or use one of our mobile applications;
                    or</li>
                <li>When you otherwise communicate with us or other users through
                    the Platform.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; the
                Privacy Policy applies to <em>all</em> use
                of the Platform.</p>
            <p>The information you provide directly to us may concern you or others and may include,
                but is not limited to: (a) name; (b) zip code; (c) email address; (d) home or
                business telephone number; (e) home, business or mailing address; (f) demographic
                information (e.g., gender, age, political preference, education, race or ethnic
                origin, and other information relevant to user surveys and/or offers); (g) date of
                birth; (h) insurance information; (i) photographs; (j) information about your
                project, request or need; (k) video or audio files; (l) in certain circumstances,
                payment and/or identity verification information; and/or (m) any other content you
                include in communications with other users through the Platform or communications
                with us. It may also include information specific to services you are requesting or
                offering through the Platform, such as a business name, service description,
                qualifications and credentials. You are not required to provide us with such
                information, but certain features of the Platform may not be accessible or available,
                absent the provision of the requested information.</p>

            <p><em>Information from Affiliates, Social Networking
                    Sites, and other Non-affiliated Third Parties</em></p>

            <p>We may collect information about you or others through Thumbtack affiliates or
                through non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to access the
                Platform through a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you access the
                Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to certain
                information in your Facebook profile. This may include your name, profile picture,
                gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email address,
                photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or "likes."</p>

            <p>Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have their own policies for handling your
                information. For a description of how these sites may use and disclose your
                information, including any information you make public, please consult the sites'
                privacy policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses
                the personal information it collects about you.</p>

            <p>We may collect information about you or others through non-affiliated third parties.
                For example, to the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask for
                and collect supplemental information from third parties, such as information about
                your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify your identity or
                trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes. We may combine
                information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we
                obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other products or
                services we provide.</p>

            <p>Through non-affiliated third parties, we may also collect information that
                demonstrates the occurrence of an off-Platform communication between a Customer
                Member and a Service Member in order to ensure accurate charging of fees imposed
                upon Service Members and to enforce the Terms of Use.  Except as explicitly stated
                herein, we will not collect or store the contents of any off-Platform communication
                between a Customer Member and a Service Member.</p>

            <p>If you send text messages with a Customer Member or Service Member using the
                telephone number for that Member available on the Platform, we may use a third-party
                service provider to track these text messages. We track these text messages for
                fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of Fees, to enforce these Terms,
                and for quality and training purposes. As part of this process, Thumbtack and its
                service provider will receive in real time and store data about your text message,
                including the date and time of the text message, your phone number, and the content
                of the text message.</p>

            <p><em>Information That is Passively or Automatically Collected</em></p>

            <p><em>Device/Usage Information.</em> We and our third-party service providers, which
                include ad networks and analytics companies including DoubleClick and Google
                Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect
                information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to
                access the Platform. As described further below, we may collect and analyze
                information including but not limited to (a) browser type; (b) ISP or operating
                system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e) referring or exit pages; (f) page
                views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or Android ID); and
                (i) the type of device that you use. We may also track when and how frequently you
                access or use the Platform. We use this information (including the information
                collected by our third-party service providers) for Platform analytics (including
                to determine which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what our
                users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and
                off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as
                otherwise described in this Policy.</p>

            <p><em>Location Information.</em> When you use the Platform, we may collect general
                location information (such as IP address). If you install our mobile app, we may
                ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's geolocation data. If you grant
                such permission, we may collect information about your precise geolocation, and we
                may use that information to improve the Platform, including providing you with
                location-based features (e.g. for identification of Pro Services available near you).
                To deliver customized content and advertising, we may share your location
                information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the Platform
                through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with
                location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking
                functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your
                device manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you disable certain
                functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform.</p>

            <p><em>Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies.</em> We and our third-party service
                providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help
                us better understand user behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and
                analytics, and improve the Platform. These technologies, for example, may allow us
                to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas,
                track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about
                Platform usage. We also use certain of these technologies to deliver advertisements
                through the Platform that may interest you. We or our third-party service providers
                also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our customers to help us
                track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether
                our emails are forwarded.</p>

            <p>We may also use local shared objects (also known as "Flash cookies") to assist in
                delivering special content, such as video clips or animation. Flash cookies are
                stored on your device, but they are not managed through your web browser. To learn
                more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make
                changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.</p>

            <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
                cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline
                cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full
                advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly. Flash cookies
                operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available
                in a web browser may not affect flash cookies. As we adopt additional technologies,
                we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>

            </ul>

            <p>We may display information related to your business, including your name or your
                business’s name, publicly on your profile, except to the extent we tell you we will
                not display such information. If the information you provide us upon signing up for
                an account differs from the information you provide us as part of the verification
                data we collect, we have sole discretion in determining which information will be
                displayed publicly on your profile. </p>

            <p>We may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with
                information that we obtain from affiliated and nonaffiliated third parties, and
                information derived from any other products or services we provide.</p>

            <p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Platform.
                We may use de-identified or aggregated data for any purpose, including without
                limitation for research and marketing purposes and may also share such data with
                any third parties, including without limitation, advertisers, promotional partners,
                sponsors, event promoters, and/or others.</p>

            <p>We may, either directly or through third parties we engage to provide services
                to us, review, scan, or analyze your communications with other users exchanged via
                the Platform or as otherwise described in this Policy for fraud prevention, risk
                assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and
                customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we
                may scan and analyze messages to prevent fraud or improper actions. We may also scan,
                review or analyze messages for research and product development purposes, as well
                as to debug, improve and expand product offerings. By using the Platform or engaging
                in off-Platform communications tracked by Thumbtack, you consent that Thumbtack, in
                its sole discretion, may, either directly or through third parties we engage to
                provide services to us, review, scan, analyze, and store your communications, whether
                done manually or through automated means.</p>

            <h3>WHEN THUMBTACK DISCLOSES YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>Unless otherwise described in this Policy, we may also share the
                information that we collect from you through the Platform as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><em>Affiliates</em>. We may share your information with any Thumbtack affiliates.</li>
                <li><em>Consent</em>. We may disclose your information to nonaffiliated third parties
                    based on your consent to do so. Such consent includes the disclosure of your
                    information (a) in order to provide services or products that you have requested
                    (please see below for more details); (b) when we have your permission; or (c)
                    as described in this Policy, the Terms of Use, or any other legal terms governing
                    your use of the Platform.</li>
                <li><em>Service Providers</em>. We may provide access to your information to select
                    third parties who perform services on our behalf. These third parties provide a
                    variety of services to us including without limitation billing, sales, marketing,
                    advertising, market research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing,
                    identity verification, fraud and safety protection and legal services. As we
                    retain new service providers, we generally seek contractual assurances from
                    these service providers that they will not use your information in any manner
                    other than to help us provide you with the services and products available from
                    Thumbtack.</li>
                <li><em>Legal Requirements</em>. We may disclose your information when required by
                    law or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a)
                    comply with subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process we receive; (b)
                    establish or exercise our legal rights including enforcing and administering
                    agreements with users; or (c) defend Thumbtack against legal claims. If we are
                    required by law to disclose your information, we will use commercially reasonable
                    efforts to notify you unless (1) we believe in our sole discretion that providing
                    notice could create a risk of injury or death, or that harm or fraud could be
                    directed to Thumbtack or users; or (2) we are precluded from providing notice
                    by law. We will attempt to provide the notice by email if you have given us an
                    email address. While you may challenge the disclosure request, please be advised
                    we may still be legally required to turn over your information.</li>
                <li><em>Protection of Thumbtack and Others</em>. We may disclose your information
                    to whomever necessary when we believe it appropriate to investigate, prevent,
                    or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
                    involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of
                    the Terms of Use or any other legal terms governing use of the Platform, and/or
                    to protect our rights and property and the rights and property of other users.</li>
                <li><em>Business Transfers</em>. As we continue to develop our business, we may sell,
                    buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of
                    our assets. In such contemplated or actual transactions or where there is any
                    change of control of Thumbtack, user information may be among the shared and/or
                    transferred assets.</li>
                <li><em>App Store Providers</em>. We may provide your identity and mobile device
                    identifier to third-party app store providers (for example, the Apple App Store)
                    to allow you to download our mobile apps.</li>
                <li><em>Academics and Research</em>. We may provide information about users to third
                    parties for academic and research purposes, in anonymized or aggregated form.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please be advised that some information you provide and/or that we collect will be
                publicly accessible. For instance, registration for an Account requires that you
                provide us with your name. If you register through Facebook, the Platform will
                use the name associated with your Facebook account. Your name (full name, or in some
                instances, your first name and last initial) may be visible to other users.
                Depending on the circumstances, your name may be attached to your Content or
                information, such as scheduling of Pro Services, service requests, reviews,
                participating in discussions or forums, messaging, and profile information. Certain
                other people, including other users with whom you have interacted via the Platform,
                will see information about you that is attached to your name. For example (but without
                limitation), if you are a Customer Member seeking Pro Services, the description you
                provide of your desired services, along with your name, will be shown to some Pro
                Members registered in the relevant category along with your name. Thus, other users
                may be able to personally identify you based on Content you provide. Similarly, the
                information we collect, including but not limited to when you last accessed the
                Platform, may be shared with other Members with whom you are interacting or otherwise
                made public.</p>
            <p>We invite you to post Content on or through our Platform, including, but not limited
                to, your comments, pictures, Service Member profile, and any other information.
                However, please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you choose
                to post User Content on or through the Platform, such as through Member-to-Member
                messaging or through our review boards, forums, blogs, or other postings, that
                information: (a) may be or may become publicly available; (b) may be collected and
                used by third parties with or without our knowledge; and (c) may be used in a manner
                that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy.</p>

            <h3>ONLINE ANALYTICS AND TAILORED ADVERTISING</h3>

            <p><em>Analytics</em></p>

            <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on the Platform, such as those of
                Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described
                in the Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected section above to
                help us analyze how users use the Platform, including by noting the third-party
                website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be
                disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information
                to evaluate your use of the Platform. We also use Google Analytics for certain
                purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent
                Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the
                <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

            <p><em>Tailored Advertising</em></p>

            <p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the Platform
                may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone,
                or other device to collect information about your use of the Platform in order to (a)
                inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits to our websites
                and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content impressions, other uses of
                marketing services, and interactions with these marketing impressions and marketing
                services are related to visits to our websites. We also allow other third parties
                (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, Facebook
                and others) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or
                other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use
                to access the Platform. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the
                use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer,
                mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform by non-affiliated,
                third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated
                third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to
                opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive tailored
                advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated with
                de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to
                us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed,
                non-human-readable form.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how
                you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver
                tailored marketing, you may visit the
                <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out Link</a>
                and/or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Link</a>
                to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those
                programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google
                Display Network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings page</a>.
                Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still
                receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case,
                the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not
                control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make
                using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
                If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page,
                or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers,
                your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available
                on NAI's and DAA's websites, accessible by the above links.</p>

            <p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application
                advertising content. Each operating system-iOS for Apple devices, Android for
                Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices-provides its own instructions
                on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content. You
                may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective
                operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertising. For
                any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for
                the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.</p>

            <h3>CALIFORNIA DO-NOT-TRACK DISCLOSURE</h3>

            <p>Thumbtack is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information
                collected on our Platform for third party purposes. That is why we have provided
                links (above) to the NAI "Consumer Opt-Out" link, the DAA opt-out link, and a
                Google opt-out link. However, Thumbtack does not currently recognize or respond to
                browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still
                working on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.</p>

            <h3>PRIVACY OF MINORS</h3>

            <p>Our Services are not designed for minors under 18. Only persons 18 years of age or
                older may use the Platform. If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided
                us with personal information, we will close the account and delete the personal
                information to the extent required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
                We may, where permitted by law, retain certain information internally for purposes
                described in this Policy.</p>

            <h3>SECURITY</h3>

            <p>We employ physical, procedural and technological security measures to help protect
                your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Thumbtack may use
                encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal
                information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No security measures,
                however, are 100% failsafe. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and
                thus you should not expect, that your personal information or communications will
                not be collected, disclosed and/or used by others. You should take steps to protect
                against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other
                things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that
                nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password private,
                and not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts. Thumbtack is not
                responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen,
                or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized
                password activity.</p>

            <h3>LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS</h3>

            <p>The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over which Thumbtack
                does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Thumbtack
                of those external websites. You acknowledge that Thumbtack is providing these links
                to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Thumbtack is not responsible
                for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of
                information you provide while visiting such external websites.</p>

            <h3>UPDATING, DELETING, AND CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>You may review, correct and delete certain information about you by logging in to the
                Platform and navigating to your preferences page in "Your Dashboard." You must
                promptly update your Account information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your
                request, we will close your Account and remove your profile information from view
                as soon as reasonably possible. We may retain information from closed Accounts in
                order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,
                troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any user, enforce our Terms
                of Use, and/or for any other purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem
                necessary in our sole discretion. You should understand, however, that once you
                transmit User Content through the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove
                it. Once we have deactivated or removed your Account, you agree that Thumbtack will
                not be responsible to you for retaining information related to your Account.</p>

            <h3>YOUR CHOICES REGARDING EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS</h3>

            <p>We may send periodic emails to you. You may opt out of promotional emails by
                following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may
                take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt out of
                receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest
                you, we may still send you emails about your Account or any services you have
                requested or received from us.</p>

            <h3>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>

            <p>THIS POLICY IS CURRENT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE SET FORTH ABOVE. THUMBTACK MAY, IN

            <h3>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</h3>

            <p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal data
                will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection and privacy
                regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the

                United States, by using the Platform, you agree to this Policy and you consent

              privacy. In this Privacy Policy ("Policy"), we describe the information we collect, how

            <h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

            <p>How we collect and store information depends on how you access
              and use the Platform. We collect information in multiple ways including when you

            <p>We may collect information from you during your use or access of
              the Platform, such as:</p>

            </ul>

            <p>This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; the
              Privacy Policy applies to <em>all</em> use
              of the Platform.</p>

              the Platform or communications with us. It may
              also include information specific to services you are requesting or offering through
              the Platform, such as a business name, service description, qualifications and
              credentials. You are not required to provide us with such information, but certain
              features of the Platform may not be accessible or available, absent the provision of
              the requested information.</p>

            <p><em>Information from Affiliates, Social Networking
              Sites, and other Non-affiliated Third Parties</em></p>

            <p>We may collect information about you or others through Thumbtack
              affiliates or through non-affiliated third parties. For example, you may be able to
              access the Platform through a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you
              access the Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to
              certain information in your Facebook profile. This may include your name, profile
              picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email
              address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or
              "likes." </p>

            <p>Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have their own policies
              for handling your information. For a description of how these sites may use and
              disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the
              sites' privacy policies. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or
              discloses the personal information it collects about you.</p>

            <p>We may also collect information about you or others through
              non-affiliated third parties. For example, to the extent permitted by law, we may, in
              our sole discretion, ask for and collect supplemental information from third parties,
              such as information about your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify
              your identity or trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes. We
              may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with information
              that we obtain from such third parties and information derived from any other products
              or services we provide.</p>

            <p><em>Information That is Passively or Automatically
              Collected</em></p>

            <p><em>Device/Usage Information.</em> We and our
              third-party service providers, which include ad networks and analytics companies
              including DoubleClick and Google Analytics, may use cookies, web beacons, and other
              tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including
              mobile devices) you use to access the Platform. As described further below, we may
              collect and analyze information including but not limited to (a) browser type; (b) ISP
              or operating system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e) referring or exit pages; (f)
              page views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or Android ID);
              and (i) the type of device that you use. We may also track how frequently you access or
              use the Platform. We use this information (including the information collected by our
              third-party service providers) for Platform analytics (including to
              determine which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what
              our users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and
              off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as
              otherwise described in this Policy.</p>

            <p><em>Location Information.</em> When you use the
              Platform, we may collect general location information (such as IP address). If you
              install our mobile app, we may ask you to grant us access to your mobile device's
              geolocation data. If you grant such permission, we may collect information about your
              precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the Platform, including
              providing you with location-based features (e.g. for identification of Pro Services
              available near you). To deliver customized content and advertising, we may share your
              location information with our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the
              Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with
              location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking
              functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device
              manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you
              disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the
              Platform.</p>

            <p><em>Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies.</em>
              We and our third-party service providers may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags,
              and other technologies that help us better understand user behavior, personalize
              preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform. These
              technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your
              password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage
              content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We also use certain of these
              technologies to deliver advertisements through the Platform that may interest you. We
              or our third-party service providers also may use certain of these technologies in
              emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails
              are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>

            <p>We may also use local shared objects (also known as "Flash
              cookies") to assist in delivering special content, such as video clips or animation.
              Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they are not managed through your web
              browser. To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe
              website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.</p>

            <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
              automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser
              settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented
              from taking full advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly. Flash
              cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available
              in a web browser may not affect flash cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we
              may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>

            <h3>WHEN THUMBTACK DISCLOSES YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

              information that we collect from you through the Platform as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><em>Affiliates.</em> We may share your
                information with any Thumbtack affiliates.</li>
                <li><em>Consent.</em> We may disclose your
                information to nonaffiliated third parties based on
                your consent to do so. Such consent includes the disclosure of your information (a)
                in order to provide services or products that you have requested (please see below
                for more details); (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as described in this
                Policy, the Terms of Use, or any other legal terms governing your use of the
                Platform.</li>
                <li><em>Service Providers</em>. We may provide
                access to your information to select third parties who
                perform services on our behalf. These third parties provide a variety of services to
                us including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market
                research, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, identity verification,
                fraud and safety protection and legal services. As we retain new service
                providers, we generally seek contractual assurances from these service providers that

                injury or death, or that harm or fraud could be directed to Thumbtack or users; or
                (b) we are precluded from providing notice by law. We will attempt to provide the

                prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud,
                situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,

                your identity and mobile device identifier to third-party app store providers (for
                example, the Apple App Store) to allow you to download our mobile apps.</li>

                <li><em>Academics and Research</em>. We may
                provide information about users to third parties for academic and research purposes,
                in anonymized or aggregated form.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please be advised that some information you provide will be
              publicly accessible. For instance, registration for an Account requires that you
              provide us with your name. If you register through Facebook, the Platform will use the
              name associated with your Facebook account. Your name (full name, or in
              some instances, your first name and last initial) may be visible to other users.
              Depending on the circumstances, your name may be
              attached to your Content or information, such as scheduling of Pro Services, service
              requests, reviews, participating in discussions or forums, messaging, and profile
              information. Certain other people, including other users with whom you have interacted
              via the Platform, will see information about you that is attached to your name. For
              example (but without limitation), if you are a Customer Member seeking Pro Services, the
              description you provide of your desired services, along with your name, will be
              shown to some Pro Members
              registered in the relevant category along with your name. Thus, other users may be able
              to personally identify you based on Content you provide.</p>

            <p>We invite you to post Content on or through our Platform, including,
                but not limited to, your comments,pictures, and any other information. However, please
                be careful and responsible whenever you are online. If you choose to post User Content
                on or through the Platform, such as through Member-to-Member messaging or through our
                review boards, forums, blogs, or other postings, that information: (a) may be or may
                become publicly available; (b) may be collected and used by third parties without
                our knowledge; and (c) may be used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law,
                or your personal privacy.</p>

            <h3>ONLINE ANALYTICS AND TAILORED ADVERTISING</h3>

            <p><em>Analytics</em></p>

            <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on the Platform, such
              as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology
              described in the Information That Is Passively or Automatically Collected section above
              to help us analyze how users use the Platform, including by noting the third-party
              website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be
              disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information
              to evaluate your use of the Platform. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes
              related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google
              Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the
              <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">
                      Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a>.</p>

            <p><em>Tailored Advertising</em></p>

            <p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed
              via the Platform may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your
              computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of
              the Platform in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on
              past visits to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content
              impressions, other uses of marketing services, and interactions with these marketing
              impressions and marketing services are related to visits to our websites. We also allow
              other third parties(e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google
              Analytics, DoubleClick, Facebook and others) to serve tailored marketing
              to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer,
              mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Platform. We neither have access
              to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that
              may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the
              Platform by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any
              other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer
              you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive
              tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated
              with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted
              to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed,
              non-human-readable form.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in more information about tailored browser
              advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer
              to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the <a class="c0" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">
                        Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out
                        Link</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">
                        Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out Link</a> to
              opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those
              programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google
              Display Network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">
                        Google Ads Settings page</a>. Please note that to the extent advertising
              technology is integrated into the Platform, you may still receive advertising content
              even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will
              just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above
              opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms
              or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are
              configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently
              erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers,
              your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.
              Additional information is available on NAI's and DAA's websites, accessible by the above
              links.</p>

            <p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored
              in-application advertising content. Each operating system-iOS for Apple devices,
              Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices-provides its own
              instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application marketing
              content. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the
              respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application
              advertising. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy
              settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform
              operator.</p>

            <h3>CALIFORNIA DO-NOT-TRACK DISCLOSURE</h3>

            <p>Thumbtack is committed to providing you with meaningful choices
                about the information collected on our Platform for third party purposes. That is why
                we have provided links (above) to the NAI "Consumer Opt-Out" link, the DAA opt-out link,
                and a Google opt-out link. However, Thumbtack does not currently recognize or respond to
                browser-initiated Do-Not-Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working
                on Do-Not-Track standards, implementations and solutions.</p>

            <h3>PRIVACY OF MINORS</h3>

            <p>Our Services are not designed for minors under 18. Only persons 18 years of age or older
                may use the Platform. If we discover that an individual under 18 has provided us with personal
                information, we will close the account and delete the personal information to the extent
                required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. We may, where permitted by law,
                retain certain information internally for purposes described in this Policy.</p>

            <h3>SECURITY</h3>

            <p>We employ appropriate physical, procedural and technological security measures, which
                are reasonably designed to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access
                or disclosure. Thumbtack may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to
                help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. No
                security measures, however, are 100% failsafe. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot
                guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private
                communications will not be collected, disclosed and/or used by others. You should take
                steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among
                other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password
                that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your log-in and password private, and
                not recycling passwords from other websites or accounts. Thumbtack is not responsible for
                the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords,
                or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.</p>

            <h3>LINKS TO EXTERNAL PLATFORMS</h3>

            <p>The Platform may contain links to other websites or resources over
                which Thumbtack does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement
                by Thumbtack of those external websites. You acknowledge that Thumbtack is providing
                these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Thumbtack is not
                responsible for the content of such external websites or the protection and privacy of
                information you provide while visiting such external websites.</p>

            <h3>UPDATING, DELETING, AND CORRECTING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>You may review, correct and delete certain information about you by
                logging in to the Platform and navigating to your preferences page in "Your Dashboard."
                You must promptly update your Account information if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon
                your request, we will close your Account and remove your profile information from view
                as soon as reasonably possible. We may retain information from closed Accounts in order
                to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,
                troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any user, enforce our Terms of
                Use, and/or for any other purposes otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in
                our sole discretion. You should understand, however, that once you transmit User
                Content through the Platform, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have
                deactivated or removed your Account, you agree that Thumbtack will not be responsible to
                you for retaining information related to your Account.</p>

            <h3>YOUR
                CHOICES REGARDING EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS</h3>

            <p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you.
                You may opt out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained
                in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process
                opt-out requests. If you opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other
                information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your Account
                or any services you have requested or received from us.</p>

            <h3>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>

            <p>THIS POLICY IS CURRENT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE SET FORTH ABOVE.
                THUMBTACK MAY, IN ITS SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION, CHANGE THIS POLICY AT ANY TIME.
                THUMBTACK WILL POST ITS UPDATED POLICY ON THE PLATFORM, SEND YOU A MESSAGE OR OTHERWISE
                NOTIFY YOU WHEN YOU ARE LOGGED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT IN ADVANCE OF THE NEW EFFECTIVE DATE.
                THUMBTACK ENCOURAGES YOU TO REVIEW THIS POLICY REGULARLY FOR ANY CHANGES. YOUR CONTINUED
                ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE PLATFORM WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE THEN-CURRENT POLICY.</p>

            <h3>CONSENT TO TRANSFER</h3>

            <p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so
                your personal data will be processed by us in the United States, where data protection
                and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of
                the world, such as the European Union. If you create an Account with the Platform as a
                visitor from outside the United States, by using the Platform, you agree to this Policy
                and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may
                not offer a level of protection equivalent to that required in the European Union or
                certain other countries, and to the processing of that information as described in this
                Policy.</p>
