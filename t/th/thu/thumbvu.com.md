# ThumbVu - Privacy

## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At ThumbVu.com we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, ThumbVu.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.ThumbVu.com's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ThumbVu.com's visitors use its website. From time to time, ThumbVu.comc may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

ThumbVu.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.ThumbVu.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to ThumbVu.com's websites choose to interact with ThumbVu.com in ways that require ThumbVu.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ThumbVu.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.  In each case, ThumbVu.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with ThumbVu.com. ThumbVu.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

ThumbVu.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Automattic may monitor the most popular blogs on the WordPress.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. ThumbVu.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ThumbVu.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

ThumbVu.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ThumbVu.com's behalf or to provide services available at ThumbVu.com's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ThumbVu.com's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ThumbVu.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ThumbVu.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when ThumbVu.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ThumbVu.com, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an ThumbVu.com website and have supplied your email address, ThumbVu.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with ThumbVu.com and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ThumbVu.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

ThumbVu.com visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ThumbVu.com's websites, with the drawback that certain features of ThumbVu.com's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
