**Automatically Collected Information and Use**

When you access and use the Wazee Digital Website, we automatically collect some information, through certain web technologies such as “cookies,” regarding your computer usage and store it in log files. This information includes the internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. 

We use this unidentifiable information to analyze trends, to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

Wazee Digital also utilizes third party vendors, including Google, to show Wazee Digital advertisements on the Internet. 

Additionally, we do collect personally identifiable information such as IP addresses for analytical purposes. 

**Security Features**

Wazee Digital considers protection of your personal information a high priority, and therefore, Wazee Digital uses SSL encryption technologies to insure privacy when transmitting sensitive information to our servers. Unfortunately, there is no perfect security on the Internet, and Wazee Digital does not guarantee that our Website is impenetrable or invulnerable to hackers or other security breaches. Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of user information. Upon request we offer visitors the ability to have inaccuracies corrected in contact information and communications that the user/visitor has directed to our Website.

Wazee Digital uses clear GIFs, a tiny 1×1 pixel GIF, to digitally watermark our images, in both a visible and invisible manner. When you purchase a licensed image from Wazee Digital, the visible watermark is then removed from the image, however, in certain lower resolution images, an invisible watermark may remain, allowing Wazee Digital and the third party to track certain usage of such images on the Internet. 

We use “pixel tags” (also called “web beacons” or “clear gifs”), which are tiny graphic images, on our Website and in our emails. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our Website and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information. 

Pixel tags on our Website may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with our Website. This information may include your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to our Website. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites. 

Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us. We also work with third-party companies, including Google, that use tracking technologies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our Website and your interaction with our advertising and other communications.
