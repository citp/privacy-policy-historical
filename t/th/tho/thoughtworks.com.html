<h3>THOUGHTWORKS, INC. ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p class="MainCopy">
A) ThoughtWorks is committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

<p>
This website is administered by ThoughtWorks, Inc. ("ThoughtWorks").
ThoughtWorks wants you to feel secure when visiting our website and is
committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so. This Online
Privacy Policy applies to data collected by ThoughtWorks through its
website. Please read this ThoughtWorks Online Privacy Policy very
carefully.</p>

<br>

<p>Our site may contain links to other websites over which we
have no control. ThoughtWorks is not responsible for the privacy
policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link
from this site. </p>

<br>

<p>B) What information does ThoughtWorks gather?</p>

<br>

<p>ThoughtWorks gathers information in two ways:<br>

(1) Indirectly (through our site's technology); and<br>

(2) Directly (when you provide information to us).<br>

</p>

<br>

<p>
One example of information we collect indirectly is information
collected through our Internet access logs. When you access the
ThoughtWorks website, your Internet address is automatically collected
and is placed in our Internet access logs. We may also record the URLs
of the websites and pages you visit (before, during and after your
visit to any ThoughtWorks Website), the times and dates of such visits,
information about the computer hardware and software you use and other
information that may be available.</p>

<br>

<p>Additionally, we collect information directly from you in a
number of ways, including through the use of cookies. Cookies are small
files of information which save and retrieve information about your
visit to the ThoughtWorks website for example, how you entered our
site, how you navigated through the site, and what information was of
interest to you. The cookies we use identify you merely as a number.
However, if you are uncomfortable regarding the use of cookies, you can
disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in
preferences or options menu in your browser.</p>

<br>

<p>We also collect information directly when you voluntarily
submit it to us. We may provide the opportunity to sign-up for a
periodic email newsletter by entering in your email address. It is
completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it.
Additionally, we collect personal information when you apply online for
a job opening at ThoughtWorks. </p>

<br>

<p>C) How does ThoughtWorks use this information?</p>

<br>

<p>
We analyse the information we gather to determine what is most
effective about our site, to help us identify ways to improve it, and
eventually, to determine how we can tailor the ThoughtWorks website to
make it more effective.</p>

<br>

<p>
The personal information ThoughtWorks collects when you apply online
for ThoughtWorks employment opportunities is used to determine whether
to pursue an employment relationship. </p>

<br>

<p>We may also use data for other purposes, which we would
describe to you at the point we collect the information.</p>

<br>

<p>D) Will we share this with non-ThoughtWorks parties?</p>

<br>

<p>Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and
transferred between any of the countries in which ThoughtWorks, its
respective partners, affiliates or contractors, has offices in order to
enable ThoughtWorks to use the information as set out in this Online
Privacy Policy. If you are in the European Union, Canada or Australia,
information which you provide may be transferred to countries
(including the United States) which do not have data protection laws
equivalent to those in force in the European Union, Canada or
Australia. You expressly agree to such transfers. ThoughtWorks will
only share personal information with non-ThoughtWorks parties with your
consent, as required by law or to protect ThoughtWorks, its customers,
or the public, or with companies that help us fulfil our obligations
with you, and then only with partners who share ThoughtWorks'
commitment to protecting your privacy and data. We will respect and
protect your privacy as set out in this Online Privacy Policy and we
will not sell individual information. </p>

<br>

<p>We reserve the right to disclose any information that we
obtain through any ThoughtWorks website to appropriate governmental or
regulatory authorities, if required by law or any governmental agency. </p>

<br>

<p>E) How does ThoughtWorks protect sensitive personal
information?</p>

<br>

<p>Other than the information you provide when you apply for an
employment position at ThoughtWorks, we do not seek to collect
sensitive personal information through this site. By providing the
information, you consent to our proposed uses of such information. By
providing us with unsolicited sensitive personal information, you
consent to our using the information subject to applicable law as
described in this Online Privacy Policy. "Sensitive personal
information" includes to the various categories of personal information
and data identified by United States, European and other privacy laws
as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the
need to obtain explicit consent. These categories include personal
identity numbers, personal data about personality and private life,
racial or ethnic origin, nationality, political opinions, membership of
political parties or movements, religious, philosophical or other
similar beliefs, membership of a trade union or profession or trade
association, physical or mental health, genetic code, addictions,
sexual life, property matters or criminal record (including information
about suspected criminal activities).</p>

<br>

<p>F) What access do you have to your information?</p>

<br>

<p>You are entitled to know whether we hold information about you
and, if we do, the type of information, the purposes for which we hold
it, the possible recipients or types of recipients and to have access
to that information and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate.
You can do this by sending us an e-mail at the email address listed
below. Upon written request and within a reasonable period of time we
will correct, delete and/or block personal information from further
processing if that information proves to be factually inaccurate,
incomplete, or irrelevant to the purpose(s) of the processing.</p>

<br>

<p>G) What is ThoughtWorks practice regarding data security?</p>

<br>

<p>We take appropriate steps to maintain the security of your
information/data on our website. You should understand that the open
nature of the Internet is such that information/data may flow over
networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by
people other than those for whom the information/data is intended.</p>

this Online Privacy Policy or any complaints about ThoughtWorks online
privacy, please contact us at:</p>
