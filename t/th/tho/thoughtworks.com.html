<h3 id="toc1">THOUGHTWORKS, INC. ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
 <br> <div> A) ThoughtWorks is committed to protecting your privacy.<p>This website is administered by ThoughtWorks, Inc. ("ThoughtWorks"). ThoughtWorks wants you to feel secure when visiting our website and is committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so. This Online Privacy Policy applies to data collected by ThoughtWorks through its website. Please read this ThoughtWorks Online Privacy Policy very carefully.

</p><p>Our site may contain links to other websites over which we have no control. ThoughtWorks is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from this site.

</p><p>B) What information does ThoughtWorks gather?

</p><p>ThoughtWorks gathers information in two ways:

</p><p>(1) Indirectly (through our site's technology); and

</p><p>(2) Directly (when you provide information to us).

</p><p>One example of information we collect indirectly is information collected through our Internet access logs. When you access the ThoughtWorks website, your Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs. We may also record the URLs of the websites and pages you visit (before, during and after your visit to any ThoughtWorks Website), the times and dates of such visits, information about the computer hardware and software you use and other information that may be available.

</p><p>Additionally, we collect information directly from you in a number of ways, including through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files of information which save and retrieve information about your visit to the ThoughtWorks website for example, how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site, and what information was of interest to you. The cookies we use identify you merely as a number. However, if you are uncomfortable regarding the use of cookies, you can disable cookies on your computer by changing the settings in preferences or options menu in your browser.

</p><p>We also collect information directly when you voluntarily submit it to us. We may provide the opportunity to sign-up for a periodic email newsletter by entering in your email address. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it. Additionally, we collect personal information when you apply online for a job opening at ThoughtWorks.

</p><p>C) How does ThoughtWorks use this information?

</p><p>We analyse the information we gather to determine what is most effective about our site, to help us identify ways to improve it, and eventually, to determine how we can tailor the ThoughtWorks website to make it more effective.

</p><p>The personal information ThoughtWorks collects when you apply online for ThoughtWorks employment opportunities is used to determine whether to pursue an employment relationship and for the purposes of our equal opportunity monitoring.

</p><p>We may also use data for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point we collect the information.

</p><p>D) Will we share this with non-ThoughtWorks parties?

</p><p>Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which ThoughtWorks, its respective partners, affiliates or contractors, has offices in order to enable ThoughtWorks to use the information as set out in this Online Privacy Policy. If you are in the European Union, Canada or Australia, information which you provide may be transferred to countries (including the United States) which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Union, Canada or Australia. You expressly agree to such transfers. ThoughtWorks will only share personal information with non-ThoughtWorks parties with your consent, as required by law or to protect ThoughtWorks, its customers, or the public, or with companies that help us fulfil our obligations with you, and then only with partners who share ThoughtWorks' commitment to protecting your privacy and data. We will respect and protect your privacy as set out in this Online Privacy Policy and we will not sell individual information.

</p><p>You may find links to third party websites on our Website. These sites are owned and operated independently of us and may collect information about you. This Online Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of those third-party web sites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies whatsoever as we have no control over them.

</p><p>We reserve the right to disclose any information that we obtain through any ThoughtWorks website to appropriate governmental or regulatory authorities, if required by law or any governmental agency.

</p><p>E) How does ThoughtWorks protect sensitive personal information?

</p><p>Other than the information you provide when you apply for an employment position at ThoughtWorks, we do not seek to collect sensitive personal information through this site. By providing the information, you consent to our proposed uses of such information. By providing us with unsolicited sensitive personal information, you consent to our using the information subject to applicable law as described in this Online Privacy Policy. "Sensitive personal information" includes to the various categories of personal information and data identified by United States, European and other privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent. These categories include personal identity numbers, personal data about personality and private life, racial or ethnic origin, nationality, political opinions, membership of political parties or movements, religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs, membership of a trade union or profession or trade association, physical or mental health, genetic code, addictions, sexual life, property matters or criminal record (including information about suspected criminal activities).

</p><p>F) What access do you have to your information?

</p><p>You are entitled to know whether we hold information about you and, if we do, the type of information, the purposes for which we hold it, the possible recipients or types of recipients and to have access to that information and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate. You can do this by sending us an e-mail at the email address listed below. Upon written request and within a reasonable period of time we will correct, delete and/or block personal information from further processing if that information proves to be factually inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant to the purpose(s) of the processing.

</p><p>G) What is ThoughtWorks practice regarding data security?

</p><p>We take appropriate steps to maintain the security of your information/data on our website by using encryption where appropriate. You should understand that the open nature of the Internet is such that information/data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the information/data is intended. We recommend that you always log out after each session and close the browser when done, especially when accessing the service from public terminals.
