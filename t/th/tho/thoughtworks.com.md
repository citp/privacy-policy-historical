CloudFront delivers content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that is being served with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.  


• If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately.

• If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon S3 bucket (where we have hosted our assets for the website) or an HTTP server (in our case, our production web servers in Rackspace) that has been identified as the source for the definitive version of the content.

CloudFront captures information about each request that includes system logs which captures the following information: IP address, lat/long of the server which served the request, country and date and time.

####  _12.5 Disqus_

Disqus is an online service provider of Disqus, Inc, 301 Howard St, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, <https://disqus.com/> (“Disqus“), which provides a centralized discussion platform for websites. In our online services, we have integrated Disqus plugins that allow website visitors to post comments on our websites and link comments across multiple sites (including third party websites).

If you enter a page on our website which includes a Disqus plug-in, your browser will establish a direct connection to the Disqus servers from where the plug-in is loaded. The information that your browser visited the corresponding page of our online services is transmitted to Disqus, even if you do not have a Disqus account or are not logged into your account. This information is sent directly from your browser to a Disqus server in the USA and stored there.

If you log into your Disqus account at the same time, it is also possible to assign the page retrieval to your Disqus account and allow Disqus to assign your surfing behavior directly to your account.

If you want to block the transmission and storage of your data and your behaviour, you must log out of your Disqus account before you visit our website and delete any cookies placed by Disqus.

To post a comment on our website (using a Disqus plug-in), you must log into your Disqus account.

With its help, we can keep track of what users do after they see or click on a Facebook advertisement. This enables us to monitor the effectiveness of Facebook ads for purposes of statistics and market research. Data collected in this way is anonymous to us, which means we cannot see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is saved and processed by Facebook. Facebook can connect this data with your Facebook account and use it for its own advertising purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Policy which can be found at <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>.

####  _12.7 Google Analytics_

Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google, Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, [www.google.com](https://www.google.com/) (“Google Analytics” or “Google”). Google Analytics employs cookies that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site. The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there. 

In using Google Analytics our website employs the extension “anonymizeIp”. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from EU/EEA member states. Google uses this information to analyze your use of our site, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to our website. 

Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law or where such third parties process this data on Google’s behalf. Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly as noted elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website. 

Google Analytics also offers a deactivation add-on for most current browsers that provides you with more control over what data Google can collect on websites you access. The add-on tells the JavaScript (ga.js) used by Google Analytics not to transmit any information about website visits to Google Analytics. However, the browser deactivation add-on offered by Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analysis services we may engage. 

Google Analytics also uses electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used. 

You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on referenced above at the following link: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>. 

For the cases in which personal data is transferred to the US, Google has self-certified pursuant to the EU-US Privacy Shield (<https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework)>. 

#### _12.8 Google Tag Manager (GTM)_

Google Tag Manager (GTM”) is a tag management system to manage JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analytics on websites. Tags are small code elements that, among other things, are used to measure traffic and visitor behaviour: to understand the effect of online advertising and social channels; to set up remarketing and orientation towards target groups; and to test and optimize websites. GTM makes it easier for us to integrate and manage our tags. We use GTM on our website to include the following tracking tools (as in described in detail this Section 12):

For registered users (see Section 5), this data may be linked to your user profile.

More information on Marketo’s privacy and cookie policy can be found here.

 _How does it work?_

We embed a Munchkin Javascript snippet on our site. When visitors come to a site, we place a cookie in the visitor’s web browser (if there wasn’t already one) and send messages to our servers about that visitor’s web activity. It is a first party cookie and is only visible for us.

 _What does Munchkin Capture?_

When on a page, Munchkin automatically gathers the following information:

● Page Visits

● Link Clicks

● IP Address

● Referrer

● Our cookie ID.

If you prefer that we do not place this cookie on your web browser you may opt out by clicking the Do Not Track (DNT) feature in your browser. This prevents tracking for your particular browser and device.

Our website uses the plugins offered by LinkedIn Slideshare to primarily share presentations and PDFs.

Regarding the use of LinkedIn Slideshare’s plugins (and all plugins offered by LinkedIn products) see the LinkedIn Slideshare’s Privacy Policy stating: “We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Services, including our sites, app and platform technology (e.g., our off-site plugins), such as when you view or click on content (e.g., learning video) or ads (on or off our sites and apps), perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps, share articles or apply for jobs.

####  _12.11 SoundCloud_

SoundCloud is an online audio distribution platform provided by SoundCloud Limited, Rheinsberger Str. 76/77, 10115 Berlin, Germany, c/o JAG Shaw Baker, Berners House, 47-48 Berners Street, London W1T 3NF, UK; [www.soundcloud.com](https://www.soundcloud.com/), (“SoundCloud”). SoundCloud enables its users to upload, record, promote and share their originally-created sounds. On our website we use SoundCloud to share podcasts in posts, and use SoundCloud plugins on our website. When you visit our website, a connection is established with the SoundCloud servers and the plugin is shown. This provides the SoundCloud server with information about the sites you have visited on our website. If you are logged onto SoundCloud as a member, then SoundCloud may automatically assign this information to your personal user account. When you activate the plugin (e.g., by clicking the start button of an audio file), the corresponding information is also assigned to your user account. You can prevent the automatic assignment of this information by logging out of your SoundCloud account and deleting its respective cookies before logging onto our website.

User interaction with the embedded player includes the following functionality:

• Play

• Pause

• duration of playback

• shares made on the podcast

However, all the information will be at an aggregated level and specificity is abstracted out. More information about SoundCloud’s privacy practices can be found at <https://soundcloud.com/pages/privacy>.

####  _12.12 SumoLogic_

Sumo Logic is a cloud-based log management and analytics service of Sumo Logic, Inc., 305 Main Street, Redwood City, CA 94063, USA, [www.sumologic.com](https://www.sumologic.com/) (“Sumo Logic”) that leverages machine-generated big data to deliver real-time IT insights. Sumo Logic uses a piece of software called an “Installed Collector”. An Installed Collector is a Java agent that receives logs and metrics from its sources and then encrypts, compresses, and sends the data to the Sumo service. As its name implies, an Installed Collector is installed in your environment, as opposed to a Hosted Collector, which resides on the Sumo service. After installing an Installed Collector, you add sources, to which the Installed Collector connects to obtain data to send to the Sumo service.

A Sumo source is an object, configured for a specific collector that scans a particular target periodically and sends newly available data to the Installed Collector. SumoLogic collectors are baked into all the server images used by the website and collect the following information. 

● IP address;

● date and time;

● session ID;

● Browser and version; and

● OS and version.

The above information is used by developers on ThoughtWorks’ digital team for debugging/monitoring purposes. Sumo Logic’s privacy policy can be found at <https://www.sumologic.com/privacy-statement/>.

####  _12.13 Twitter tailored audience_

Tailored audiences is the tool of Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, [www.twitter.com](https://www.twitter.com/) (“Twitter”), used to target existing users and customers to create remarketing campaigns. Targeting activity can include directly reaching out to users or visitors to the ThoughtWorks website and campaign pages and/or retargeting previous customer lists. Twitter sets a minimum size limit for a tailored audience to 500 users. If the tailored audience does not match 500 Twitter users, it will display as "audience too small" and will not be available for targeting. Details about Twitter’s policies for conversion tracking and tailored audiences can be found at <https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/other-policy-requirements/policies-for-conversion-tracking-and-tailored-audiences.html>.

####  _12.14 Urchin Tracking Module (UTM)_

UTM tags are not tools. UTM works as a custom URL for marketing campaigns and reports can be viewed in platforms like Google Analytics. UTM tags are appended as part of the visible URL in marketing programs to understand the specific instance of a link. UTM tag reports are observed in Google Analytics/Marketo (see Sections 12.7 and 12.9) for understanding visitors to our website – for example, if they have visited the website, clicked on a link or signed up to a conference/event. These details are collected at an aggregated level. Customizing the URL with UTM tags allows us to better understand the marketing activity, which then allows us to better serve our audience.

The tracking occurs via the UTM parameters that are appended in the URL. When a user clicks an UTM tagged URL, based on the parameters set, we will be able to track from which end source the user has interacted with that URL. 

#### _12.15 Wistia/Tencent_

Wistia provides software for creating, managing, and sharing videos for business with a customizable player and detailed analytics. Our website uses Wistia, provided by Wistia, Inc., 17 Tudor Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA, [www.wistia.com](https://www.wistia.com/) (“Wistia”) to host videos. Wistia includes features such as an integrated CDN (content delivery network) for faster loading, and improved quality control depending on the device type and internet speed of the user. It also features the ability to add subtitles for better clarity of the video content. Whenever you interact with any videos on our website, Wistia automatically receives and records information on its server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. 

As stated in Wistia’s privacy policy, Wistia may also use usage information, in identifiable form, to provide video owners with information directly related to the videos that they make available through the website.
