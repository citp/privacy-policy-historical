Additionally, we collect information directly from you in a number of ways, including through the use of cookies. Cookies are small files of information which save and retrieve information about your visit to the ThoughtWorks website for example, how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site, and what information was of interest to you. The cookies we use identify you merely as a number.

We also collect information directly when you voluntarily submit it to us. We may provide the opportunity to sign-up for a periodic email newsletter by entering in your email address. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it. Additionally, we collect personal information when you apply online for a job opening at ThoughtWorks.

The personal information ThoughtWorks collects when you apply online for ThoughtWorks employment opportunities is used to determine whether to pursue an employment relationship. 

We may also use data for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point we collect the information.

D) Will we share this with non-ThoughtWorks parties?

Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which ThoughtWorks, its respective partners, affiliates or contractors, has offices in order to enable ThoughtWorks to use the information as set out in this Online Privacy Policy.

You expressly agree to such transfers. ThoughtWorks will only share personal information with non-ThoughtWorks parties with your consent, as required by law or to protect ThoughtWorks, its customers, or the public, or with companies that help us fulfil our obligations with you, and then only with partners who share ThoughtWorks' commitment to protecting your privacy and data. We will respect and protect your privacy as set out in this Online Privacy Policy and we will not sell individual information. 

We reserve the right to disclose any information that we obtain through any ThoughtWorks website to appropriate governmental or regulatory authorities, if required by law or any governmental agency.
