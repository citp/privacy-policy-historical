Please read this ThoughtWorks Privacy Policy very carefully.

## B) Why ThoughtWorks collects personal information

During the course of carrying out our business and performing our services, ThoughtWorks collect personal information in order to conduct our business, to provide and market our services, and to meet our legal obligations. Sometimes, our clients may also require us to collect information on their behalf in connection with their services or products to you. We may also collect data for other purposes, which we would describe in more detail to you at the point we collect the information. 

You may refuse to provide us with some or all of your personal information; however, this may limit the ways in which we can interact with you, including providing you with our services.

## C) The kinds of information we collect

We usually collect the following kinds of personal information:

  * Name, address, occupation, and contact information (if it is for IT project research purposes, we may anonymise the information upon your request if it is practical to do so);  

  * Interests in our services or events, or that of our clients;  

  * Information about people’s dealings with us or our clients; and  

  * Your opinion or comments on certain matters (e.g., process, systems and IT services).  




## D) How information is collected

ThoughtWorks gathers information in two ways:

  * Indirectly (through our site's technology or through other third parties who collect information on our behalf or have the right to share your information with us); and  

  * Directly (when you provide information to us by way of paper or online forms or questionnaires filled out by you, face-to-face meetings, interviews, business cards or telephone conversations).  




One example of information we collect indirectly is information collected through our Internet access logs. When you access our website, your Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs. We may also record the URLs of the websites and pages you visit (before, during and after your visit to any ThoughtWorks website), the times and dates of such visits, information about the computer hardware and software you use and other information that may be available.

Additionally, we may collect information from you through the use of cookies. Cookies and their use on our website are explained in greater detail in the Tracking Technologies section in this policy.

We also collect information directly when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, we may provide the opportunity to sign up for a periodic email newsletter by entering your email address. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it. Additionally, we collect personal information when you apply online for a job opening at ThoughtWorks.
