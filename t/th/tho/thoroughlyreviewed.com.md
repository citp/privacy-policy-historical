# Privacy Policy

ThoroughlyReviewed.com has created this Privacy Policy in order to set forth the principles governing our information-gathering and dissemination practices, including but not limited to such activities as forums, chat rooms, personal profile pages, product reviews, article commentary, blogs, RSS feeds and newsletters, among other offerings. ThoroughlyReviewed.com has a strong commitment to the privacy of our users. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through ThoroughlyReviewed.comand not to information collected offline or to information you may provide to any third-party sites to which ThoroughlyReviewed.commay link, except as expressly provided herein.

## Information We Collect

**There are two kinds of information that ThoroughlyReviewed.com can obtain about you: “Anonymous Information” and “Personally Identifiable Information.”**

“Anonymous Information” consists of non-personally-identifiable data, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or domain, or information about your usage on ThoroughlyReviewed.comthat is used for administrative purposes only. For example, an IP address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may collect our users’ IP addresses for such purposes as to help diagnose problems with our servers and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, corporate affiliates and consultants, and to third parties that perform particular services on our behalf.

We may also use the information linked to IP addresses to ban users who violate our Terms and Conditions of use.

“Personally Identifiable Information” is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, street address, email address, or telephone number. We collect such information when, for example, you enter a contest, subscribe to our email newsletter, and participate in other interactive online activities such as forums.

When we collect Personally Identifiable Information from you, you will have the opportunity to “opt in” to receive email or other digital communications from us and/or our business partners.

If you have submitted your personal information to ThoroughlyReviewed.com, you may correct, amend or delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained on file about you if it is incorrect.

If you are a registered Community member of ThoroughlyReviewed.com, you may manage your membership information as well as your subscriptions. Simply login to your community account and click on “Account Options.” Click on the tab marked “Account” to manage your password and email address; click on the tab marked “Subscriptions ” to manage your newsletter subscriptions and Click on the tab, “Profile” to edit your public profile.

In all cases, we will only use your information as permitted by law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, however, we may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to others if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public.
