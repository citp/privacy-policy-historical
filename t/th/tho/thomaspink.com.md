SessionCam is used to record individual sessions occurring on the website in order to understand user interaction journey and troubleshoot areas where users may have problems using or accessing the website. SessionCam helps us to understand and improve the quality of service offered through the website. SessionCam is recorded infrequently and at random and we do not capture sensitive data like usernames, passwords, credit cards details or other sensitive information. Any data that is transmitted to SessionCam is sent through securely.
