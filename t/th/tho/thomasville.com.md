# Thomasville Furniture Privacy Policy

###### Privacy Policy

Furniture Brands International Inc. and our brands, which include but are not limited to Thomasville, Drexel Heritage, Broyhill, Henredon, Hickory Chair, Labarge, Lane, Laneventure, Maitland-Smith and Pearson, value our customers and respect your privacy. The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you what Personal Information we may collect from you, how we use such information, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct the information. This policy applies only to customers in the United States.

For purposes of this policy, “Personal Information” means any information by which you can be personally identified, and includes your name, your address, your telephone number, your e-mail address and the like. Most of our websites do not require that you submit Personal Information to us. There may be times (such as when you purchase or order a product or register to participate in contests, etc.) when we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, etc., and if you make a purchase, we may also maintain a record of your product purchases. In addition, our web servers may automatically recognize information regarding your domain name (or that of your access provider) and e-mail address, and we may use this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are.

In general, we use the Personal Information you provide only for internal purposes, such as:

  * for the specific purpose for which it was volunteered (for example, to complete a product purchase, to enter a contest, to answer an e-mail, etc.);
  * to improve the content, appearance and utility of our websites;
  * to track our visitors’ use of our websites for internal market research; and
  * to notify our visitors of updates to the websites or of new products or services. 



From time to time, we may contract with companies or persons, whose privacy practices are consistent with ours, to provide certain services including credit card processing, shipping, data management, promotional services, etc. We may provide these providers with the information needed for them to perform these services. In addition, we may use third-party advertising companies to serve or track ads on our website and other websites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use or disclosure of your information.

Our websites are general audience sites and are not targeted to or intended for use by children.
