Depending on how you wish the Supplier or Provider to respond to your request, you may be asked to provide certain personal information, including one or more of the following: name, telephone number, fax number, postal address and email address. We will only forward a Supplier or Provider the contact information you provide.

If you choose to call a phone number listed on the Thomas Websites for a Supplier or Provider, your phone contact information, including such information as your phone number, name and location, may be collected and provided to the Supplier or Provider. Additionally, the phone call may be monitored or recorded if a recorded message or other notification is provided at the beginning of the call to this effect, and the recording will be made available to the Supplier or Provider. Thomas and its affiliates, agents, contractors or service providers may also monitor, store, review and access such information and call recordings and use them in connection with the provision of services to Suppliers or Providers for business and marketing purposes. 

Additionally, many Suppliers or Providers may make certain services, information and software applications, such as CAD drawings or white papers, available to the users of Services free of charge. Some of these Suppliers or Providers may require that you provide your contact and personal information in exchange for access to these services, information and applications. If you do not provide the required information, you will not be able to access these services, information and applications. Once information has been provided to a Supplier or Provider, it is out of the control of Thomas and subject to the policies of that Supplier or Provider.

### Transfers of Personal Data

### Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

We will make reasonable efforts to respond to such requests, but reserve the right to enforce reasonable limits in cases where the legitimate rights of persons other than the individual would be violated or where the burden or cost of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy.

### Customer End-User Data 

Since each Customer is in control of what information, including any personal information, it collects from its users, how that information is used and disclosed, and how that information can be changed, users of the Service must contact the applicable Customer administrator identified within the Customers privacy policy with any inquiries about how the Customer uses and discloses personal information and how to access or correct personal information contained in Customer data.
