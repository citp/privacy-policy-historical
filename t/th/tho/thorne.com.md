# Website Privacy Policy

Thorne Research has a longstanding commitment to safeguard the privacy of practitioner, customer, and patient information that is entrusted to us. The privacy principles and procedures set forth in this Website Privacy Policy are intended to tell you how we collect, use, and distribute user information via our primary public website (www.thorne.com). This Website Privacy Policy also applies to other proprietary websites that are operated or controlled by Thorne Research. This Website Privacy Policy does not cover information collected from sources other than Thorne Research-affiliated websites.

#### Types and Uses of Personal Information

When you use this website, personally identifiable information about you may be collected and processed by Thorne Research employees. In general, we only collect information – such as your name, business address, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, and professional licensing information – when you knowingly provide it to us. In addition, Thorne Research may automatically collect or process personally identifiable information (such as your Internet domain or IP address) as part of the normal operation of our website, or during the normal course of your activities on or use of our website. In nearly all cases this data is collected or processed by, or transferred to, Thorne Research's corporate headquarters in Dover, Idaho. By using our website, you are consenting to the collection, processing, transfer, or use of such personal data. If you do not consent to the collection, processing, transfer, or use of such information, then you should not use or discontinue using our website.

#### Personal Information Shared With Third Parties

Without the user's express consent, Thorne Research will not sell, trade, or disclose any user's personally identifiable information to any third party who would attempt to market products or services to the user. However, Thorne Research may disclose information to a third party that is assisting us in carrying out a transaction for you or providing a service to you (for example, packaging, sending, or delivering a purchase or information to you, or clearing a credit card transaction, or performing statistical analyses of our services).

Thorne Research may be required to disclose information as a result of a subpoena, a search warrant, or some other legal process authorized by a court of law. In addition, Thorne Research may disclose information to a third party that is assisting us in conducting an investigation in response to unauthorized activity that we believe constitutes a violation of Thorne Research's rules for using our website, or when circumstances reasonably dictate that we need to protect and defend the rights or property of Thorne Research.

#### Security Measures

Thorne Research regularly implements on our website server the most current technological and operational security processes to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or unintentional destruction. While no security measure can absolutely guarantee against compromise, Thorne Research regularly reviews and updates our security measures in an effort to provide appropriate security for all personally identifiable information held by Thorne Research.

#### Access and Accuracy

Thorne Research wants to maintain only accurate information about the users of our website. You can request individual information that has been gathered about you by contacting Thorne Research. Upon receipt of appropriate identification information, Thorne Research will provide you with access to the personally identifiable information that we maintain about your use of Thorne Research's website or which you have supplied to Thorne Research via Thorne Research's website. If you find a factual inaccuracy, you can notify Thorne Research and we will correct it.

#### Data Retention

Thorne Research will not retain your personal information longer than is necessary for the purpose it was collected.

#### Children's Privacy

Thorne Research takes children's privacy very seriously. Thorne Research's policy is that children under the age of 18 should not send any personally identifiable information to Thorne Research's website without the consent of their parents or guardian. Thorne Research encourages all parents and guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of personally identifiable information on the Internet. Thorne Research will not knowingly collect, use, or disclose to any third party any personally identifiable information collected from children under the age of 18.

#### Linked Websites

Thorne Research occasionally provides links from www.thorne.com and other proprietary websites that we control to third-party websites. Since we do not control these third-party websites, we encourage you to always review the privacy policies posted on these third-party websites. Thorne Research is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third-party websites or for services controlled by other companies or organizations.

#### Use of Cookies

Thorne Research may use "cookies" in connection with the operation of our website. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer by Thorne Research's website server. Cookies are used for record-keeping purposes; that is, so the stored information on your computer can be retrieved by the Thorne Research website server when you return to our website. This allows Thorne Research to personalize or regulate the use of our website, and also permits us to automate the access and data-entry functions of the website (for example, login information), to store online ordering information for purchases you make when visiting the website, and to tailor the appearance or presentation of the website to your preferences or interests.

Thorne Research does not use cookies to track the navigational habits of a user. If you visit our website to read or download content, most of the information we collect is statistical only and not personally identifiable (for example, the domain from which you access the Internet, the date and time you access our website, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website). We use this information about the number of visitors and their use of our website in aggregate form to make our website more useful and attractive to you.

The use of cookies is common in e-commerce and they are used at most major websites. Cookies will not be used to pass any information to your computer except the specific information placed into the cookie from the Thorne Research website server when the cookie is retrieved by the Thorne Research website server. You can adjust your Web browser to inform you whenever a cookie is being used or to reject cookies automatically; however, if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of the Thorne Research website may not function properly or permit the access you desire.

#### Contact Information

Practitioners, customers, and patients should direct comments or questions regarding this Website Privacy Policy to Thorne Research's Customer Service Department.

#### Modifications to Policy

Thorne Research reserves the right to change, modify, or update this Website Privacy Policy at any time without notice. We always indicate the date of the current Website Privacy Policy below, so you will know when it was last updated.
