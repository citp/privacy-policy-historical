# Privacy Policy and Information | Thomas Cook

The Thomas Cook Group understands and respects the importance of protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us, in respect of your relationship with us as a customer or a potential customer.  This information may be collected via our websites (“Sites”), our contact centres, our retail stores, our mobile applications (“Apps”), our questionnaires/surveys, our representatives or appointed agents in overseas destinations, or our social media channels (collectively, our “Services”).

Please read the following information carefully. You are responsible for ensuring that the other people that you are acting on behalf of (such as those included with you on a booking), are aware of the content of this Privacy Policy and you have checked with them that they agree to their personal data being given to us to make a booking or other purchase on their behalf.

By making a booking or other purchase or otherwise giving your personal data to us, we will transfer, store or process it as set out below. We will take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Which companies does this policy apply to:

This Privacy Policy applies to the holidays, travel products and services offered by Thomas Cook travel agency and tour operator companies in the UK (“Thomas Cook”).   When we say ‘we’ or ‘us’ in this Policy, we’re generally referring to the separate and distinct companies that make up Thomas Cook UK’s businesses (depending on the type of Services you use).

Depending on the nature of your contact with Thomas Cook your personal data will be processed by one or more of the companies mentioned above. 

Each company may publish its own supplementary privacy policy to explain how it will process and handle any personal data it collects from you.  For example, TCCT Retail  displays Privacy Notices in its stores, and Thomas Cook Tour Operations has data protection notices in its booking conditions and on its websites.   Any such supplementary policies apply in addition to this Privacy Policy.

## What types of personal data do we collect about you and why do we collect it:

 **We collect certain personal data about you and about any other person you include on your booking.    The sort of personal data we collect is information that you provide to us, that we collect from you or observe about you, or that we obtain from other sources.   Read on to find out more……**

### Personal data you give to us

  * When you make a booking or other purchase or enquiry we will ask you for your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, date of birth, and personal travel preferences. We need to collect this information in order to arrange the travel and other services you are requesting.
  

  * When you request to make a booking, depending on the arrangements you ask us to make for you, we will ask if you have any special requirements.  You may give us information concerning dietary requirements, medical /health conditions, disabilities, sexual orientation, race or religion.  This information is referred to as special categories of personal data and when you give us this information we’ll use it to try and ensure your particular needs in relation to a booking are met.  We may have to share that data with our third party suppliers and transfer it outside the European Economic Area (EEA), as described in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not want to provide this information to us, or after you have provided us with this information you ask us or our data compliance department to stop processing this information, it may mean we won’t be able to provide all or parts of the services you have requested.  If we have to cancel your booking/purchase as a result, you may incur a cancellation charge.
  

  * If you enter a competition or promotion, complete a survey, or if you give feedback on any of our Services, we will collect your name and relevant contact information and any other personal information you choose to give us.
  

  * We may ask to see and retain a copy of passport details and other identification documents if, for example, you are purchasing foreign currency or completing a money transfer.
  

  * If you contact us online, we may keep a record of your e-mail or other correspondence, and if you call us by telephone, we may monitor and/or record phone conversations for training and customer service reasons.
  

  * If, when using our Services, you make a holiday/travel search on our website or with one of our travel consultants and you enter or provide any of your personal data (including telephone number or e-mail address), but do not make a booking or other purchase, we will keep and use the data you’ve provided for a limited time and purpose, as mentioned below.



To help us keep your information current, accurate and complete, please ensure you tell us if anything needs to be changed.

### Personal data we collect and/or observe about you

Based on how you have used our Services in the past and your activity on our website, social media channels, or with our contact centre and stores, we collect the following personal data about you:

  * Details of the services we have provided to you in the past, including your previous travel arrangements, such as holidays and other purchases, and matters related to those arrangements, such as details of your previous requirements or complaints.
  

  * We collect details of your visits to our Sites and Apps (including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data and weblogs) whether this is required for our own purposes or otherwise, and of the resources that you access. We use third party technology services, such as Google Analytics to administer these services.
  

  * We collect details of website(s) you visited before you use a link to our Sites, pages visited in our Sites, and time spent on each page.
  

  * We may collect information about your computer (or mobile device/tablet) including, where available, your IP address, operating system, device location, browser type, cookie identification numbers, for system administration purposes, marketing purposes (both our own, and third party advertisers for whom we provide advertising services) and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and any reports we share do not identify any individuals.
  

  * Images of you taken on our CCTV systems at our premises.



### Personal data obtained from other sources 

We might also receive your personal data from third party sources who collect information about you on our behalf.  This includes:

  * If you tell a third party that you would like to receive marketing communications from Thomas Cook, they will securely transfer your contact details and marketing preferences to us.
  

  * If you book one of our holidays through a third party travel agent, certain personal data (as applicable to your booking, such as your name, date of birth or any special requirements you have) will be passed to us to provide the services you have requested/booked.
  

  * If you complete any of our customer feedback questionnaires/surveys, the information you provide will be processed on our behalf and provided to us by a third party such as InMoment Inc, MARU/EDR Limited or Feefo Holdings Ltd.
  

  * If you provide feedback on us via a Twitter survey, the feedback, but not your personal data, will be processed by Twitter and passed to us.  A digital marketing company called Social Chain Ltd is used by us to administer these surveys and other activity on our social media channels.



## Where is your data stored and who it’s shared with:

 **Your personal data is held on a combination of our own systems and systems of the suppliers we use to provide our services.   Read more here…..**

When you give your personal data to us, some of the personal data you provide will need to be given to and processed and stored by relevant third parties.  These third parties include:

  * our technology and data management partners who help us to administer the services we provide (such as GBG Group plc who provide data intelligence services, and both Crowd Technologies Ltd and Influence Digital who support how we manage our social media activity);
  

  * our travel partners, such as airlines, airports, hoteliers, insurance companies and ground handling agents (depending on the travel services you book), so that they can provide you with the arrangements and assistance you require.
  

  * our card payment facilitators, that help us process customer payments and assists us in  detecting and preventing fraudulent payments or bookings.



Some of these third parties may be based outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Organisations that are based outside of the EEA may not be subject to the same level of controls in regard to data protection as exist within the UK and the EEA.   We aim only to transfer your data to third parties outside of the EEA where either:

(a) your personal information will be subject to one or more appropriate safeguards set out in the law, if you’d like more information about our safeguards, please contact us. These safeguards might be the use of standard contractual clauses in a form approved by regulators, or having our suppliers sign up to an independent privacy scheme approved by regulators (like the US ‘Privacy Shield’ scheme); or

(b) the transfer is necessary to enable your contract to be performed.

In order for you to travel overseas, we may be required to disclose certain of your personal data to government bodies or other authorities in the UK and in other countries, such as those responsible for immigration, border control, law enforcement, security and anti-terrorism.

Even if it is not mandatory for us to provide information to such authorities, we may exercise our discretion to assist them where appropriate in the interests of detecting and preventing criminal activity.

We may disclose your personal information to any member of our Group for business purposes, (those business purposes include holding your data on central/shared systems for administering bookings and supporting customers in destination countries). Our Group means our subsidiaries and our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries.

We may pass your data to relevant third parties, such as a payment facilitator Ingenico Group for the purpose of detecting and preventing fraudulent payments or bookings.

## How do we use your information when providing our services to you:

 **In order to provide our services to you, we use the information we hold in a number of different ways.   We process your information either because it is necessary for us to do so as part of a contract you enter into, or because we have a legitimate business reasons for doing so.   Read more here……**

## How do we personalise our marketing to you:

 **To try and ensure that our marketing communications and advertising are relevant to you, we work with third parties to offer a better experience to customers and potential customers.   You can find out how we do this by reading more here…….**

Using new technologies and with the help of our advertising agencies and marketing activation platforms (including Dentsu Aegis Network and Converto), we may use your personal information in the following ways:

Our business partners and advertising networks  may  serve you with non-personalised adverts on our Sites via advertising technology Google Double Click for Publishers.  Non-personalised adverts are targeted using contextual information regarding the pages visited on our site, rather than the past behaviour of a user.  We allow third parties to collect information about your online activities using cookies and other technologies.   The third parties may include other Thomas Cook companies, our suppliers/business partners who collect information when you view or interact with an advert on one of our Sites, and advertising networks. We also collect information about your online activities using cookies and other technologies when you use websites other than our Sites to provide advertising services on behalf of our business partners. This technology allows us to display an advert to you relating to a business partner on other websites based on your page visits and other behaviours whilst on our Sites.

## Your rights in relation to any personal data we hold about you:

 **You have a number of rights in relation to your personal information under data protection law.   To find out more, please read here…..**

### Your Right to Access Your Personal Information

You have the right to make a Data Subject Access Request in many circumstances.  That is a request for access to the personal information that we hold about you.  If we agree that we have to provide personal information to you (or someone else on your behalf), we’ll provide it to you or them free of charge.

We may ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about your interactions with us that we can locate your personal information. That may include information about your previous booking(s) or other purchases.  If someone is acting on your behalf they will need to provide written and signed confirmation from you that you have given your authority to that person/company for them to make the request.  We will ask for this to be provided before we give you (or another person acting on your behalf) a copy of any of your personal information we may be holding. We may not provide you with a copy of your personal information if it includes the personal information of other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.  

Please see the section titled ‘[How to Contact Us](https://www.thomascook.com/privacy-policy#how-to-contact)’ if you need to make a Data Subject Access Request.

### Correcting and updating your personal information

The accuracy of your information is important to us and we are working on ways to make it easier for you to review and correct the information that we hold about you.

In the meantime, if you change your name or address/e-mail address, or you discover that any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date, please let us know by contacting our customer service team [here](https://support.thomascook.com/?website=thomascook/#intcmp=TopNav_CustomerSupport) or your local store (if you booked at that store).

### Withdrawing your consent

Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your personal information, as set out in section above titled ‘ **How do we use your information when providing our services to you** ’, you may withdraw your consent at any time. If you would like to withdraw your consent to receiving any direct marketing to which you previously opted-in, please see the section titled “ **What you need to do if you don’t want our marketing communications** ’ for further details. If you would like to withdraw your consent to us processing any special categories of personal data, please contact our customer service team [here](https://support.thomascook.com/?website=thomascook/#intcmp=TopNav_CustomerSupport) or your local store. Please note if you ask us to stop processing this information, it may mean we won’t be able to provide all or parts of the services you have requested. If we have to cancel your booking or other purchase as a result, you may incur a cancellation charge.

If you withdraw your consent, our use of your personal information before you withdraw is still lawful.

### Objecting to our use of your personal information 

Where we rely on our legitimate business interests as the legal basis for processing your personal information for any purpose(s), you may object to us using your personal information for these purposes by e-mailing or writing to us at the address provided at the end of this policy. Except for the purposes for which we are sure we can continue to process your personal information, we will temporarily stop processing your personal information in line with your objection until we have investigated the matter. If we agree that your objection is justified in accordance with your rights under data protection law, we will permanently stop using your data for those purposes. Otherwise we will provide you with our justification as to why we need to continue using your data.

### Erasing your personal information or restricting its processing

In certain circumstances, you may ask for your personal information to be removed from our systems by e-mailing or writing to us at the address at the end of this policy. Provided we do not have any continuing lawful reason to continue processing or holding your personal information, we will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request.

You may also ask us to restrict processing your personal information where you believe it is unlawful for us to do so, you have objected to its use and our investigation is pending or you require us to keep it in connection with legal proceedings.  We may only process your personal information whilst its processing is restricted if we have your consent or are legally permitted to do so, for example for storage purposes, to protect the rights of another individual or company or in connection with legal proceedings. 

### Transferring your personal information in a structured data file

Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your personal information or need to process it in connection with your contract, as set out in section titled ‘ **How do we use your information when providing our services to you** ’, you may ask us to provide you with a copy of that information in a structured data file.

You can ask us to send your personal information directly to another service provider, and we will do so if this is technically possible. We may not provide you with a copy of your personal information if it contains the personal information of other individuals or we have another lawful reason to withhold that information.

### How to contact us:

We encourage you to contact us if you have a complaint and we will seek to resolve any issues or concerns you may have.

You have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator where you believe your legal rights have been infringed, or where you have reason to believe your personal information is being or has been used in a way that doesn’t comply with the law.  The contact details for the Information Commissioner’s Office ( **ICO** ), the data protection regulator in the UK, are available on the [ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/).

## Keeping hold of your personal data:

 **If you want to find out more about our data retention policy, please read more here…..**

Where you’ve made a booking or other purchase with us, your personal information will be retained to ensure we provide the best possible customer service to you.  We retain your personal data for as long as is necessary for us to use your data as set out in this Privacy Policy.  This will generally be for up to 7 years in relation to bookings/purchases, or 2 years since you last engaged with us after receiving a marketing communication, or such other time that may be required for our legal and audit purposes or that is required by law.

## What is our approach to data security:

 **We take data security very seriously, to find out our approach to this please read more here…..**

The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, and although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Sites, therefore any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will take all reasonable steps to keep your personal data secure and to try to prevent any unauthorised access, use or loss of your data, by putting in place appropriate security measures and limiting access to those who have a business need to know.  All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers.  Any payment transactions will be encrypted using TLS technology. We do not store customer card data on our internal systems.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Sites, you are responsible for keeping that password confidential.  We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

We have a process to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and the ICO of a breach where legally required to do so.

## What happens when you follow a link from our website to a third party website:

 **Our Sites include links to other websites which include privacy policies of their own.   To learn more about this, please read here……**

Until that standard is established, we'll continue to review DNT and other new technologies, but won't respond to DNT requests.
