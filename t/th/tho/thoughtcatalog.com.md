We want you to know how information about you is collected, used, and shared with others. We also want you to know about the choices you have when you visit us at [http://www.thoughtcatalog.com](http://www.thoughtcatalog.com/) (the “Site”).

**Information We Collect**

When you visit our Site, send us or a Site writer an email, submit or comment on an article, or otherwise communicate with us or a Site writer, we may collect or have access to personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, a Site writer, or third parties acting on our behalf. We may also collect personal information from third parties, including without limitation, our business partners for marketing purposes and to deliver products or services you request. Personal information is information through which you can be identified such as your name, email address, photograph, and telephone number.

If you engage with our Site content through third-party social networking sites, we may have access to certain information associated with your social media account such as your name, email address, photograph, birthday, location, and people you follow or like. For information on controlling access to your personal information through social networking sites, you should review their privacy policies and terms of use.

We may use (or authorize third parties to use) web beacons, cookies, pixel tags, scripts, e-tags and other technologies (“Tracking Technologies”) at our Site to collect information about you, your online behavior, your computer, and your mobile device to optimize Site functionality, collect statistics, and deliver content tailored to your interests. Such information may include, without limitation, the type of browser and operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your geographic location, the pages you visit, how long you visit each page, the unique number assigned to your server or Internet connection, etc. These are stored in log files. We may combine this automatically collected information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing and analytics or site functionality. We may also collect anonymized cookies and other data obtained through Tracking Technologies from third parties for ad-targeting purposes.

At this time, we do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include “do not track” instructions. However, you can change some of your privacy preferences through your browser. For example, you can delete browser cookies from your computer or set your browser to reject browser cookies. However, doing so may limit some functionalities of our Site. Also, blocking or deleting browser cookies may not block or delete other types of cookies including flash cookies. We use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 or Local Shared Objects (LSO’s) such as Flash Cookies to collect and store information.

**Use of Information We Collect**

We may use the information we collect for our own marketing and non-marketing purposes. For example, we may use your personal information to alert you to upcoming articles, features, or events.
