# Thomas Nelson Privacy Policy | Thomas Nelson, Inc. - Publisher of Christian Books, Videos, Software, Bibles and Children's Books

Your right to privacy while using the World Wide Web is very important to Thomas Nelson, Inc. (“Thomas Nelson”). Thomas Nelson is committed to helping you maintain control over your personal data while fostering the growth of a more interactive, engaging and personalized Web experience. We respect your right to control how much information you provide about yourself. The following Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, protect and use information we receive from visitors to our web site (“[www.thomasnelson.com](https://web.archive.org/)”) (the “Site”).  This Policy applies only to information collected through this Site and not to information collected offline.

We do not collect personally identifiable information on our Site unless you voluntarily provide some information about yourself via an electronic mail message or by filling out one of our online forms. By “personal information,” we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address or telephone number. For example, if you send us an email, we may use the information you provide to follow up via telephone or email. The information you provide will be kept confidential and will be used only to support your continued relationship with Thomas Nelson.

No software or hardware techniques are employed to capture a visitor’s email address or other personally identifiable information. Thomas Nelson does not monitor individual traffic patterns on our Site, and we do not use “cookies” or invisible images to track how you use our Site. Our hosting company may collect anonymous, aggregate information or statistics related to Site usage. These statistics indicate the total number of hits, the total number of page hits, the number of kilobytes transferred from our Site, and the IP address of the visitor. We may have the ability to access this information, but have chosen not to avail ourselves of this data. If we decide to use this information to analyze Web traffic in the future, we will only be able to measure the number of visitors to our Site and the addresses of the web sites from which our visitors come. Email addresses and other personally identifiable information are not available to us.

2\. How the Information You Provide Is Used

Should you send us your comments or questions via email to any email address provided on our Site, we will only share your communications with our employees or agents most capable of addressing your questions and concerns.  We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response and then we will either discard it or, in some cases, archive it. We will only disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public.We do not sell, rent or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information you may provide without your consent. 

3. Security of Information Sent to Us

Please note that, unless we expressly advise you otherwise, the email functionality on our Site does not provide a means for completely secure and private communications between us. Like all unencrypted Internet email communications, your email may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. While we strive to protect your personal information, Thomas Nelson cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal systems. Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your communication may be discarded or archived. If you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the numbers provided throughout our Site.

4\. Disclosure of Customer Information Through Business Transfers

As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. Similarly, in the unlikely event that a portion or substantially all of Thomas Nelson assets are sold or transferred to a third party, the information you have voluntarily provided to us, including your email address, would likely be one of the transferred business assets.
