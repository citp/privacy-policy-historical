        of a more interactive, engaging and personalized Web experience. We respect 
        your right to control how much information you provide about yourself. 
        The following Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect, protect 
        and use information we receive from visitors to our web site (“<a href="default.asp">www.thomasnelson.com</a>”) 
        (the “Site”).&nbsp; This Policy applies only to information collected through 
        this Site and not to information collected offline.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in;text-align:justify;text-autospace:none">We do not collect personally identifiable information
on our Site unless you voluntarily provide some information about yourself via
an electronic mail message or by filling out one of our online forms. By
“personal information,” we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as a
name, address or telephone number. For example, if you send us an email, we may
use the information you provide to follow up via telephone or email. The
information you provide will be kept confidential and will be used only to
support your continued relationship with Thomas Nelson.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in;text-align:justify;text-autospace:none">No software or hardware techniques are employed to
capture a visitor’s email address or other personally identifiable information.
Thomas Nelson does not monitor individual traffic patterns on our Site, and we
do not use “cookies” or invisible images to track how you use our Site. Our
hosting company may collect anonymous, aggregate information or statistics
related to Site usage. These statistics indicate the total number of hits, the
total number of page hits, the number of kilobytes transferred from our Site,
and the IP address of the visitor. We may have the ability to access this
information, but have chosen not to avail ourselves of this data. If we decide
to use this information to analyze Web traffic in the future, we will only be
able to measure the number of visitors to our Site and the addresses of the web
sites from which our visitors come. Email addresses and other personally
identifiable information are not available to us.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.2in;text-align:justify;text-autospace:none">Should you send us your comments or questions via
email to any email address provided on our Site, we will only share your
communications with our employees or agents most capable of addressing your
questions and concerns.&nbsp; We will retain
your communication until we have done our very best to provide you with a
complete and satisfactory response and then we will either discard it or, in
some cases, archive it. We will only disclose personal information if we are
required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is
necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and
defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use
of the Site; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the
public.We do not sell, rent or otherwise disclose personally
identifiable information you may provide without your consent. </p>

otherwise, the email functionality on our Site does not provide a means for
completely secure and private communications between us. Like all unencrypted
Internet email communications, your email may be accessed and viewed by other
Internet users, without your knowledge and permission, while in transit to us.
For that reason, to protect your privacy, please do not use email to
communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. While we
strive to protect your personal information, Thomas Nelson cannot ensure or
warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at
your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will use our commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal systems. Depending on
the nature of the inquiry, your communication may be discarded or archived. If
you wish, you may contact us instead via telephone at the numbers provided
throughout our Site.</p>

merge or partner with other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire
customer information. In such transactions, user information may be among the
transferred assets. Similarly, in the unlikely event that a portion or substantially
all of Thomas Nelson assets are sold or transferred to a third party, the
information you have voluntarily provided to us, including your email address,
would likely be one of the transferred business assets.</p>
