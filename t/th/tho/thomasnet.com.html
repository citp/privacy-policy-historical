<span class="titletext">Privacy Policy</span>
<p>

So that you can better protect your privacy, ThomasNet provides this notice explaining our online information 
practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and used. If you do 
not agree with the practices explained in this policy, do not complete the Sign Up form or contact us using the 
"<a href="/contactus.html">Contact Thomas</a>" link at the top of each page of our site.
</p><p>

<em>NOTE: Without Signing Up, you cannot access certain features of ThomasNet </em>
</p><p>

<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
</p><p>
At times, ThomasNet will ask you to provide us with personal contact information. We will use this information to help customize 
your site experience, enhance our services or to facilitate communication with the companies that list on our site and our partners.  
You will be prompted to supply us with this information when signing up to use My Thomas or when initiating communication through the 
site. 

</p><p>
<strong>Sign Up - My Thomas</strong>
</p><p>

While you do not need to sign up to use ThomasNet, we do need some information from you to access certain features of the site; 
you are asked for limited personal and demographic information and are required to choose a username and password that will be 
used to gain access on subsequent visits to MyThomas. This information will constitute your user profile. While most of the 
information we collect is used internally for site analysis and improvement, some of your information is used in compiling 
reports (see reporting) for the companies that list on our site and to enhance their services.   However, it is important to note 
that ThomasNet will not disclose, without your consent, or associate with your site usage, any of your <em>personal contact 
information</em>, which consists of the following: 
</p><p>

Your First Name<br>
Your Last Name<br>
Your E-mail Address<br>
Your Username<br>
Your Password
</p><p>

You may edit or change your profile at any time by logging into My Thomas. Again, if you wish to delete your 
personal information use the "<a href="/contactus.html">Contact Thomas</a>" link and ask that your information 
be deleted. 

</p><p>
<strong>Control of Your Password</strong>
</p><p>

You are responsible for all actions taken with your Username and password, including any fees that may be charged to your account. 
Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your password to any third parties. If you choose to share your Username and 
password or your posted information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore 
you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over 
your posted information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been 
compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.

</p><p>
<strong>Communicating With Suppliers and Providers</strong>
</p><p>
 
When you use the communication features and software applications on ThomasNet to contact suppliers listed on our site and 
our providers, you will be asked to supply the contact information required by these companies to respond to your request. 
Depending on how you wish the company to respond to your request, you may be asked for the following: Telephone Number; Fax 
Number; Mailing Address and e-mail. We will only forward the contact information required to respond to your request and will 
not disclose your e-mail address unless you request to be contacted by e-mail. 
</p><p>

If you have not signed up to use My Thomas, we will not store any of the contact information you enter unless you choose to 
sign up with us. 
</p><p>

My Thomas users will be able to verify or change the information stored in their profile prior to sending the request. 
</p><p>

Many of the suppliers listed on ThomasNet.com and our providers will make additional information, such as CAD Drawings or 
White Papers, and software applications available to the users of ThomasNet.com free of charge. Some of these suppliers and 
providers may require your contact information in exchange for access to this information. Your consent will be required 
before any information is exchanged and such consent will be obtained in accordance with this policy.  If you decline to share 
your information with these suppliers and providers you will not be able to access those suppliers' and providers' information 
and services.  Once information has been shared with a supplier or provider, it is out of the control of ThomasNet.com and 
subject to the privacy policy of that supplier or provider.

</p><p>

By entering into our Terms of Use Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other users' posted information that you obtain through 
the ThomasNet website or through a ThomasNet-related communication or ThomasNet-facilitated transaction, ThomasNet hereby grants to 
you a license to use such information only for: (a) ThomasNet-related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, 
(b) using services offered through ThomasNet and (c) any other purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them the

Section, can you disclose posted information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of that user.
