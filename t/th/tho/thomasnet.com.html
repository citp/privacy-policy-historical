<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>
So that you can better protect your privacy, Thomas Industrial Network, Inc. ("THOMAS") provides this Privacy Statement 
explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your personal information is collected and 
used. By using this website, you accept the practices that are described in this Privacy Statement, which is part of the 
<a href="/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> governing the use of this website and the 
terms and conditions governing any other THOMAS service you use. If, however, 
any area within or feature offered by this website or other THOMAS website or service sets forth a separate or additional privacy 
statement, terms and conditions or other policy, then that separate privacy statement, terms and conditions or other policy shall 
apply in connection with that area, feature, website or service.  This Privacy Statement does not apply to personal information 
that is collected through the websites or other services of THOMAS or its affiliates based outside the United States of America 
or through any services offered by THOMAS or its affiliates outside the United States of America.
</p>
<p>
If you do not agree with the practices explained in this Privacy Statement, do not complete the Sign-Up for MyThomas form, create 
a MyThomas profile, contact us using the "Contact ThomasNet" link on this website or submit any personal information through this 
website or other THOMAS service.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Without signing up for MyThomas, you cannot access certain features of this website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
At times, you may voluntarily give us or THOMAS will ask you to provide personal information. For example, you will be prompted to 
supply us with personal information when signing up to use MyThomas, accessing certain features of this website or other THOMAS 
services or initiating communication through this website or other THOMAS services. We will use your personal information to, among 
other things, help customize your site experience, enhance our services and facilitate communications with you or between you and 
the companies that are a part of THOMAS' database of companies and are listed on this website ("Suppliers") and any other third 
parties that advertise on this website or provide services, features or information in connection with this website or to THOMAS 
("Providers").
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sign Up - MyThomas</strong>
</p>
<p>
While you do not need to sign up to use this website, you do need to sign up for a MyThomas account to access certain features of 
it. In those instances, you may be asked for personal and demographic information, including your Name, E-mail Address and Company 
Name, and you also will be required to choose a username and password that will be used to gain access on subsequent visits to 
MyThomas. This information will constitute your user profile. While most of your user profile is used internally for site analysis 
and improvement and other business purposes, some of it is used in compiling reports (see "Reporting" below) for Suppliers, Providers 
and our affiliates, agents and contractors and in connection with other THOMAS services. However, except as provided or permitted in 
this Privacy Statement, THOMAS will not disclose, without your consent, or associate with your site usage, any of your personal 
contact information provided through your MyThomas account. You may edit or change your user profile at any time by logging into 
MyThomas. If you wish to delete your user profile, use the "Contact ThomasNet" link and ask that your MyThomas account be deleted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Control of Your Password</strong>
</p>
<p>
You are responsible for all actions taken with your MyThomas username and password. Therefore, we do not recommend that you disclose 
your password to any third parties. If you choose to share your username and password with third parties, you are responsible for 
all actions taken with your MyThomas account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose control over your information 
(including, but not limited to, information provided when signing up for a MyThomas account or requesting quotes), data, text, 
software, music, sound, photographs, images, graphics, videos, messages, logos or other materials (collectively, "Content"), 
whether publicly posted on (including any forums or other public areas) or privately transmitted through (whether to us, other 
users, Suppliers or Providers) this website, and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if 
your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communicating With Suppliers and Providers</strong>
</p>
<p>
When you use the communication features and software applications on this website to initiate contact with Suppliers or Providers, 
you may be asked to supply contact information required by these companies to respond to your request to contact you. Depending on 
how you wish the Supplier or Provider to respond to your request, you may be asked to provide certain personal information, including 
one or more of the following: Name, Telephone Number, Fax Number, Mailing Address and E-mail Address. We will only forward a Supplier 
or Provider the contact information you provide.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to call the phone number listed on this website for a Supplier, your phone contact information, including such 
information as your Phone Number and your Name and Location, may be collected and provided to the Supplier. Additionally, the 
call may be monitored or recorded if a recorded message or other notification is provided at the beginning of the call to this 
effect, and the recording made available to the Supplier. THOMAS and its affiliates, agents, contractors or service providers may 
also monitor, store, review and access such information and call recordings and use them in connection with the provision of 
services to Suppliers or for business and marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, many Suppliers and Providers may make certain services, information and software applications, such as CAD Drawings 
or White Papers, available to the users of this website free of charge. Some of these Suppliers and Providers may require that you 
provide your contact and personal information in exchange for access to these services, information and applications. If you do not 
provide the required information, you will not be able to access these services, information and applications. Once information has 
been provided to a Supplier or Provider, it is out of the control of THOMAS and subject to the policies of that Supplier or Provider.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communications from THOMAS</strong>
</p>
<p>
By signing up for a MyThomas account and providing us with your e-mail address, you agree that THOMAS may communicate with you via 
e-mail concerning the services and operations of THOMAS and this website, including, but not limited to, confirmation, additions or 
deletions to services, notifications of product enhancements, notifications of service interruption and changes to this Privacy 
Statement, this website's <a href="/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> or other THOMAS policies. By default, 
users who sign up are "Opted Out" of and will not receive other communications from THOMAS unless they choose to. As part of the 
MyThomas sign up process, and at any time thereafter, you will have the opportunity to opt in to receive other communications, 
including newsletters and announcements, from THOMAS, its affiliates, Suppliers or Providers via e-mail by checking the appropriate 
boxes on the Sign Up/Update Form. All such communications from THOMAS will contain a link or instructions for opting out of future 
communications.  Please Note: To comply with the United States CAN-SPAM act, opting out from future communications from a company 
or entity will require that your e-mail address be given to that company or entity so that it may be added to the company's or 
entity's "do not mail" list.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Communications from Other Users </strong>
</p>
<p>
You agree that other users may use your Content posted on this website or other THOMAS services (whether on forums or other public 
areas) or obtained through a related communication or transaction to communicate with you in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Third Party Services</strong>
</p>
<p>
This website may offer services from or in conjunction with other websites, Suppliers or Providers that we feel provide valuable 
services to our users. Some of these services require registration. As a time saving tool, to save our users unnecessary data 
entry and to enhance the services offered, we offer to pass certain of your information, including your user profile, to these 
other websites, Suppliers and Providers. In addition, your use of any software applications, purchasing tools or other services 
labeled on this website as "Powered by" an entity other than THOMAS will constitute your consent to our sharing of information 
about you, including your personal information and user profile, with that entity. Once information has been shared with a particular 
website, Supplier or Provider, it is out of the control of THOMAS and subject to the policies of that website, Supplier or Provider. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>COOKIES</strong>
</p>
<p>
This website may set cookies on your computer. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your computer by our web server and helps recall

personalization or facilitate your movement through this website and measure site usage.
</p>
<p>
However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our website. These 
companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file.  Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain 
audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the 
audience they are trying to reach.  We only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous 
targeting.  These third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you.  
If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's 
Web site individually and opt-out (if they offer this capability). Currently, we have relationships with 
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline;">BBN Networks, Inc.</span>. If you would like to be opted-out of 
BBN ad delivery, audience management and behavioral targeting cookies, please

Additionally, You have the ability to control any website's ability to set cookies on your computer through your web browser's 
(i.e. Firefox or Internet Explorer) privacy settings. Consult the documentation or help files for your web browser for instructions on 
setting cookie preferences. However, if you do not accept cookies you will not be able to customize your experience on this website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>OTHER INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
</p>
<p>
Additionally, THOMAS may keep track of technical information about your computer or mobile device, such as the browser type and 
version, browser plug-in types and versions and operating system of your computer; the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or other 
provider you use to access this website, links on this website and certain of our services; and your internet protocol (IP) address, 
location and time zone setting. To help us understand the use of this website by users, improve your site experience and aid us in 
marketing and managing this website and our services, we may also collect information as to how you were directed to this website 
and our services, how you navigate around them, what products or suppliers you browse, which external websites or links you access 
from this website and details regarding the Suppliers or Providers you contact through this website. This information may be used, 
among other things, in the reporting, marketing and analysis of this website and its services and features and may be shared with our 
affiliates, Suppliers, Providers and/or their and our respective agents and contractors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>LOGGING</strong>
</p>
<p>
We make extensive use of web logging to, among other things, understand the usage of our services, diagnose problems and identify future 
enhancements to this website. In addition to logging the pages viewed and features used, our logs will also collect referring IP 
addresses or domain names of users. This information is used, among other things, in the reporting, marketing and analysis of this 
website and its services and features and may be shared with our affiliates, Suppliers, Providers and/or their and our respective 
agents and contractors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>WEB BEACONS</strong>
</p>
<p>
Pages on this website may contain web beacons, sometimes called single-pixel gifs, that allow us to count users who have visited certain 
pages. Web beacons may be used in conjunction with such features as promotional e-mail messages, online advertising and newsletters. Web 
beacons collect only a limited set of information and are not used to access your personal information on this website.
</p>
<p>
<strong>REPORTING OF INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
THOMAS is able to offer this website for free on the Internet as a direct result of the paid support of the Suppliers and Providers who 
provide information, applications and other services and advertise on this website. As a result, we provide these Suppliers and Providers 
with personal information as described above as well as aggregate information; we also provide them with reports of non-personally 
identifiable information collected on the usage of this website and various features, and information provided during the MyThomas sign 
up process, which may include information such as your company name, job function, industry or city.
</p>
<p>
<strong>OTHER WAYS WE MAY SHARE INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p>
It is possible that THOMAS, part of its business or one of its affiliates could merge with, acquire or be acquired by another business 
entity and your personal information could be among the assets transferred. If this occurs, you will be notified of the change by e-mail, 
notice on this website or one of our other services.
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to share personal information about you with our affiliates in the course of our business operations. We also reserve 
the right to share personal information about you when we believe this to be appropriate to comply with the law or in cooperation with 
legal authorities, to enforce the <a href="/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a> governing use of this website and the 
terms and conditions governing the use of 
our other services, or to protect the rights, property, safety or other interests of THOMAS, its affiliates or its customers.
</p>
<p>
We may share non-personal, non-individually identifiable information about our users with the group of people with whom we share personal 
information, as well as with other third parties such as agents, contractors, consultants, advertisers and marketing firms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>DATA SECURITY</strong>
</p>
<p>
We use reasonable precautions to keep user information disclosed to us secure. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and 
ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to 
safeguard and secure the information we collect.
</p>
<p>
We may disclose information we collect to third parties, under contract to us, as required to operate this website, provide certain 
services or features offered by this website or THOMAS or to perform business functions on our behalf. We will only release this information 
to those companies that we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any 
third parties who receive the information. Also, once information has been provided to a third party, it is out of the control of THOMAS 
and subject to the policies of that third party.
</p>
<p>
We also link to a wide variety of other websites. We are not responsible for their terms and conditions or privacy policies or how they 
collect or treat information about their users. In addition, we are not responsible for the terms and conditions or privacy or information 
collection policies or practices of the websites from which you access this website or other THOMAS service or of any websites that are 
linked to this website or other THOMAS service.
</p>
<p>

We reserve the right to modify or add to this Privacy Statement from time to time without notice. Such modifications and additions shall 
be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by any means, including without limitation by email to the e-mail address 
of record in your MyThomas user profile or by posting the revised Privacy Statement on this website. You agree that it shall be your
