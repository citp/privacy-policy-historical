###  **What Are Cookies?**

As well as being a yummy biscuit, a ‘cookie’ is a small file that can be stored on your computer. Thorntons uses cookies to provide features like auto-log-in and to determine when customers have previously visited our site. Our cookies do not contain any personal information about you, so only Thorntons will be able to use the cookies to determine your identity.

##  **Why we would like some information about you**

When you register on www.thorntons.co.uk, we ask for your full name and email address so we can contact you with our great chocolate offers and competitions. If you don’t want to receive these and other money off offers and competitions, it’s a simple process to say ‘no thanks. See the next section.

When you place an order for any product you first create a new user account at Thorntons.co.uk, we then collect your credit card billing address, credit card information, and telephone number, as well as the address details of the lucky person who’s about to receive your gift. We use this information to process your order and, if necessary, to contact you about your order.

Sometimes we ask for a little more information from you to make sure we only send offers that are relevant and really interesting to you. When its personal, it can be fun; you may be a secret treacle toffee fanatic, but not really like fudge, so we’ll try to make sure you only receive our stickiest, toffeeist emails!

You can always ask us what information we hold about you. Please contact us on 44 (0) 845 121 1911 if you wish to enquire about the data we hold and we’d be very happy to send this through to you. Remember there is a small fee. For more information on your rights, visit [the Information Commissioner’s website](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/raising-concerns/).

###  **‘No thanks, I don’t want to be contacted for promotional purposes’**

We want you to be comfortable with How, When and Why we contact you. It’s simple to choose. How would you like to tell us your preferences?

###  **Purchase History**

A record is kept of your purchases. Your previous orders may be used to present you with the most relevant products and gift ideas and to provide you with a better overall user experience.

###  **What is an IP address and how does Thorntons use them?**

An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when connected to the Internet. The servers that serve our web site automatically identify your computer by its IP address. This is used exclusively to highlight orders that appear abnormal, (i.e. Multiple credit card numbers being used) in order to identify the source of fraudulent orders.

###  **Are my personal messages private when I purchase gifts?**

When you add a personal message to an order, your message will be printed on a gift card that is part of the dispatch stationery. This is positioned so the message cannot be read during transit.

###  **What’s profiling?**

In order to develop our business we use some of the collected data including recipient details to profile you and your order profile. This data is used to improve our service to you and identify new customers who we should be marketing to. This involves passing information onto selected third party companies.

###  **Opting-in to emails**

To process your order on the Thorntons.co.uk site, we gather electronic mail information from you which we will use to send marketing communications from Thorntons (for example, text messages, emails and catalogues). Should you wish to opt-out at any time, simply call 0845 121 1911 or visit [www.thorntons.co.uk/unsubscribe](http://www.thorntons.co.uk/unsubscribe).

###  **Does Thorntons ensure the privacy practices of other sites to which it provides links?**

While we carefully select the websites to which we link, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites.

###  **How will I know when Thorntons.co.uk changes its privacy policy?**

Our privacy policy is regularly reviewed to make sure we continue to serve the privacy interests of our customers. We reserve the right to change and update the privacy policy and these changes will be posted on our web site. We encourage you to visit this page from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes we may have made.

###  **Sharing your information with other companies**

We do not disclose your information to third parties for marketing purposes.  We do share information with some companies, but they act for us under contract and must not use your information for any purpose that we have not agreed here.

Thorntons reserves the right to co-operate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our customers or relating to our customers. We will have no legal liability for such disclosures.
