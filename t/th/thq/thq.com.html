<p><b>THQ's Online Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.esrb.org/confirm/thq-confirmation.htm"><img src="/Assets/ESRB/ClickConf.gif" border="0" alt="ESRB - Click to confirm" align="right" width="76" height="105"></a>THQ Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively "THQ" or "we") respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and are committed to protecting the personal information collected about you. To further this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to guide how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us online.</p>
<p>This Privacy Statement and the certification seal located on this page confirm that THQ is a valid licensee and participating member in the <a href="http://www.esrb.org">Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Online Program: ESRB Privacy Online.</a> To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our websites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Online to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by ESRB Privacy Online.</p>
<p>Because the website you are currently visiting displays the ESRB Privacy Online certification seal, you can expect to be notified of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The scope of this Privacy Policy <br>
Exactly what information THQ may collect from you through its website(s) <br>
How THQ will use the information it collects <br>
What are the consequences if you refuse to divulge your personal information <br>
Whether THQ uses cookies or other passive collection tools on its website(s) <br>
Who collects the information that you disclose on a THQ website <br>
With whom, if anyone, does THQ share your personal information </li>
<li>	What choices you can make regarding how your personal information is used <br>

</ul>
<p><b>What does this Privacy Policy apply to?</b></p>
<p>The website you are currently visiting is operated by THQ located at 27001 Agoura Road, Suite 325, Calabasas, CA 91301. This Privacy Policy currently applies to the website(s) operated by THQ (collectively referred to as "THQ Websites" or "our Websites"). Please <a href="http://www.thq.com/policies/sites.asp">click here</a> to see a complete list of the applicable websites. In the future, if we wish to include additional websites under this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to include them in the list and ensure that they provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online through the THQ Websites (as listed above), and does <u>not</u> apply to information that may be collected by THQ offline. In addition, this Privacy Policy does <u>not</u> extend to websites maintained by our international affiliates (e.g., THQ Australia, THQ UK, THQ France, etc.) or other companies or organizations to which we link. Because we cannot guarantee that the privacy policies of such sites meet the requirements of the ESRB Privacy Online Program, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of the website to which you link before you submit any personal information to that site.</p>
<p><i>Please note that by using our Websites, you signify your assent to THQ's Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Websites. We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy.  <u>If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our Websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change.  </u>Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. Your continued use of our Websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.</i></p>
<p><b>What types of information does THQ collect?</b></p>
<p>In order to give you the best experience on our Websites, THQ may collect information about you, but only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Typically, we may ask you to submit personal and/or demographic information in connection with any one of the following features or services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Website and game-specific registration <br>
Newsletter subscription <br>
General support <br>
Product support <br>
Online store <br>
Contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions <br>
Polls, surveys, or questionnaires <br>
Message boards <br>
Other features such as e-cards, wish lists, and tell-a-friend </li>
</ul>
<p>The types and amount of personal information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity. The requested personal information may include: your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address and (for those purchasing products online) credit card information including billing and shipping addresses. For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and to provide other non-personal information such as your age or date of birth, gender, game and platform preferences (including information about the games and hardware you own), hobbies and interests, and other information (also known as "demographic information"). If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. Combining data allows us to customize the notices we send you and the services we provide you according to your interests and preferences. For more on how we use your information, please read the section on use below.</p>
<p>No matter what method we use to collect information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>
<p><b>How does THQ use the information it collects?</b></p>
<p>Generally, information that we collect for a particular purpose is used for that purpose only. For example, if you request product support, the email address that you provide will only be used for purposes of diagnosing your specific technical problem and providing an acceptable solution. Information collected from those who register on our Websites is used to provide registrants the benefits associated with such registration (e.g., subscription to newsletter or access to the latest game news and exclusive store promotions). And, of course, any credit card information is solely used to fulfill and process purchase orders. In some instances, however, you may also be given the option to have your information used for an activity or service different from the activity or service that you are requesting (e.g., to have your name entered into a contest when subscribing to our newsletter or vice versa). If you choose to receive these additional services, THQ will use your information to provide them to you.</p>
<p>We may use your email address to send you service-related announcements that tell you about updates to our Privacy Policy, new areas or features on our Websites, changes to our online service or technical support policies, and other related changes.</p>
<p>We may also use your personal and demographic information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online products and services we provide you and to better meet your needs.</p>
<p>Please be advised that in some areas of our Websites, you may be able to submit information about yourself in a business capacity. Although we can assure you that any personal information gathered in this context will be used solely for its intended purpose, such information is not subject to this Privacy Policy. These areas typically include an employment section where you can submit your resume online and/or an investors relations section where you can fill out an online form to request financial information about our THQ.</p>
<p><b>What happens if I refuse to provide my personal information to THQ?</b></p>
<p>If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on our Websites and may limit the services we can provide you. For example, if you refuse to share your email address, you may not be able to receive general support or product support. To simply browse our Websites, however, you do not need to give us any personal information.</p>
<p><b>Does THQ use cookies, track IP addresses, or use other passive means to collect information?</b></p>
<p><u>Cookies</u></p>
<p>We may use cookies to improve the use and functionality of our Websites. A "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often store on a user's computer. Storage of cookies on your system provides an easy and convenient method for us to personalize your experience on our Websites. For example, cookies will remember what you've placed in your shopping cart, tell us that you have visited one of our Websites before, and may contain other information that will make your next visit to our Websites more enjoyable. We may combine information contained in cookies with your personal information. You can always disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to shop online, both at THQ and elsewhere.</p>
<p><u>Web Beacons</u></p>
<p>We may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our Websites or include them in the e-mail messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as "web bugs") are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. We use web beacons for many purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization. Information gathered through web beacons may be linked to your personal information.</p>
<p><u>IP Addresses</u></p>
<p>THQ may also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to troubleshoot technical concerns and to maintain website safety and security. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.</p>
<p><u>Log Files</u></p>
<p>THQ may collect information in the form of logs - files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help THQ determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our Websites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data (a.k.a., navigational data). We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.</p>
<p><b>Who is collecting my personal information and is it shared with anyone?</b></p>
<p>The information that you disclose on the THQ Websites is collected by THQ or by a vendor on THQ's behalf; and, is used in accordance with the practices set forth above. Vendors (or agents) are entities that provide support for the internal operations of our Websites and who only use the information we share with them (or that they collect on our behalf) for purposes of internal fulfillment (e.g., online product fulfillment). Vendors are required to handle such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may run contests, tournaments, or other events or activities ("events") on our Websites. Information collected for these events may include personal information such as your email address and may be collected by or shared with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other reputable third party (e.g., promotional partner, software licensee, or game developer). While we have no control over the third party's use of such information, we will attempt to ensure that they agree to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of any personal information we share with them (or that they collect through our Websites). If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these events at the time the information is collected.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, THQ's customer information may be transferred to our successor or assign.</p>
<p><b>Can I choose how my personal information is used?</b></p>
<p>If you do not want to receive our newsletter, service related announcements, or any other communications and/or services from THQ, please opt-out from these communications or services at the time of registration or information collection. If you have opted-in and, at a later time, wish to opt-out, please visit the appropriate "Profile" section on our Websites or contact us using the information provided below.</p>
<p><b>How can I access my personal information?</b></p>
<p>If you wish to review, update, or delete any personal information that we may have collected about you, please visit the appropriate "Profile" section on our Websites or contact us using the information provided below.</p>
<p><b>What is THQ's policy regarding children under 13?</b></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information such as name and email address from children under 13 years old on our Websites. We take steps to ensure that those who wish to register or submit personal information on our Websites meet certain age requirements before they can do so. We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly.</p>
<p>From time to time, certain portions of the THQ Websites may allow children under 13 to disclose a limited amount of personal information without first telling us their age or getting their parent's permission. Such portions of our Websites operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent.</p>
<p><b>What safeguards does THQ use to protect my personal information?</b></p>
<p>THQ takes reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from our website visitors. Personal information collected by THQ is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized employees. In addition, our online store uses industry-standard encryption to prevent unauthorized electronic access to sensitive financial information such as your credit card number. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. For example, before we allow web users to access their personal information, we verify their identity by requesting information such as their username and password.</p>
<p>Although we cannot guarantee that third parties to whom we transfer personal data will adhere to the security standards set forth above, we will take reasonable measures to assure that they provide sufficient protection over such data.</p>
<p><b>How do I ask a question or file a complaint? (Contact Information)</b></p>
<p>If you have any questions, complaints, or comments regarding this Privacy Policy or our information collection practices, please contact our Privacy Policy Administrator at:</p>
