# Privacy Policy - Thrifty Jinxy

## Privacy Policy:

Thrifty Jinxy (" **Thrifty Jinxy** ") operates ThriftyJinxy.com and may operate other websites. It is Thrifty Jinxy's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Thrifty Jinxy collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Thrifty Jinxy's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Thrifty Jinxy's visitors use its website. From time to time, Thrifty Jinxy may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Thrifty Jinxy also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on ThriftyJinxy.com blogs/sites. Thrifty Jinxy only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Thrifty Jinxy's websites choose to interact with Thrifty Jinxy in ways that require Thrifty Jinxy to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Thrifty Jinxy gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at [ThriftyJinxy.com](http://thriftyjinxy.com/) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Thrifty Jinxy are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Thrifty Jinxy collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Thrifty Jinxy. Thrifty Jinxy does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Thrifty Jinxy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Thrifty Jinxy's behalf or to provide services available at Thrifty Jinxy's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Thrifty Jinxy's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Thrifty Jinxy will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Thrifty Jinxy discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Thrifty Jinxy believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Thrifty Jinxy, third parties or the public at large.
