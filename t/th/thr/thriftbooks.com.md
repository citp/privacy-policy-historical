Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you. 
    2. **When you request more information about an item** , ThriftBooks collects your email address or phone number or both, so that we can respond to your request.

We are not responsible for the terms of the breach of any agreement between you and any third party marketplace, and your personal information is subject to their policies and ours. 
  2. **Email messages from ThriftBooks**

  3. **How we protect your information**

In all of our Services, we have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server layer (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. All of the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access. That being said, no measures are guaranteed to be 100% secure. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your device and account, including to (1) choose a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and (2) keep your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

  6. **Processing grounds**

    1. **Contractual necessity**

We process some personal information because we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you with the ThriftBooks Services (as defined in the Conditions of Use). When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such personal information will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data. 

    2. **Legitimate interest**

We may process personal information when we believe doing so furthers our legitimate interest. Our legitimate interests may include operation and improvement of the Services; marketing the Services; provision of customer support; protection from fraud or security threats; completion of corporate transactions; and compliance with legal obligations. 

    3. **Consent**

In some cases, we process personal information based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process personal information based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection. To withdraw your consent, please email us at [support@thriftbooks.com](mailto:support@thriftbooks.com). 

    4. **Other processing grounds**

From time to time we may also need to process personal information to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest. 

  7. **Data retention**

We keep the data we collect for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data was collected, to perform our contractual and legal obligations, and for any applicable statute of limitations periods for the purposes of bringing and defending claims. 

  8. **Rights you have with regard to your data**

You have certain rights with respect to your personal information, and we want to help you review and update your information to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date. We may limit or reject your request in certain cases, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, if it is not required by law, or if the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question. In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include personal information, to verify your identity and the nature of your request. We will take reasonable steps to respond to all requests within 30 days. 

If you wish to exercise any of the following rights, you may do so by contacting us at [support@thriftbooks.com](mailto:support@thriftbooks.com):
