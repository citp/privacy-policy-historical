# Privacy Policy | New & Used Books from Thrift Books

## Your privacy matters to us

Welcome to ThriftBooks. Because we are committed to protecting your privacy in all aspects of our business, we hope you will take the time to read this policy, which explains what information we collect from you and how we use that information. By using any websites, products, or services that we provide, you agree to be bound by this policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it. Please check back periodically.

## What information we collect and how we use it

When you visit any of our websites, including [Thriftbooks.com](https://www.thriftbooks.com/) and [BookClubHub.com](https://www.bookclubhub.com/), ThriftBooks collects your IP address, device type, and browser information, which we use to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our websites, and to improve our products and services. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you.

To request more information about an item, you must provide your email address so that the seller may reply to your question by email.

To order from us or use other ThriftBooks Services (as defined in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/conditionofuse.aspx)), you must set up a ThriftBooks account. Setting up an account requires you to provide your email address and to choose a password (your "Account Information"). When you order from us, we also ask for your name, shipping address, telephone number, and credit card number, billing address, and expiration date (your "Order Information"). This information is necessary for us to process your order, to notify you of your order status, and to fulfill orders. We do not save your credit card information unless you check the box asking us to.

_Email messages from ThriftBooks_ \- If you create a ThriftBooks account, ThriftBooks may send to you email or other communications containing information about ThriftBooks and other matters ThriftBooks believes will interest you. At any time you may alter your communications preferences by logging into your account and choosing which email communications you want to receive in your [Email Preferences](https://web.archive.org/Account/AccountDetails.aspx). Also, each email ThriftBooks sends to you will tell you how to decline further unsolicited email. From time to time, ThriftBooks may also send you email containing important information regarding the website, which you may not opt out of receiving.

Thriftbooks.com and the ThriftBooks App use the Clicktale customer experience analytics service. The Clicktale service helps us analyze how visitors use our Website. We do not collect through the Clicktale service or transfer to Clicktale any personal identifiable information. We only use the Clicktale service to record, on a completely anonymous basis, information such as mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as non-Personally Identifiable Information text you type in this website. Clicktale does not create a user profile for the purpose of tracking a user across unrelated web sites and will only use such information pursuant to its Privacy Policy (located at <http://www.clicktale.com/company/privacy-service>). You can choose to disable the Clicktale service at <http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html>. 

## How we protect your information

In all of our website, products, and services, we have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server layer (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. All of the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access.

## When we may disclose your information

ThriftBooks may disclose your personal information in the following circumstances and as otherwise permitted by applicable law:

  1. _Disclosure to Authorizing Persons_ \- If you use our websites, products, or services on behalf of another person or organization (such as your employer), ThriftBooks may provide your personal information to that authorizing person/organization. ThriftBooks has no control over the use of your personal information by the authorizing person/organization, and that use is not subject to this Policy. If you do not wish your personal information to be disclosed to the person/organization on whose behalf you use our websites, products, and services, you may not use our websites, products, and services.
  2. _Disclosure to Affiliates, Booksellers, Suppliers, and Service Providers_ \- ThriftBooks may provide your personal information to its affiliated businesses or other suppliers and service providers for use in connection with the operation of our websites, products, and services. For example, ThriftBooks discloses certain of your personal information to your credit card provider and the shipping company in order to facilitate the purchase of books through its websites, products, and services. ThriftBooks may also disclose certain of your personal information to service providers that analyze website or other product use. ThriftBooks requires its affiliated businesses, suppliers, and service providers to agree to use your personal information only for the purposes for which it is provided to them, and to protect the privacy of your personal information in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. Otherwise, if you do not wish your personal information to be disclosed to ThriftBooks’ affiliated businesses, booksellers, suppliers, and service providers, you may not create a ThriftBooks account or order books through our websites or otherwise use our products and services.
  3. _Disclosure in Business Transfers_ \- ThriftBooks may be involved in the sale or transfer of some or all of its business. As part of that sale or transfer, ThriftBooks may disclose your personal information to the acquiring organization, but will require the acquiring organization to agree to protect the privacy of your personal information in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. ThriftBooks has no liability for the acquiring organization’s use and disclosure of your personal information.
  4. _Law Enforcement and Legal Disclosure_ \- ThriftBooks may disclose your personal information to a government institution that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the information or where ThriftBooks has reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful in the investigation of unlawful activity, or to comply with a subpoena or warrant or an order made by a court, person, or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to comply with court rules regarding the production of records and information, or to its legal counsel. ThriftBooks has no control over, or liability for, those persons’ use and disclosure of your personal information, and that use and disclosure is not subject to this Policy.



ThriftBooks may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related website and product information to third parties, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Put simply, we will not tell our business partners that you bought a particular item, but we may tell them how many customers in certain demographic groups bought certain items.

## Links to other websites

The ThriftBooks website and products contain links to other sites, operated by third parties, that we think may be of interest to you. ThriftBooks encourages third parties to follow appropriate privacy standards and policies, but is not responsible for the actions of those parties, the content of their websites, or any products or services they may offer.

## Cookies

The ThriftBooks website uses "cookies," which are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide a shopping cart and to store your shipping and billing information between visits. If you've set your browser to reject cookies, you can still use our site, but will not be able to purchase items. Cookies may also be used by our affiliates or advertisers. ThriftBooks encourages anyone who uses cookies to follow appropriate privacy standards and policies, but is not responsible for cookies placed by third parties.

## Children's privacy online

At ThriftBooks, we understand that children's privacy is important. Except in connection with surveys and contests, we do not monitor the age of our user audience. However, if you are under age 13, you should not submit personal identifying information to ThriftBooks without the consent of your parent or guardian. If you are a parent and want to limit your children's access to material you believe may be harmful to them, you may want to look into commercially available hardware, software, and filtering devices. If you are interested in learning about these protections, information is available at <http://www.google.com/search?q=internet+filters> and other similar sites.
