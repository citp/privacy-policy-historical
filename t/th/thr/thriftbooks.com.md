What information we collect and how we use it  
  
When you visit our Web site, Thrift Books collects your IP address, which we use to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to improve our products and services. Your IP address also is used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you.

To order from us, you must set up a Thrift Books account. Setting up an account requires you to provide your e-mail address and to choose a password (your "Account Information"). When you order from us, we also ask for your name, shipping address, telephone number, and your credit card number, billing address, and expiration date (your "Order Information"). This information is necessary for us to process your order, to notify you of your order status, and to fulfill orders.We do not save your credit card info unless you check the box asking us to.

E-mails from Thrift Books - If you register as a Thrift Books customer, then Thrift Books may send to you, from time to time, e-mail or other communications containing information about Thrift Books and other matters Thrift Books believes will interest you.
