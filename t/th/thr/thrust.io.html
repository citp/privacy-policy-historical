        <div class="well">
            <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally
                identifiable information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information
                security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or
                locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy
                carefully to
                get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally

            <h2>How do we protect visitor information?</h2>

            <p>
                We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.
                We use regular Malware Scanning.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited
                number of
                persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information
                confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket
                Layer
                (SSL) technology.
            </p>

            <p>
                We implement a variety of security measures when a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses
                their
                information to maintain the safety of your personal information.
            </p>

            <p>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our
                servers.</p>

            <h2>Do we use 'cookies'?</h2>

            <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive
                through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to
                recognize
                your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us
                remember
                and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences
                based
                on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also
                use
                cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer
                better site experiences and tools in the future.
            </p>


            <h3>We use cookies to:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.
                </li>
                <li>Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.
                </li>
                <li>Keep track of advertisements.
                </li>
                <li>Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site
                    experiences and
                    tools in the future. We may also use trusted third party services that track this information on our
                    behalf.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn
                off
                all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a
                little
                different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

            <h3>If users disable cookies in their browser:</h3>

            <p>If you disable cookies off, some features will be disabled It will turn off some of the features that
                make
                your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</p>

            <p>However, you can still place orders by contacting customer service.</p>

            <h2>Third Party Disclosure</h2>

            <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable
                information.</p>

            <h2>Third party links</h2>

            <p>
                Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our
                website.
                These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no
                responsibility
                or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the
                integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

            <h2>Google</h2>

            <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in
                place
                to provide a positive experience for users.
                https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</p>

            <p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>

            <p>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie
                enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.
                Users
                may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy
                policy.</p>


            <h3>We have implemented the following:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Demographics and Interests Reporting</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics
                cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers
                together
                to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions, and other ad service functions as they
                relate to our website.</p>

            <p>Opting out:
                Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page.
                Alternatively,
                you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising initiative opt out page or permanently using the
                Google
                Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.</p>

            <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
                privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
                United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable
                information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
                exactly
                the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with
                this
                policy. - See more at:
                http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

            <h3>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h3>

            <p>Users can visit our site anonymously<br>
                Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the
                first
                significant page after entering our website.<br>
                Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified
                above.
            </p>

            <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page
                and are able to change their personal information by emailing us</p>

            <h2>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h2>

            <p>We don't honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not
                Track
                (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. We don't honor them because:
                it would significantly compromise the user experience.</p>

            <h2>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h2>

            <p>It's also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking</p>

            <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online
                Privacy
                Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer
                protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
                services
                must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
            </p>

            <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

            <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>

            <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
                concepts
                they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
                Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
                comply
                with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

            <h2>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                should
                a
                data breach occur:</h2>

            <p>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days</p>

            <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue
                legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
                principle
                requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
                have
                recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
                processors.</p>

            <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>

            <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for
                commercial
                messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out
                tough
                penalties for violations.</p>

            <h3>We collect your email address in order to:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
                <li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders</li>
                <li>We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li>
                <li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction
                    has
                    occurred
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</li>
                <li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</li>
                <li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li>
                <li>Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
                <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li>
                <li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can follow the
                instructions at
                the bottom of each email.</p>
