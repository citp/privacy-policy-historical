The policies below are applicable to and other Internet services connected to the Internet operated by Next New Networks (the "Sites").

We can be reached via e-mail at [hi@nextnewnetworks.com](mailto:hi@nextnewnetworks.com).

Your enjoyment of the site is important to us. We want to make things easy and simple. As part of the operation of the Sites, we gather certain types of information about our visitors, and we would like to explain the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how to correct or change the information.

## Information Collected

The Sites collect two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and e-mail addresses) that make it easy for you to participate; and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns and other general usage).

## Personal Data

Personal data is collected and stored when you provide personal data on the site, for example in uploading videos, posting messages in forums or in the video comments section, in answering surveys, purchasing items from us, and registering for contests and other promotional opportunities provided by us. Also, we collect the e-mail addresses and screen names of users who post messages to our message boards and chat areas. When you type personal data in a web page, we collect and keep it.

We allow users who have provided personal data access to their information to ensure that it is correct and to make any changes and or to delete it by contacting us at the email address set forth above. To facilitate your access to our Sites, we use Facebook Platform. When you log in to our Sites from www.facebook.com  , we may receive personal and anonymous information about you such as your name, email address and other information you provide to Facebook. Because we use Facebook Platform, we are subject to certain requirements of Facebook which you can find here: <http://www.facebook.com/terms.php>

Please note that:

  * When you post a message on any Site, you may have the ability to post a message that may include personally identifiable information about yourself.
  * Any posting made while using any Site is not considered "personal data" and is not considered the type of information protected by a privacy policy.
  * If you post contact information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 



## Aggregated Information

Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, the Sites log IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address, and when you request a page from any Site, our servers log your IP address.

To learn more about IP addresses and how they work, please visit [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) on Wikipedia.

IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, LEGAL AUTHORITIES MAY TREAT IP ADDRESSES AS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. BY YOUR USAGE OF OUR SERVICES, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THE FOREGOING NOTICE AND CONSENT AND OPT-IN TO OUR COLLECTION OF YOUR IP ADDRESS PER THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN.

## Cookies and Tracking Devices

Our Sites may use cookies or other tracking devices. Cookies do not allow the website to access personal information that you have not already provided. You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of this Site. However, you may find that some areas on the Site will be slower, or may not function at all.

For more information about cookies, please visit [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) on Wikipedia.

You may occasionally get cookies or other tracking devices from our advertisers. We do not control these devices, and these devices are not subject to our privacy policies.

## Use of Information Collected by Us

Our Sites will never, ever, under any circumstances sell your Personal Data. The information is used to make your time spent with us more enjoyable, improve the content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Site for each individual user and to notify users about updates to the Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you.

We may, however, share information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes. In some situations, we will share your personal information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails or conducting retail transactions. This and other sites may be sold or transferred to another entity. Should such an event occur, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

We may post the screen name of a user (for example, to identify a contest winner or a user submitting content) on our Sites.

Our Sites may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our sites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our sites and to other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, we may share Web site usage information about visitors to our Sites, with such company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on our Sites, but we will never share your personal data with an advertiser.

## Children and Privacy

## Children under the age of 13

Because the Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, we do not provide memberships or registration to persons under age 13. Prospective users under the age of 13 may not create an account on the Site, may not sign up for any subscription service or buy anything through the Site, and are not eligible to enter any of our sweepstakes or promotions. Except as may be required by law, we will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any personal information from children under the age of 13.

## Children between the ages of 13 and 18

If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, please let your parent or guardian know that you are spending time here. We also advise you to share this Privacy Policy with them and get their permission before you give us any of your personal data, before you interact with any other users, and before you buy anything from any Site. Do not post your real name on a web site or message board, and never tell anyone online anything private about yourself or your family, including your phone number and address. If you win a sweepstakes that has a prize, your parent or guardian will have to mail or fax us a signed note at the address or fax number listed in the rules for the specific contest that says it was OK for you to enter, and tells us they will accept the prize for you. Some areas of the Site may have special rules for children under the age of 18. When you are in those areas, you must follow those rules.

## Information for Parents/Guardians

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the internet. Parents and guardians should regularly oversee their children's use of e-mail and other online communications and transactional features. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers that can help provide a safe online environment for kids.

If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her personal information without your permission or consent, we will take reasonable steps to promptly remove that information from our database at your request. To request removal of your child's information, please send an e-mail to us at the email address at the beginning of this Privacy Policy and be sure to include in your message the same user name, password, and email address that your child submitted.

## Additional Information

The Sites may contain links to other sites that you may access. These other sites should have their own privacy policies and you should review those policies before following those links. We cannot control the information disclosed at these third-party sites or how that information is used. If you've made it this far reading our privacy policy, you're probably gonna read their policy, too. That's a good thing.

No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE, SHALL ANY SITE OR NEXT NEW NETWORKS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF INFORMATION OR MATERIALS ON OUR SITES, EVEN IF WE OR AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF OURS, HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS SECTION ALSO SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FULL [TERMS OF USE](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_use).

You should be aware that the United States and other countries have not harmonized their privacy regulations. Because our Sites are intended specifically for users in the United States, we have written our Privacy Policy to satisfy United States regulations. By using any Site, you agree to the level of privacy protection set out in our Privacy Policy.

## USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE PRIVACY POLICY.

The issue of privacy is an evolving one. We are committed to the constant monitoring and examination of our privacy practices, and may, from time to time, institute changes to our Privacy Policy. In the event that any material changes are made to our privacy practices, we will promptly make changes to this Privacy Policy that reflect such changes; therefore we recommend you review our policy regularly to check for updates. You can send e-mail to us with any further questions at the email address at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.

_This Privacy Policy was last updated and is effective as of June 27, 2007._
