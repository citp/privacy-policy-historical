# Privacy Policy - Three

3 will always protect and maintain your privacy. This Policy outlines how we collect, store, use and disclose the personal information that you provide us with.

This Policy also confirms 3’s obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 (including the National Privacy Principles), and the Telecommunications Act 1997.

**Why do we collect personal information?**  
3 is required to collect certain details of your personal information in order to provide you with telecommunication services and products (including mobile phones and broadband).

  * When you visit our website, online store, Facebook page and other pages that we own and manage;
  * When you visit external pages through our portals like Planet 3;
  * During recordings of call made when you contact 3. These calls may be recorded for training, quality and business purposes; and

  * We may also collect information by other means and will take all reasonable steps to inform you if and when we do.

The personal information we collect may be used for a number of purposes related to providing you with better mobile phone and broadband services including:

For other purposes, 3 will obtain your consent to use your personal information.




**How to opt-out of marketing materials**

  * Any other person or for any other purposes that would be reasonably expected.

We are required by law to disclose certain personal information about you (including your name, address, telephone number and address) to the operator of the Integrated Public Number Database (IPND). Personal information in the IPND is used to assist emergency services and safeguard national security. If you consent, information from the IPND may also be published in public directories or used by directory assistance.




**How accurate is the personal information we hold about you?**  
We take all reasonable measures to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. However, the accuracy of your information is largely dependent on what you provide us. To ensure that we have your most current and accurate personal information, please contact us when your information changes (e.g. if you change your name or move house).

**What security measures do we use to protect your personal information?**  
The security of your personal information is given a high priority. We take all reasonable steps to securely store your personal information so that it is protected from unauthorised use, access, modification or disclosure. This includes both physical and electronic security measures.

**Protecting your account from unauthorised access**  
Anyone who knows your account PIN or online username and password can access your account. You must keep your PIN, username and password secure and only share these details with people you authorise to access and manage your 3 account. 3 accepts no responsibility for information disclosed to parties who know your PIN, username or password.
