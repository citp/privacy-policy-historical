        visitors to our site. Please take a moment to read the following policy, 
        which describes our privacy practices.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="headline1">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</span><br>
        Most of the content and services on our site are available without our 
        collection of any personal information from you. However, in some areas 
        of the site we may request personal information from visitors such as 
        name, home address, e-mail address, age, interests and gender. We may 
        collect this information when you register for a newsletter, complete 
        a survey, purchase a product, or inquire about our services.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy1">In addition, some information may automatically be 
        collected by our web servers as you browse our site. Our web server automatically 
        collects information known as "clickstream data," such as the 
        domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, the Internet 
        protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your 
        browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time 
        spent on our site, pages viewed, information searched for, access times 
        and other relevant statistics. We also use cookies on our site. Cookies

        <span class="headline1">USE OF INFORMATION</span><br>
        We use your personal information in a limited number of ways. We use the 
        information to complete transactions, to respond to your requests, and 
        to identify persons participating in interactive portions of our site 
        if they are provided, such as chat rooms. We use information collected 
        to send you e-mail updates and newsletters about our sites and to notify 
        you if you've won a game or contest. We may share the information with 
        our affiliates. We also may use the information you provide to send you 
        e-mail promotions and special offers from reputable third parties in whose 
        products and services we think you may have an interest. And we may share 
        your information with reputable third-parties in whose products and services 
        we think you may have an interest, who may contact you directly.<br>
        <br>
        We use clickstream data and cookies in the aggregate to measure the use 
        of our site and to administer and improve our site. When we collect personal 
        information, we may extract some of the information and combine it with 
        other information, such as clickstream data. This combined information 
        is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand 
        trends and patterns. None of this combined information is reviewed at 
        an individual level.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy1">To the extent required or permitted by law, we may 
        also collect, use and disclose personal information in connection with 
        security-related or law enforcement investigations or in the course of 
        cooperating with authorities or complying with legal requirements. We 
        may also use your information as permitted by law to perform credit checks, 
        report or collect debts owed, or protect our rights or property, our website, 
        or its users.<br>

        from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use and 
        we periodically review our security measures.<br>
