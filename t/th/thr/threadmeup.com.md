# Privacy Policy - ThreadMeUp

**Last Updated: 02/16/2016**

ThreadMeUp knows that privacy is important, so we are providing this Privacy Policy to communicate our policies with respect to your information when you use our website located at www.threadmeup.com (the “Website”) or any service made available through the Website (together with the Website, the “Services”). Any defined terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the Terms of Use located at <https://www.threadmeup.com/terms>. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates.

## Information Collection and Use

**Information You Give Us.** While you may browse certain portions of the Website without registration, the Services require you to create an account. We refer to information that can personally identify you, such as your name and email address, as “Personal Information”. We may use your Personal Information to provide the Services to you (including contacting you regarding billing) and to contact you to notify you of (a) new services or products you may be interested in, which may include new Movements by a Creator you have purchased Goods from previously, (b) changes to the Services, or (b) third-party services that may be of interest to you. Except as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose your Personal Information to third parties.

**Usage Information.** We collect non-personal statistical information that does not individually identify you. It includes non-personal statistical information about your internet connection, the equipment that you use to access our Services, and how you use our Services. We refer to this information as “Usage Information”. This information allows us to optimize the Services to the internet connections and equipment that are used to visit our website. For instance, we may collect information on how long you use the Services, on whether you have used the Services before and on how many occasions, how frequently you use the Services, and at what points you exit the Services to make the Services better. We collect this information both directly from you when you provide it to us and automatically as you navigate through and interact with our Services, including (i) details of your visits to our Services, including traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Website and (ii) information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type. The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

  * **Cookies (or browser cookies).** A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. We use session cookies to keep track of your login information. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Services. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you use the Services.
  * **Pixel Tags / Web Beacons.** Pages of our website and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs. pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email. We may also use these web beacons for other related Website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain content and verifying system and server integrity).
  * **Device identifiers.** When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Services, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us.



## Third-party Service Providers

We use third-party Service Providers in order to efficiently provide our Services to you. Service Providers perform tasks including, but not limited to, printing and fulfillment of orders and credit card payment processing. Some Service Providers will collect information directly from you and provide us with relevant data (such as credit card processing companies). We may use this information to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into (for instance, to collect any authorized fees). Information collected from these third-party services is governed by their privacy policies. You should view the privacy policies of Service Providers before providing information to them. Even though we do not disclose your Personal Information for these purposes without your consent, if you interact with a third party, the third party may have access to your Personal Information.

## Sharing Information

We may disclose Usage Information and aggregated information about our users (that cannot personally identify any person) without restriction. We do not disclose your Personal Information except in the circumstances described here:

  * **Your Consent:** We may share or disclose your Personal Information at your direction in connection with your use of the Services.
