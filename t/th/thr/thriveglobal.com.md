# Privacy Policy - Thrive Global - Thrive Global

Welcome to Thrive Global Holdings Inc. ( **“Thrive”** ,  **“we”** ,  **“us”**  and/or  **“our”** ). Our mobile application ( **“App”** ) helps users ( **“Users,”**   **“you,”**  or  **“your”** ) take back control of your time by giving you tools to set boundaries with technology so you can connect more deeply with yourself and others. Our website ( **“Site”** ) also allows you to easily access and use content, including features, resources and other information intended to help you change the way you live and work. Collectively, the services we provide through the Site and the App are defined as the  **“Service(s)”**.

This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect through the App and the Site, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices. This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms and Conditions Agreement, which are available at <https://www.thriveglobal.com/thrive/terms>.

By providing us with your personal data when using the Services, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the Services.

This Privacy Policy also explains what personal data we collect from Thrive’s enterprise customers ( **“Customers”** ) and how we use and share that data. Where we provide the Services under contract with our Customers, that Customer controls the personal data submitted to the Services. In this Privacy Policy we refer to the data we process on behalf of Customers as  **“Service Data”**. Our use of Service Data is governed by our contract with the specific Customer and the Customer’s own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or privacy practices of Customers or other third parties. For more information, please see the Service Data section below.

Thrive complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks ( **“Frameworks”** ) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal data transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. (for these purposes, reference to the EU also includes the European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Thrive has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the EU or Swiss Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Frameworks and to view our certification page, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

**Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation.**  We take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, and that it is accurate, complete and current for as long as we retain it. Our data retention practices are described in the Data Retention section of this Privacy Policy.

**Access.  **You have certain rights to access, correct, amend, or delete Personal Data where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles.
