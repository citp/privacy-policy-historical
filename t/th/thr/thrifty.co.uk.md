# Privacy Policy - Thrifty Car Rental

**Introduction**

Thrifty Car and Van Rental is dedicated to protecting its customers privacy and their personal information. This privacy statement explains the processes around what data we collect about you, how it is obtained, what it will be used for and who will access it. 

Thrifty as a data controller is committed to ensuring that all personal information is processed in line with the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), the information security requirements of ISO27001 and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) throughout the information lifecycle – collection to deletion/destruction. 

This privacy statement applies to the information held about you that can be used to identify you as an individual, known as personal information. Personal information includes, but is not limited to, your name, IP address, home addresses, telephone number, email address, payment card or other billing information, driver licence details. By providing personal information to Thrifty, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of this privacy statement and the subsequent processing of your personal information in accordance with this statement. 

**Collecting your Personal Information**

When booking a vehicle rental or registering for an account on Thrifty.co.uk, Thrifty will require your personal information such as, your name, home address, telephone number, email address and payment card details. This allows Thrifty to process your booking, to contact you if we have any problems with your request or to send you an electronic confirmation of any quotes obtained or confirmation of bookings made. This information is shared with our Thrifty site locations and associated teams who will process your booking, source your requested vehicle and process your payment. If your personal information is going to be shared with any Third Party for any other reason than to fulfil the contract of the vehicle rental which is Thrifty's legal basis for processing your data, we will ask you for your explicit consent. 

If you pay for your rental at the time of booking you will be asked to enter your payment card type, long card number and expiration date to enable Thrifty to take your payment. Thrifty use 'tokenisation' which is when the customer's long card number is replaced with a series of randomly-generated numbers, which is called the 'token.' These tokens can then be passed through the internet or the various wireless networks needed to process the payment without actual bank details being exposed. 

To enable the booking to take place Thrifty will ask the for customer for identification and make a photocopy, this can include a passport, driver's license, utility bill or a credit/debit card statement (long card number will be covered so the details are not copied). This information will only be kept for the purpose of that individual rental and securely disposed of when no longer needed for that rental agreement. 

Without the above information being provided Thrifty will not be able to authorise the vehicle rental to take place.
