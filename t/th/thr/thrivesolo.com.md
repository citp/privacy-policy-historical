INFORMATION SHARING
Solo does not hand over personal information to third parties or
use it in any non-related matter, as long as we do not have your
written permission to do so (e.g. per e-mail) or are forced to do
so by law.
COOKIES
Solo uses cookies – small files containing a string of characters.
We use cookies to improve the quality and usability of our service.
Most of the cookies used by Solo are so-called session cookies:
they will be deleted after your session automatically. Solo also
uses cookies to identify a user during a session, so the user does
not have to log in on any personalized site again and again.
You can force your browser to block cookies in your browser
settings, but we do not recommend that: some features might
not be usable anymore.
