##### 9\. Your Data Subject Rights

9.1 Summary. This section summarizes your rights with regard to your Personal Data under certain Data Protection Laws (“Data Subject Rights”). These rights are complex and not all relevant details are included here. You should read the relevant laws and the available guidance from the relevant regulatory authorities and review recent cases interpreting those requirements in order to fully understand the scope and applicability of these Data Subject Rights.

9.2 When Data Rights Do Not Apply. These Data Subject Rights only apply to the extent that the Personal Data retains its character as Personal Data. Even then, certain Data Subject Rights are overridden by the legal basis upon which the Processing occurs. These Data Subject Rights do not apply to the extent that the Personal Data under consideration is governed by our Legitimate Interests as described in Section 10.2 override and outweigh the applicability of such Data Rights.

9.3 Data Subject Rights Described. Your principal rights to Personal Data include, when and as applicable, the following. The following is a general statement of potential Data Subject Rights and does not imply that all such rights exist in all cases or as to all users. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at the email address located on the last page of this policy:

(a) _  The Right of Access._ You have a right to have access to the Personal Data we hold about you and to verify that we are using your Personal Data lawfully. If asked, we will provide confirmation of what Personal Data we hold, together with certain additional information such as the purposes of the Processing, the categories of Personal Data concerned and the recipients of the Personal Data. Provided that our rights and interests or the rights and interests of others are not affected, we will supply you with a copy of your Personal Data or inform you of the rights you may have with regard thereto.

(b)  _The Right of Rectification._ You have the right to have any Personal Data held about you which is inaccurate to be rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the Processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.

(c)  _The Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)_. In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your Personal Data. Those circumstances include when (i) the Personal Data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed; (ii) you withdraw consent to consent-based Processing such as marketing; (iii) you object to Processing and a balance of your rights against Legitimate Interests weighs in your favor, and/or (iv) the Processing is unlawful. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure, including where Processing is necessary for compliance with Legitimate Interests which override the right to erasure.

(d)  _The Right to Restrict Processing._ In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the Processing of your Personal Data. Those circumstances include when you (i) accurately contest the accuracy of the Personal Data; (ii) Processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure of it; (iii) we no longer need the Personal Data for the purposes of our Processing, and (iv) you have objected to Processing but our verification of your objection is still pending. Where Processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your Personal Data but will only Process it with your consent, for our Legitimate Interests or upon governmental order or request.

(e)  _The Right to Object to Processing._ You have a right to object, in certain circumstances, to our Processing of your Personal Data. Among other grounds, you may object to our Processing of your Personal Data if we do not honor your rightful withdrawal of consent-based Processing or when you disagree with our assertion of Legitimate Interests. In such case, we will no longer Process the applicable Personal Data unless we can demonstrate compelling Legitimate Interests for such Processing which override your Data Rights. But if you do object to our Processing, we will seek to accommodate your request to the extent practicable.

(f)  _The Right to Data Portability._ To the extent that the legal basis for our Processing of your Personal Data is (i) your consent; or (ii) the Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract and such Processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your Personal Data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it is outweighed by our Legitimate Interests or when it would adversely affect the rights or interests of others.

(g)  _The Right to Complain to a Supervisory Authority._ If you believe that our Processing of your Personal Data violates GDPR, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a Supervisory Authority responsible for data protection in the EU member state of your residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged violation.

(h)  _The Right to Withdraw Consent._ To the extent that our Processing of your Personal Data is based solely upon your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time, which will terminate such Processing. A withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing based on consent before our receipt of your withdrawal of consent.

##### 10\. Legal Bases for Our Processing of Personal Information

10.1 Lawful Basis for Processing. As provide in Article 6 of GDPR, Processing is lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following justifications applies:

(a) The Data Subject has given consent to the Processing of his or her Personal Data for one or more specific purposes;

(b) Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the Data Subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the Data Subject prior to entering into a contract;

(c) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;

(d) Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;

(e) Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; and/or

(f) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the Legitimate Interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where a balancing of such Legitimate Interests is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject.

10.2 Legitimate Interests. Under Article 11 of GDPR, if the purposes for which a controller processes Personal Data do not require the identification of a Data Subject, the controller shall not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in or-der to identify the Data Subject solely to comply with GDPR. Also, Data Subject Rights as set forth in Articles 15-20 of the GDPR do not apply unless the controller actually receives additional information that enables the Data Subject to be identified. This provision is further support for our Processing of Personal Information in Threat Analysis Tools, OSINT and CAL, which may contain inadvertent, incidental or unassociated elements of Personal In-formation of Data Subjects.

10.3 Processing Based Upon Consent. Our collection and Processing of Personal Data associated solely with (i) your visitation to our Sites, without the purchase or preparation for purchase of any Products or Services, or (ii) for our own marketing purposes is your voluntary, informed consent.

##### 11\. Security of Personal Information

Taking into account the state-of-the-art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we agree to implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of Processing your Personal Information.

##### 12\. Retaining and Deleting Personal Information

12.1 Our data retention policies and procedures are designed to ensure that we comply with our legal obligations in relation to the retention and deletion of Personal In-formation, whether held by us or by any Sub-Processor or Vendor. We will take such reasonable steps as necessary to ensure that any duty or obligation that we have under this policy with regard to your Personal Information, including the return or erasure thereof, applies with equal effect to any Sub-Processor or Vendor with which we share such data.

12.2 Personal Information that we Process for any purpose will not be kept for longer than is necessary for the realization or completion of that purpose; provided that our Legitimate Interests justify a substantial retention period for the data subject to such Legitimate Interests and so long as they apply.  
12.3 We will retain your Personal Information as follows:

(a) User Data that has retained its character as Personal Information will be held and retained by us for the longer of (i) your withdrawal of any consent for such data collected on the basis of your consent; (ii) your exercise of any right to erasure or portability of any User Data subject to such Data Rights; and (iii) the minimum period necessary for us to fulfill the purposes of our ThreatConnect Processing Authorities or meet our Legitimate Interests with regard to such User Data;

(b) User Data for which its character as Personal Information has been eliminated, will be retained by us in its Anonymized, Pseudonymized or processed form as ThreatConnect Data and should never be expected to be recoverable, erasable or returnable as Personal Information; and

12.4 Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 12, we may retain your Personal Information beyond the period set forth in Section 12.3 where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person or for us to meet our other Legitimate Interests.
