<br><a href="#top">Top of page</a><p>
<a name="gather"></a><b>What information do we gather on our Web site?</b><br>
When you register for Lutherans Online chat rooms and message boards, other free Lutherans Online services, or Thrivent Financial Members Only area we ask that you provide your name, date of birth, e-mail address, and postal address (including city, state, and ZIP code).
 </p><p>
In other sections of our Web site (e.g., the information request form, free offers order forms), we may capture additional information such as telephone number, name of your church, the home city/state of your church, and whether or not you are Lutheran. 
 </p><p>
For added security, to access any of your personal contract/account information online in the Account Access section, you will need to provide your Social Security number and a personal identification number (PIN). These numbers are used to identify you as a unique user who is authorized for access.

<br><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><p>

<a name="info"></a><b>What other information do we capture?</b><br>
Thrivent Financial's Web server automatically recognizes only your IP address when you visit our site as an anonymous visitor (without logging in). It does not recognize your e-mail address. However, we do collect your e-mail address if you communicate with us via e-mail, register at our site or provide your e-mail address to us when completing an online survey. 
</p><p>
Thrivent Financial collects aggregate information about the pages visited within our Web site. We do not track an individual's path through our site.
</p><p>
If you access or service your accounts online using your password or PIN to authenticate yourself, a record of your online activity is maintained.

<br><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><p>

<a name="change"></a><b>How can you update the personal information you provide online?</b><br>
You can change any online registration information you have entered about yourself or a family member through your Internet User Profile. To update your profile:
</p><ol>
<li>Click on <b>Manage my Profile</b> in the left navigation bar of Members Only or Lutherans Online.
</li><li>Click the link for the information category you would like to update.
</li><li>Update and verify your personal information as desired. Note: Your Internet user name cannot be changed.
</li><li>Save your changes. The information in your Internet User Profile will be updated.
</li></ol>

<br><a href="#top">Top of page</a><p>

<a name="do"></a><b>What do we do with the information we gather?</b><br>
We use the information we gather about our site visitors in one or more of the following ways:
</p><ul>
<li>To verify your Thrivent Financial membership status and/or account ownership.
</li><li>To fulfill orders and requests for additional information.
</li><li>To fulfill your requests for contact from a Thrivent Financial Associate.
</li><li>To help ensure a safer online environment for our site visitors.
</li><li>For general aggregate site visitor analysis and statistical research.
</li><li>To inform customer service professionals or financial associates about account access and service requests that 	will enable us to provide you with better customer service.
</li><li>To inform you of updates to our Web site.
</li><li>For marketing purposes to provide you with information about products and services available through Thrivent 	Financial and/or its affiliated companies that may be of interest to you. 
</li></ul>
<br><a href="#top">Top of page</a><p>

<a name="cookie"></a><b>Do we use cookie technology?</b><br>
Yes, Thrivent Financial's Web site uses cookie technology. Cookies are messages given to your Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message on your computer in a text file called cookie.txt. The message is then sent back to the server each time your browser requests that site. When you register for Thrivent Financial Members Only area or Lutherans Online, you can request cookies store your user name and password. By using the cookie, your computer will remember who you are when you try to re-visit that section of the Web site, so you will not need to type your user name and password every time you enter. 
</p><p>
Note: If you use more than one computer, you will have to supply your user name and password when you use a computer other than the one you registered with because the Web server won't be able to identify that computer. 
</p><p>
Cookie technology also may be used in various sections of our Web site to provide you with personalized services and increase the quality of your online experiences. 
</p><p>
Cookies cannot be used to reveal your e-mail address obtained from your hard drive or learn confidential or personal information about you that you have not already explicitly revealed. 

<br><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><p>

<a name="encryption"></a><b>Do we use encryption technology?</b><br>
Several areas on Thrivent Financial's Web site (e.g., Account Access) have been built to handle sensitive or confidential information. These pages utilize an Internet method known as Secure Socket Layers (SSL). With SSL engaged, pages are sent to you in an encrypted (scrambled) format and any information you submit to Thrivent Financial also is encrypted. Encryption is the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone who doesn't have the appropriate decryption key. This method of transferring sensitive data is considered the industry standard for the Internet. 
</p><p>
For added security, close your browser completely when you finish using this site.  While online, your browser is using part of your computer's memory. If your broswer is left open, it may be possible for someone using your computer to go back and use this memory to access your information.  By closing your browser, the memory it is using is cleared.  You may also want to consider clearing your browser's temporary files.
</p><p>
For your security, we highly recommend you update your browser to versions that support SSL. Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer are two browsers that support these encryption techniques. Netscape will display a solid key graphic in the lower left corner when the SSL mode is engaged and the connection is encrypted. Internet Explorer displays a lock on the icon bar in the lower right corner while encrypted. If you are not sure if your browser is compatible, check with your service provider. 
</p><p>
Thrivent Financial has taken steps to make all information you provide to us as secure as possible against unauthorized access and use, alteration, and/or loss. This information is kept in Thrivent Financial's secure database. You should keep in mind, however, that no data transmission over the Internet is 100 percent secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be intercepted and used by unauthorized parties. 

<br><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><p>
<a name="13"></a><b>What is our policy for children (individuals under 13 years of age)?</b><br>
Your children's safety is important to us! We have developed our privacy guidelines in compliance with the requirements outlined by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). No information should be submitted to or posted on our site by children under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 
</p><p>
Registration will not be accepted if the birth date indicates the individual is under the age of 13. We recommend parents/guardians of the children register first and then add the children as family members. Be sure the box indicating the member (child) is a minor is checked. 
</p><p>
As part of the Members Only registration process, registrants can elect to have their names added to the Member Directory. If you select this option when adding your children, their names, states of residence, and e-mail addresses are available to other members so they can communicate with each other via e-mail. To select/unselect this option in your children's profiles, go to the Members Only area and change their user profile information. 
</p><p>
We encourage you to participate in your children's online experiences and ask that all children have their parent's or guardian's permission before sharing any personal information on our Web site (or anyone online for that matter). 

<br><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><p>
<a name="links"></a><b>What about links to other Web sites from Thrivent Financial's site?</b><br>
The Thrivent Financial Web site contains links to several other Internet sites. Although our intent is to provide links to other quality sites, we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of information you provide to these linked sites. Any data or personal information collected by Web sites other than Thrivent Financial for Lutherans are not covered by this privacy policy. 
<br><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><p>
