**RhythmOne Privacy Policy**

**LAST UPDATED May 23, 2018**

Unless otherwise indicated below, this privacy policy applies to any RhythmOne website, any RhythmOne service as well as any personal information RhythmOne may collect across partnered and unaffiliated sites.

RhythmOne (“RhythmOne” or “we” or “us”), is committed to protecting your (“your” or “you” or “user”) privacy. This privacy policy describes how RhythmOne collects and uses the personal information you provide as well as your rights in relation to such information.

**Data Collection of User Information**

RhythmOne collects information that does not directly identify you but that may include but not be limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, sites you have visited, products you have researched and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of RhythmOne’s clients.

In addition, RhythmOne may engage third party providers such as Google Analytics to process the information described above but solely for purposes of monitoring user behavior on the site or service.

**Consumer Information**

RhythmOne is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. RhythmOne does not collect or use "sensitive consumer information" (as defined in the NAI's Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct) in its online behavioral advertising activities and does not offer or sell to its clients segments based on sensitive consumer information. "Sensitive consumer information" includes social security numbers or other government-issued identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, information that describes the precise real-time geographic location of an individual derived through location-based services such as through GPS-enabled devices, and precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic and family medical history. RhythmOne maintains internal policies and procedures designed to safeguard against the collection or use of such information.

**Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA Users only)**

If you are a User from the European Economic Area, our or our customer's legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our platform and communicating with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting us” heading below.

**Opting Out of Cookies**

Opting Out of Cookies RhythmOne is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), a cooperative of companies committed to building responsible advertising policies across the Internet, and adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. RhythmOne is also a member of the Network Advertising Imitative (NAI) and we adhere to NAI’s 2013 Code of Conduct. To learn more about interest-based or online behavioral advertising, and other advertising companies’ privacy policies and opt-out, please visit the DAA Website - <http://www.aboutads.info/>. You can opt-out of receiving RhythmOne cookies. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the website may not work properly. If you opt out, your web browser will be associated with a generic "opt-out" cookie, which will prevent us from associating any non-personally identifiable information with your browser. Our "opt-out" cookie has a five-year expiration date. Keep in mind that participating in our opt-out program does not prevent you from seeing ads served by us, instead, the ads we serve to you will be generic and not be targeted to you based on your web surfing experiences. If you would like to opt out, please visit our Opt-Out page - <http://www.rhythmone.com/opt-out>. Alternatively, you may also choose not to use our website, you may also Opt-Out through the NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out Page - <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>. These Opt-Outs are cookie-based, so you may need to opt out again (and set a new "opt-out" cookie) if you delete your cookies, lock cookies (including third party cookies), switch internet browsers, change computers or upgrade your web browser.

**Sensitive Health Information**

RhythmOne may use general health related information with customized advertising campaigns. General health-related information that is not based on a precise medical treatment or conditions is not considered "sensitive consumer information." This information can include, but is not limited to the following examples: acne, allergies, dental, vision, heartburn, cold and flu, sinus, headache, back pain, first aid, sore throat and cholesterol management. In addition, interest in subjects such as diet, nutrition, exercise, beauty, hair removal, health and fitness, as well as vitamins and supplements are not considered “sensitive consumer information”.

**P3P**

The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) provides a way for ad networks and websites to publish their privacy policies in a machine-readable syntax. An ad network or website will deploy P3P in order to make its privacy practices more accessible to the site's visitors. A visitor's web browser can download the machine-readable privacy statements, and compare the contents of those statements to the user's preferences. This way, the user's browser can automatically notify the user when they visit a site whose practices match the user's preferences or warn the user if the practices and preferences don't match. RhythmOne has incorporated this technology in its ad servers. Our syntax reflects our current privacy policy.

**Cookies**

RhythmOne uses cookies to improve your web browsing experience. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer for the purpose of identifying your web browser. We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on tour computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the website. When you are served a RhythmOne ad, RhythmOne assigns various information in a cookie on ads you've seen, information on sites you've visited and activities performed to your computer browser. We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this information lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience.

RhythmOne collects this information via our technology and it may be stored for up to 2 years for the purpose of analyzing campaign results, ensuring that our technology is functioning properly, and preventing fraud across our sites. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our website or our member sites. You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website / service though your access to some functionality and areas of our website / service may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.

**Disclosure**

RhythmOne uses the information we collect to improve, support and provide our advertising, measurement and reporting services. To do so more effectively, we have associated browsers and devices accessing our services to provide better and more consistent experiences to users. Examples include:

  * Serving and selecting ads – We use the information we have to find and match appropriate audiences to advertiser campaigns and to customize the ad served to your browser or device. We may also decide to show an ad based on things you may be interested in, or request from our advertising and agency customers who decide to show ads to a particular audience, sometimes using the information we have. We also use the information to optimize ad delivery, such as the frequency and order in which ads are displayed.
  * Measurement – We use the information we have to measure and understand the effectiveness of ads served across browsers and devices. This includes measuring interactions with advertisements and advertisers’ websites, apps and stores by analyzing information such as clicks or other interactions with ads, visits to websites or apps linked to from ads.
  * Improvement of Services – We use the information we have to support our services through activities such as infrastructure monitoring and internal maintenance, analyzing how our services are used, research and development, and billing. We may also use the information we have to maintain, protect, improve and develop our and our related companies’ services.
  * Protection of you, ourselves, and others – We may use information to detect, prevent, investigate and address fraud and other unauthorized or illegal activity.
  * Support and Inquiry – We may use the information provided to respond to inquiries and to provide customer and user support.



**RhythmOne’s Use of Cross-Application and Cross-Device Technology**

We and/or our customers may collect information about your activity across multiple unaffiliated third-party mobile applications. We may share this information with our customers in order to help them predict the types of ads that may be relevant to you and to display advertising to you accordingly. This information may also be combined with a mobile advertising identifier. To opt out of such practices, please see the Third-Party Measurement Services below and the Opting Out of Cookies section above.

We and/or our customers may use technology that establishes connections among related devices (such as mobile devices and desktop computers) both in order to deliver advertising that may be more relevant to you, as well as for analytics and reporting purposes. This means that information about your use of websites or applications on one of your devices may be combined with information from your other devices.

We may also partner with third parties to provide such cross-device technology to our customers, and in doing so we may share anonymous identifiers with those third parties in order to make connections among related devices. We may also use your device’s IP address to infer connections among related devices within the same household. To opt out of RhythmOne’s use of such technologies for each web browser and on each of your devices, please follow the instructions for opting out in both web browsers and mobile applications, as described in the Third-Party Measurement Services below and Opting Out of Cookies section above.

**Third-Party Measurement Services**

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

Visitors to the RythymOne website may be subject to data collection by third-parties for the purposes of serving interest-based advertising, based on browsing behavior. To Opt-Out on interest-based advertising, please visit the DAA Website - <http://www.aboutads.info/>.

Although certain RhythmOne technology honors “do not track” (DNT) signals and similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers or mobile device operating systems, RhythmOne is not responsible, and shall not be liable, for the acts of third parties, such as ad networks, with respect to such third parties’ tracking policies.

**Credit Cards**

When credit card data is required for services, we protect your credit card information using industry standard SSL encryption whenever card data is transmitted to us and when sending your credit card information to our credit card processor. While in our possession, your credit card number is protected with asymmetric encryption to keep it secure.

**Security**

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

**Merger or Acquisition**

If RhythmOne is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or we will post a notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

**Retention**

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**About Our Advertising Services**

RadiumOne provides online display, mobile, video, and social advertising services. In order to provide our services, we buy advertising space from hundreds of websites and mobile applications around the world and resell it in targeted packages to advertisers and agencies (“ **Targeted Advertising** ”). Targeted Advertising is displayed (a) on the browsers of devices such as computers, laptops, tablets or smartphones or (b) inside mobile applications. Users benefit from Targeted Advertising by receiving advertisements (“ **ads** ”) which are more interesting and relevant than untargeted ads, while advertisers benefit through the more efficient delivery of ads to interested Users.

Targeted Advertising is based on data that does not directly identify you and is collected from your devices as described below in “What Information We Collect”. Data used in Targeted Advertising may range from your (i) interests, (ii) similarities to other Users, (iii) general demographic information, and (iv) general geographic location. This non directly identifiable information is also known as pseudonymous data and may be used to classify Users who are most likely to respond to an ad. We do not intentionally collect information that identifies you (such as your name, address, phone number, or email address), and we prohibit our partners from sharing this information with us.

**What Information We Collect**

The information we collect falls into two categories – **Browser-Based Data** and **Mobile App-Based Data**.
