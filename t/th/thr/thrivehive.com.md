# Privacy Policy | ThriveHive

ThriveHive is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to both our websites (Websites), including www.ThriveHive.com, and our Marketing Platform website application (Platform), including our associated mobile website applications (Mobile Platform). This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices. By using the Websites or the Platform, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Websites or the Platform.

We periodically update this Privacy Policy and we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.  
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**1\. Important Information**  
**1.1. Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a new version online. You should check this page occasionally to review any changes. If we make any material changes we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Websites. This helps you to always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. Your continued use of the Websites, the Platform, and/or continued provision of Personal Information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.

**1.2. Contact Us**  
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our treatment of the information you provide us, please write to us by email at support@thrivehive.com or by mail to ThriveHive 222 Third Street, Suite 0234, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA, Attn: Privacy.

**2\. Use of the Platform by ThriveHive and our Customers**  
**2.1. The ThriveHive Platform**  
Our online Platform allows any company that uses it (our customers and ThriveHive itself) to build marketing webpages on our servers where visitors can learn more about the company, download content, and provide their contact information and other demographic information. This information, which is stored and managed on our service providers’ servers, is then used so that the visitors can be contacted about their interest in the company’s goods or services and interact with the company. ThriveHive provides the Platform to our customers for their own marketing and lead generation, and we use it on our Websites for our own marketing and lead generation.

**2.2. Use by ThriveHive**  
We use our own Platform to build webpages that people can visit to learn more about ThriveHive. Information that we collect and manage using the Platform for our own marketing belongs to us and is used, disclosed and protected according to this Privacy Policy.

**2.3. Use by Our Customers**  
Our customers use the Platform to build webpages that people can visit to learn more about their business. ThriveHive does not control the content of these webpages or the types of information that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the Platform. That information belongs to them and is used, disclosed and protected by them according to their privacy policies and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. ThriveHive processes our customers’ information as they direct and in accordance with our agreements with our customers, and we store it on our service providers’ servers, but we do not have control over its collection or management. Our agreements with our customers prohibit us from using that information, except as necessary to provide and improve the Platform, as permitted by this Privacy Policy, and as required by law. We have no direct relationship with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers. Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating information they have collected from you using the Platform. We may work with our customers to help them provide notice to their visitors about their data collection, processing and usage. Our agreements with our customers prohibit them from using the Platform to collect, manage, or process Sensitive Information. We are not responsible for our customers’ use of information they collect on the Platform.

**2.4. “Sensitive Information”**  
This refers to credit or debit card numbers, personal financial account information, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, driver’s license numbers or similar personal identifiers, racial or ethnic origin, physical or mental health condition or information, or other employment, financial or health information.

**2.5. Lawful Purpose**  
Services provided to or used by the User may only be for lawful purposes. Transmission, storage, copying, or modifying any material or other actions by the User in violation of any Federal, State or Local regulation is prohibited. This includes material legally judged to be threatening or obscene, pornographic, profane, or material protected by trade secrets. This also includes, but is not limited to, material protected by copyright, trade secret, or any other statute, threatening material, or obscene material. Users are prohibited from using ThriveHive for the propagation, distribution, housing, processing, storing, or otherwise handling in any way lewd, obscene, or pornographic material, or any other material which ThriveHive deems, in its sole discretion, to be objectionable, including, but not limited to, pornography, satanic materials, and any and all materials of an adult nature. This also includes links or any connection to such materials. The designation of any materials as such described above is left entirely to the discretion of the ThriveHive management. The User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless and defend ThriveHive from any claims resulting from the User’s use or User’s allowed use by others of the Services which damages either ThriveHive, its officers, its employees, its directors, its partners, or another party or parties.

In those cases, we do not transfer your unique Personal Information to the third party.

**4.7. Service Providers**  
We employ other companies and people to provide services to visitors to our Websites, our customers, and users of the Platform and may need to share your information with them to provide information, products or services to you. Examples may include removing repetitive information from prospect lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, supplementing the information you provide us in order to provide you with better service, and providing customer service.

**4.9. Social Media Features**  
Our Websites include Social Media and Email Features, such as the Facebook Like button Widgets, such as the Share This button or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these features. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy and other policies of the companies providing them.

**4.10. External Websites**  
Our Websites provide links to other websites. We do not control, and are not responsible for, the content or practices of these other websites. Our provision of such links does not constitute our endorsement of these other websites, their content, their owners, or their practices. This Privacy Policy does not apply to these other websites, which are subject to any privacy and other policies they may have. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any web site you visit.

**4.11. Blogs**  
We offer publicly accessible blogs. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose any information through our public blogs this information may be collected and used by others. We will correct or delete any information you have posted on the Websites if you so request, as described in “Opting Out and Unsubscribing” below.

**4.12. Retention of Personal Information**  
We retain Personal Information that you provide us as long as we consider it potentially useful in contacting you about the Platform or our other services, and then we securely delete the information. We will delete this information from the servers at an earlier date if you so request, as described in “Opting Out and Unsubscribing” below. If you provide information to our customers as part of their use of the Platform, our customers decide how long to retain the personal information they collect from you.

**5\. Navigational Information**  
**5.1. Cookies**  
We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Websites, or register for the Platform, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the ThriveHive Platform or Websites you visit. ThriveHive keeps track of the Websites and pages you visit within ThriveHive, in order to determine what portion of the ThriveHive Website or Platform is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the ThriveHive Website and Platform to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.

**5.2. Log Files**  
We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files that are not associated with your name or other personally identifying information. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by ThriveHive for the operation of the Platform, to maintain quality of the Platform, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the ThriveHive Website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.

**5.3. Tracking Pixels**  
We employ a software technology called tracking pixels, that help us better manage the Website and Platform by informing us what content is effective. Tracking pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use tracking pixels in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by tracking pixels in emails to our customers’ Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Opting Out and Unsubscribing”.

**5.4. URL**  
One feature of the Services is the ability to create shortened uniform resource locators (URLs) of websites. ThriveHive collects and stores both the original URL and the shortened URL and, if you are logged in to your Account, we will associate that information with your Account. ThriveHive also collects and stores the time and date on which you shortened the original URL and when you share the ThriveHive Link, and information on the channels through which the ThiveHive Link was shared.

**5.5. Metrics and Analytics**  
ThriveHive collects information about accesses (such as clicks) of every ThriveHive Link created through the Services. This information includes, but is not limited to: (i) the IP address and physical location of the devices accessing the ThriveHive Link; (ii) the referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of each access; and (iv) information about sharing of the ThriveHive Link on Third Party Services such as Twitter and Facebook. These metrics and analytics are used by ThriveHive and its partners to improve their websites and services by, for example, providing value-added features.

**5.6. Navigational Information Collected by Our Customers**  
Our customers can use the tools we provide, as well as tools provided by third parties, to collect Navigational Information when you visit their webpages on the Platform. ThriveHive does not control our customers’ use of these tools, nor do we control the information they collect or how they use it.

**5.7. Third Party Tracking Technologies**  
The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies

**5.8. Advertising**  
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.

**6\. Opting Out and Unsubscribing**
