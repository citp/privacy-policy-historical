# Privacy Policy

On this page, you'll find all the information about what data we collect about our visitors and customers and how that data is used. We've described everything as clearly and concisely as possible and avoid legalese as much as possible, so that you can make sense of all this without needing a law degree.

We regularly review and, where necessary, update our privacy information. If we plan to use personal data for a new purpose, we update our privacy information and communicate the changes to individuals before starting any new processing.  

## What We Do

At Thrive Themes, we build WordPress themes and plugins so that individuals and businesses can build conversion-focused web sites on the WordPress platform.

We do not own or host your site.  Instead we offer distributed software that you can install on a WordPress installation that you own.

## What Data We Collect

Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site, your IP address.

## What Are Cookies?

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

Here you can find out more about ["What cookies we use in our products"](https://thrivethemes.com/tkb_item/what-cookies-do-the-thrive-products-use-and-why/) .

## Cookie Use for Retargeting

We may use Google Analytics and the DoubleClick advertising network as well as other advertising networks to display ads across the Internet, based on your visit to our website.

Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet. Our site and third-party vendors, use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on past visits and pages visited on this website.

You can opt-out of this kind of advertising anytime, [here](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) and [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

## IP Addresses

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.

## Data we Collect in More Detail

#### 1\. As a Visitor

You're a "visitor" if you browse the thrivethemes.com website but don't submit any personal information about yourself. 

For example, if you visit this website and take a look through our blog content, our sales pages and knowledge base without signing up for anything, then you're a visitor. 

As a visitor, the website uses several third party services that act in order to provide you with a better experience and allow us to optimize our content.  

The following third parties have limited access to some of your data:-

  * Facebook
    * We use Facebook conversion tracking to understand how our Facebook ads are performing.
