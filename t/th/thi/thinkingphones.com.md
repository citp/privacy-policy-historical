**Security**

Thinking Phone Networks Websites take precautions to protect our users' information.

Transactions, access to transactional records, or access to account information occurs over a server that has safeguards such as secure server software (SSL) which encrypts information before transmission. You can confirm that pages are encrypted, and we urge you to do so before submitting or transmitting sensitive information, by viewing the lock icon on the bottom of most browsers.

You may edit your account information and account profile at any time using your email address and password. Do not divulge your password to anyone. Thinking Phone Networks will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or in an unsolicited e-mail.
