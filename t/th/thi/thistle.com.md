**Profiling and preferences**

We sometimes make decisions about what your interests are based on the way that you interact with us and the information we hold about you, this is called profiling. For example, if you regularly stay at a particular hotel or frequently choose a specific room or pillow type, then we might use this information improve your experience by pre-selecting certain features of your stay for you, so you don’t need to. Understanding your preferences and personalising your experience in this way allows us to deliver the very best service possible.

This may also include any websites and apps of our partners who are in our advertising networks.

We may send you direct marketing while you have an ongoing relationship with us and for a reasonable time after you have used one of or products or services.

We may use your information to send you newsletters, bulletins, and other “in-life” communications (about your stay), and triggered communications where you make changes to your account or other information about products and services you have signed up for.

Service communications will be sent to you regarding products and services you interact with. These are important messages relating to the products and services we provide to you.

**Data matching and audience insights**

Sometimes we may compare our customer database with our commercial customers or partners databases either directly with each other or by using an independent third party. This helps us understand if customers are on both databases, and allows us to plan joint marketing activities, and promotions. Additionally we may match databases for business planning/continuity purposes.

We may use marketing permissions we hold to contact those customers for promotions that relate to data matching exercises.

We will only share personal information for data matching purposes where we have an agreement in place with the commercial customer or partner. This ensures that they comply with their data protection obligations, protect the information we share and limit the use of any shared information.

We may provide commercial customers and partners with information about the effectiveness of campaigns they run and well as the potential reach of future campaigns by providing aggregated reports of customer segments. This is called audience insights and helps us plan promotions and other marketing campaigns. your personal information is not shared for this activity.
