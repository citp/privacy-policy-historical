Each time a user visits our website, certain use and navigation information is collected by our servers. This information is aggregated and anonymous. It gives us information such as the number, frequency and duration of visits to each web page, which information we use to improve the content and navigation features of our website.

We also use “cookies” on our site. Cookies are small pieces of information that our server places on a visitor’s hard drive to enable that person to use our site more easily. For example, we place a cookie on your computer when you visit our site. The next time you visit our site using the same computer, our server will recognize the cookie and your personal preferences.

If you would like to opt out of accepting cookies altogether, you can generally set your browser to not accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. However, certain features of our website or other services may not work optimally if you delete or disable cookies.

We collect personal information about you when you provide it to us, such as through your use of our website and its features, when you contact us directly by e-mail, phone, in writing, or via social media, when you order goods and services, when you use any of our other applications, and any other means by which you provide personal information to us. The type of information we collect about you may include the following kinds of information:

  * Your name
  * Your e-mail address
  * Your postal address
  * Your phone number
  * Your payment information (e.g., your credit or debit card details)

  * Information about how you use our website (e.g., which pages you have viewed, the time you viewed them and what you clicked on)
  * Information about your mobile device (such as your geographical location)



Information we obtain from third parties will generally include your name and contact details, but may include any additional information they provide to us, including some or all of the types of information set out in the list above.

We may also obtain personal information about you from certain publicly accessible sources, including (but not limited to) the electoral register, online customer databases, third-party lists and directories, media publications, social media, websites and other publicly accessible sources.

When you place an order, submit your account information, or participate in ThirdLove promotions or surveys, our website collects your personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, and mailing address. ThirdLove will use your information to process and fulfill your order. Additionally, your e-mail address may be collected at various points within the website (including when you place an order with us) so that we can send you any necessary e-mail messages related to your order, such as order and shipping confirmations.

**Use of Your Personal Information**

At ThirdLove, we understand and recognize that we must maintain and use customer information responsibly.

We maintain a record of your purchase history, product interests, and whatever other details might enable us to improve your shopping experience. Analytics such as website use and traffic patterns are also considered to help us improve the design of our website, the products we make and exclusive services we offer.

ThirdLove does not rent or sell to others your e-mail address. We do not store or share credit card information with third parties, except for the purpose of processing your order payment and as required by law.

If for any reason you choose to access a third-party website linked to our website, you do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for how these outside parties may collect, use, protect or disclose the information you provide them.

ThirdLove never stores or saves pictures taken by our sizing app. All measurement calculations take place natively on your phone.

In order to better understand our customers’ body types and preferences for particular styles, we may collect and analyze aggregated, anonymous measurement, size and shape information about our users and their purchases. The anonymous, aggregated data that we may collect could be used in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, improving the performance of our products and helping us to understand more about the relationships between body shapes, sizes and style preferences. We may also, in the future, share such aggregated, anonymous information with third-party partners. By providing your personal information to us, you are consenting to the collection and use of such anonymous, aggregated data.

These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. We may also combine the personal information you provide with other personal information available from other sources. This information will then be used to enhance and personalize your shopping experience, and to make our marketing efforts more efficient.
