## Usage Reports

In order to better understand traffic patterns on any site owned and operated by ThinkSales.co.za, we analyse our site activity to obtain overall usage statistics. These usage statistics provide us with certain information obtained from data within the browser string (information contained in every user’s browser). Information we collect from the browser string includes domain name, browser type, operating system and MIME type.

## E-mail Data Analysis

From time to time, we provide our e-mail lists (newsletters and special offers) to third party companies who provide specialised services, such as e-mail message deployment, merge-purge (identifying and removing duplicate addresses) of lists, statistical analysis and other data processing.

## Cookies

All sites owned and operated by ThinkSales use cookies. A cookie is a small data file written to your hard drive. Cookies allow us to understand user behaviour so that we can more effectively develop information and programmes to serve you better. Advertisers require information regarding ad impressions and click-through rates, and by providing them with this information, we are able to keep our sites FREE to our visitors.

If you are concerned about the use of cookies, you have the option to set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, or to turn off cookies entirely. The options to warn or disable cookies can be found in the “Options” or “Preferences” feature of your browser.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO ENABLE COOKIES IN ORDER TO USE ANY SITE OWNED AND OPERATED BY THINKSALES.

## Beacons

Like many websites, ThinkSales may also use pixel tags, also known as beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behaviour and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement. We may also implement pixel tags provided by other companies for the same purpose.

## Links to Other Sites

Please be aware that when you are on ThinkSales.co.za or any site owned by ThinkSales, or when you receive an e-mail message from us on behalf of a marketer according to permission granted through our opt-in process for newsletters and special offers, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control, such as the marketer’s site. There may be links to other sites from ThinkSales.co.za pages or from the e-mail message we send to you that take you outside ThinkSales.co.za.

As a result, while ThinkSales.co.za strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible and/or liable for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information by direct or indirect use of our website.
