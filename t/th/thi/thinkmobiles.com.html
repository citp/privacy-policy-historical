            <p>CLIENT’S RIGHTS IN RESPECT TO ITS PERSONAL DATA</p>
            <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2017/676, you have various rights in relation to your
                personal data. All of these rights can be exercised by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@thinkmobiles.com">info@thinkmobiles.com</a>. In certain circumstances, you
                have the following rights in relation to your personal data: </p>
            <ul class="number-list">
                <li>Right of access — you have the right to obtain from us information as to whether your personal data
                    is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to such personal data. You may access and
                    amend your personal data, request the details about purposes of processing of your personal data and
                    prevent from undesirable marketing by opting-out. If you wish to opt out of marketing, use
                    ‘unsubscribe’ option available at our e-mails.
                </li>
                <li>Right to withdraw consent — when we rely on your consent for processing of your personal data, you
                    have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. However, the withdrawal of your consent will
                    not affect the lawfulness of Thinkmobiles’s processing based on consent before your withdrawal.
                </li>
                <li>Right to rectification — we will use reasonable endeavors to ensure that your personal information
                    is accurate. In order to assist us with this, you should notify us of any changes to the personal
                    information that you have provided to us by sending us a request to rectify your personal data where
                    you believe the personal data we have is inaccurate or incomplete.
                </li>
                <li>Right to restriction of processing — you have the right to ask us to stop processing your personal
                    data at any time.
                </li>
                <li>Right to erasure — Asking us to delete all of your personal data will result in Thinkmobiles
                    deleting your personal data without undue delay (unless there is a legitimate and legal reason why
                    we are unable to delete certain of your personal data, in which case we will inform you of this).
                    Asking us to stop processing your personal data or deleting your personal data will likely mean that
                    you are no longer able to use our Services.
                </li>
                <li>Right to data portability — You have the right to request that Thinkmobiles provides you with a copy
                    of all of your personal data and to transmit your personal data to another data controller in a
                    structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, where it is technically feasible for us to do
                    so and the processing is based on consent or contractual performance.
                </li>
                <li>Right to complain — although we encourage our customers to engage with us in the event they have any
                    concerns or complaints, you have the right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority.
                </li>
                <li>Right to object automated processing — you have the right not to be subject to a decision based
                    solely on automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which produces legal or
                    similarly significant effects on you. There may be exceptions or limitations to this right as
                    defined under relevant data protection laws. We will not ordinarily charge you in respect of any
                    requests we receive to exercise any of your rights detailed above, however, if you make excessive,
                    repetitive or manifestly unfounded requests, we may charge you an administration fee in order to
                    process such requests or refuse to act on such requests. When you request us to rectify or erase
                    your personal data or restrict any processing of such data, we may notify third parties to whom such
                    personal data has been disclosed of such request. However, such third party may have the right to
                    retain and continue to process such personal data in its own right, for example to enable it to
                    comply with its own legal obligations.
                </li>
                <li>Right to make a request - you may also send a request to receive the information which is been
                    processed, amended, deleted or locked and information about any parties to which we transmit your
                    personal data.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In some case we may charge a fee (based on our reasonable costs) if the requests are excessive
                considering the nature of the request itself or nature and functionality of our services.</p>

            <p>SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THINKMOBILES AFFILIATES AND NON-AFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES </p>
            <p>Thinkmobiles does not sell, license, lease or otherwise disclose your personal information to any
                affiliate or third party for any reason, except as described below. Thinkmobiles may share information
                with affiliates if the information is required to provide the product or service you have requested or
                to provide you the opportunity to participate in the products or services our affiliates offer. </p>
            <p>To help us improve our services to you, we may engage another business to help us carry out certain
                internal functions, such as account processing, fulfillment, client service, client satisfaction surveys
                or other data collection activities relevant to our business. We may also provide a non-affiliated third
                party with client information from our database, including your name, address, phone number, and/or
                e-mail address, to help us analyze and identify client needs, notify clients of product and service
                offerings or conduct general marketing and market research for us. </p>
            <p>Thinkmobiles also forges partnerships and alliances with non-affiliated third parties which offer
                high-quality products and services that might be of value to our clients. In order to ensure that these
                products and services meet your needs and are delivered in a manner that is useful and relevant,
                Thinkmobiles may share some personal information with these non-affiliated third parties. </p>
            <p>We always require that all non-affiliated third parties to which we provide your nonpublic personal
                information agree to keep your information confidential and use such information solely for the limited
                purpose for which we have engaged them, or as otherwise required by law. In addition, where offers are
                made to you by non-affiliated third parties, we always require that they disclose that the offer is
                being extended because of your relationship with us. We also seek to ensure that these nonaffiliated
                third parties maintain appropriate data security procedures to guard against unauthorized use of, or
                access to, your personal information. </p>

                parties or regulatory, law enforcement or other government authorities. We may also disclose your
                information to credit reporting or collection agencies, or when necessary to protect our rights or
                property. If at any time you choose to purchase a product or service offered by another company, for
                example by clicking on an advertisement on a website owned or controlled by Thinkmobiles, any personal
                information you share with that company will no longer be controlled under our Privacy Statement. We are

                other information. Please note that the information you are providing is going to a third party and you
                should familiarize yourself with the privacy policy published by that third party. </p>
