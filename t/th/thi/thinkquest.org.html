Personal information is also collected about participants in our programs, for the purposes
of administering those programs and communicating with the participants.

 We will not make personal information available to outside  organizations, except for organizations  that work with us on the ThinkQuest programs.  In that case, such personal information is
used only for purposes related to the ThinkQuest programs.
