This Privay Policy is effective on February 15, 2017.

Welcome to Thisissand by Beige Elephant Ltd. ("Thisissand," "we," "us" or "our"). Thisissand provides a beautiful, relaxing and fun way to create sand artwork and share it through our content-sharing platform.

  * Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Thisissand services (collectively, the "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.
  * By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to create content, including sand artwork, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at <https://thisissand.com/legal/terms>).
  * Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").



## 1\. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information.

Information you provide us directly:

  * Your username when you register for a Thisissand account.
  * Your password and e-mail address if you register a Thisissand account using an e-mail address.
  * Possible profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., profile picture).
  * User Content (e.g., sand artwork, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
  * Communications between you and Thisissand. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.



Analytics information:

  * We use third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.



Cookies and similar technologies:

  * When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Thisissand and provide features to you.



Log file information:

  * Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
  * When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
  * In case the Service should malfunction, the web page or app may send diagnostic information about the user session to our or third party servers to be analyzed.



Device identifiers:

  * When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Thisissand
  * A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content. A device identifier together with log files may also be helpful when tracking down errors in the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.



Metadata:

  * Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
  * Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post a photo), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive.

In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:

## 6\. Children’s Privacy

The Service and its content are intended to be suitable for all ages. However, registering a user account requires that you are at least 13 years old.

In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 (or a child under 13 years of age has registered a user account), we will delete that information and/or terminate the user account as quickly as possible.

We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Service, including the information or content contained within them. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Service to another website or service, our Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link on our website, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. In addition, you agree that we are not responsible and do not have control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service and you allow them to access your User Content you do so at your own risk.
