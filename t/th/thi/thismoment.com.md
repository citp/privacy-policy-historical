**Overview**

The application that you are viewing is called the thismoment Distributed Engagement Channel (“DEC” or the “Service”). The DEC is operated by us, thismoment, Inc., for our partner whose content and brand are featured in the DEC. The DEC is a multi-media application that enables our partner to tell you about its products, services or special events while also allowing you, the user, to participate in the experience by submitting your own content, such as comments, photos and videos. The DEC may include content from multiple social networks and sites, such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Flickr. The DEC may appear on the website of one or more of those services, on our partner’s site or on other sites.

Because we are offering the Service on behalf of our partner, all information that we collect is made available to our partner whose DEC you are viewing under the terms of this Privacy Policy (e.g., if you are interacting with a DEC for Chevy, the information we collect is made available to Chevy). This information may also be made available under the terms of this Privacy Policy to the operator of the website where you interacted with the DEC under the terms of this Privacy Policy (e.g., if you interacted with the DEC on YouTube, the information we collect may be made available to YouTube). 

In some cases, the DEC may also include a link to our partner’s privacy policy, in which case the information that we collect may also be used under the terms of that policy (e.g., if you are interacting with a DEC for Chevy and a link to Chevy’s privacy policy is also displayed on the DEC, then the information collected through the DEC is also subject to Chevy’s privacy policy). 

This Service is not intended for use by persons under thirteen (13) years of age. Thismoment does not knowingly collect Personal Information from or about children under the age of thirteen (13).

For the privacy policy applicable to my.thismoment.com, see [my.thismoment.com/privacy](http://my.thismoment.com/privacy).

**Information based on standard web protocols**

Some of our DECs include third-party applications, which have their own privacy policies that govern their collection of information. Any information received by thismoment form those third-party applications will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Analytics technologies**

We use third party service providers to help us collect, report and analyze information about how users interact with our Service. These providers include Google Analytics ([see privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html)) and Omniture ([see privacy policy](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product)). 

**Information Collected by Third Parties**

This Privacy Policy only applies to thismoment’s Services. It does not apply to, and we do not have control over, the sites on which our Services are distributed or products, services or sites that are linked to from within our Service. These sites may place cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. We may also display advertisements on our sites, and in the course of serving the ads, some advertisers and their ad serving partners may place cookies on your computer or may recognize and collect data based on a cookie previously placed on your computer. We do not have access to or control over the data or cookies of these third parties. 

**Public Activities**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any public activity on the Service. Public activity is any activity that is visible to other users, such as posting a comment, entering a submission in a contest, or uploading a video or photo. Any information that you submit as part of any public activity, including your name, user name or photo, becomes public. Public information may be used by thismoment and the partner on whose behalf thismoment is offering the Service for any online or offline promotional or commercial usage, in any and all media. It is also visible to, and may be used by, any other user of the Service. Thismoment has no obligation to remove any information that you have made available through public activity. You should think carefully before disclosing any personal information in any online public environment. 

**Information Usage**

Here are the ways that we use the information that we collect in connection with your usage of the Service:

  * to provide our Services to you and develop new services;
  * to perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses, including to determine: 
    * how users interact with our Service; 
    * the success of a campaign or promotion being offered by our Partner; 
    * the level of interest in our Partner’s products or Services; 
  

  * to customize the products and services we offer to you and to allow advertising to be served to users based on what we think is most relevant or interesting to them; 
  * to contact you in connection with a contest or sweepstakes or if you have requested to receive information from us or our partner; 
  * to protect the rights, safety or property of thismoment, our partners and our users. 



**Sharing of Personal Information**

This section sets forth the circumstances in which thismoment may share your Personal Information with a third party. 

As mentioned above, thismoment is providing the Service on behalf of the partner whose branding and content are featured in the DEC, and as such acts as a data processor for its partner. Accordingly, all information gathered in connection with your usage of that partner’s DEC, including your Personal Information, will be provided to that partner for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, this information may also be provided to the website through which you are accessing the Service (e.g., Facebook or YouTube). Our partner may also display its own privacy policy through the DEC, in which case our partner may also use the data in any manner permitted by that privacy policy. 

We also contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as web hosting services, application development, analytics, security, and data processing. These companies are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Information and are restricted from using it for any purpose that is incompatible with the uses set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

We may disclose Personal Information to our corporate subsidiaries or affiliates. Any Personal Information provided to thismoment’s subsidiaries or affiliates will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

We may provide Personal Information about you where we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government requirement; (b) enforce any applicable terms of service, (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of thismoment, its partners, its users or the public. 

If thismoment undergoes any merger or sale of its stock or some or all of its assets, we may transfer your Personal Information to the successor entity so long as it continues to maintain that information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected. 

Other than as described in the preceding paragraphs, thismoment will not (a) sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your Personal Information or (b) use your Personal Information for any purpose other than those described in this Privacy Policy, without your consent. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

Any changes to this policy will be posted at this URL: thismoment/privacy. We will not use data we collect in a manner that is materially different from promises made in the version of the Privacy Policy under which it was collected without your consent.

**Updating your Personal Information**

You can contact us by emailing us at [support@thismoment.com](mailto:support@thismoment.com) and we will make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information in order to correct, amend or delete it unless prohibited by law. We may decline to process requests if it would require effort disproportionate to the privacy risk, would violate the rights of others or would prejudice an ongoing legal proceeding or investigation. Because of the way we make back-up copies of our data, residual copies of the information may remain in our backup systems. We also may not be able to delete Personal Information that you have submitted through public activities, and even after removal and it may remain viewable in cached and archived locations or on other websites not within our control. We may charge a reasonable fee to access your Personal Information if to do so would require disproportionate effort. 

Updating or deletion of your Personal Information will not have any effect on other information that thisMoment maintains.

**Security**

We recognize that security is important and take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation or destruction. If you believe that the Personal Information you have provided us has been compromised, or if you become aware of a potential security vulnerability in our Service, please contact us at privacy@thismoment.com.

Thismoment periodically reviews its privacy practices and this Privacy Policy. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns using the contact information provided below and we will investigate and attempt to resolve any concerns or complaints.
