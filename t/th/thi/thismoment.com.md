_Analytics technologies_

We use third party service providers to help us collect, report and analyze information about how users interact with our Service. These providers include Google Analytics ([see privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html)) and Omniture ([see privacy policy](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product)). 

## Information Collected by Third Parties

This Privacy Policy only applies to Thismoment's Services. It does not apply to, and we do not have control over, the sites on which our Services are distributed or products, services or sites that are linked to from within our Service. These sites may place cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. We may also display advertisements on our sites, and in the course of serving the ads, some advertisers and their ad serving partners may place cookies on your computer or may recognize and collect data based on a cookie previously placed on your computer. We do not have access to or control over the data or cookies of these third parties. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy) for more information about how Thismoment uses cookies.

## Public Activities

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any public activity on the Service. Public activity is any activity that is visible to other users, such as posting a comment, entering a submission in a contest, or uploading a video or photo. Any information that you submit as part of any public activity, including your name, user name or photo, becomes public. Public information may be used by Thismoment and the partner on whose behalf Thismoment is offering the Service for any online or offline promotional or commercial usage, in any and all media. It is also visible to, and may be used by, any other user of the Service. Thismoment has no obligation to remove any information that you have made available through public activity. You should think carefully before disclosing any personal information in any online public environment.

## Information Usage

Here are the ways that we use the information that we collect in connection with your usage of the Service:

  * to provide our Services to you and develop new services;
  * to perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses, including to determine:
    * how users interact with our Service;
    * the success of a campaign or promotion being offered by our Partner;
    * the level of interest in our Partner's products or Services;
  * to customize the products and services we offer to you and to allow advertising to be served to users based on what we think is most relevant or interesting to them;
  * to contact you in connection with a contest or sweepstakes or if you have requested to receive information from us or our partner;
  * to protect the rights, safety or property of Thismoment, our partners and our users.



## Sharing of Personal Information

This section sets forth the circumstances in which Thismoment may share your Personal Information with a third party.

We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such as web hosting services, application development, analytics, security, and data processing. These companies are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any Personal Information they receive from us and are restricted from using it for any purpose that is incompatible with the uses set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose Personal Information to our corporate subsidiaries or affiliates. Any Personal Information provided to Thismoment's subsidiaries or affiliates will be treated in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We may provide Personal Information about you where we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or government requirement; (b) enforce any applicable terms of service, (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Thismoment, its partners, its users or the public.

If Thismoment undergoes any merger or sale of its stock or some or all of its assets, we may transfer your Personal Information to the successor entity so long as it continues to maintain that information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which it was collected.

Other than as described in the preceding paragraphs, Thismoment will not (a) sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your Personal Information or (b) use your Personal Information for any purpose other than those described in this Privacy Policy, without your consent.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

Any changes to this policy will be posted at this URL: [https://www.thismoment.com/privacy-policy](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy). We will not use data we collect in a manner that is materially different from promises made in the version of the Privacy Policy under which it was collected without your consent.

## Updating Your Personal Information

You can contact us by emailing us at [support@thismoment.com](mailto:support@thismoment.com) and we will make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Information in order to correct, amend or delete it unless prohibited by law. We may decline to process requests if it would require effort disproportionate to the privacy risk, would violate the rights of others or would prejudice an ongoing legal proceeding or investigation. Because of the way we make back-up copies of our data, residual copies of the information may remain in our backup systems. We also may not be able to delete Personal Information that you have submitted through public activities, and even after removal and it may remain viewable in cached and archived locations or on other websites not within our control. We may charge a reasonable fee to access your Personal Information if to do so would require disproportionate effort.

Updating or deletion of your Personal Information will not have any effect on other information that Thismoment maintains.

## Security

We recognize that security is important and take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation or destruction. If you believe that the Personal Information you have provided us has been compromised, or if you become aware of a potential security vulnerability in our Service, please contact us at [privacy@thismoment.com.](mailto:privacy@thismoment.com)

## Non-U.S. Users

Thismoment is hosted and operated in the United States and is subject to United States law. Any personal information that you provide to us is being provided to us in the United States and will be hosted on United States servers. You consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States. If you are accessing Thismoment from outside the United States, please be advised that United States law may not offer the same privacy protections as the law of your jurisdiction.

Thismoment has certified that it abides by the Safe Harbor Principles developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, storage, use, transfer and other processing of Consumer Personal Data transferred from the European Economic Area or Switzerland to the United States (the "Safe Harbor Principles"). To view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's [website](http://export.gov/safeharbor/).

If you have a complaint about our usage of Personal Information, please contact us at the address provided above under "Comments and Questions." We will investigate and take steps to remedy any violation of the Safe Harbor Principles. If a complaint or dispute under the Safe Harbor Principles cannot be resolved through our internal process, Thismoment has agreed to cooperate with the [European Union Data Protection Authorities](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/eu/index_en.htm) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

This website is intended for use by persons over the age of 13. Thismoment does not seek to collect information about children under the age of 13. No information should be submitted to or posted on this website by users under 13 years of age. Thismoment encourages parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet, and to inform them of the potential dangers of providing information about themselves over the Internet. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us at [support@thismoment.com](mailto:support@thismoment.com)

## Do Not Track

Thismoment does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, some web browsers allow you to set the DNT signal so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.
