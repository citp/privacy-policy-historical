<p>
ThisNext knows that you care about how your personal information is
used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the
following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the
ThisNext Web site, you are accepting the practices outlined in this
Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>

<p>
This Privacy Policy covers ThisNext's treatment of personal
information that ThisNext gathers when you are on the ThisNext Web
site and when you use ThisNext services.
</p>

<p>
This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that
ThisNext does not own or control, or to individuals that ThisNext does
not employ or manage.
</p>

<h2>What Personal Information About Users Does ThisNext Collect?</h2>

<p>
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you
with a friendly, personalized and efficient experience. We only
collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our
Web site. We do not process this information in a way that is
incompatible with the purpose for which it has been collected or
subsequently authorized by you. We collect the following types of
information from our users:
</p>

<p>
   1. Information You Provide to Us:
</p>

<p>
      We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site
      or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide
      us with certain information, but then you may not be able to
      take advantage of various features. The personal information you
      provide is used for such purposes as:
</p>

<p>
          * Registration: In order for you to use ThisNext services,
            such as submitting new product picks or lists to the Web
            site, you must complete a registration form. As part of
            this registration form, we require your email address.
</p>

<p>
   2. Automatic Information:
</p>

<p>
          * We receive and store certain types of information whenever
            you interact with us. ThisNext automatically receives and
            records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from
            your browser including your IP address, ThisNext cookie
            information and the page you requested. ThisNext uses this
            traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers,
            analyze trends and administer the Web site.
</p>

<p>
          * ThisNext may also add on any page display various metrics
            such as number of products, number of lists, number of
            times you have earned feedback or other related
            metrics. This includes member profile pages, logged-in
            homepages, and shopcast lists.
</p>

<p>
</p><h2>Social sharing of data</h2>
<p></p>

<p>
          * ThisNext allows other users to browse product picks and
            shopcast lists that you have created. This information is
            made available via your member profile
            (www.ThisNext.com/by/screenname), on ThisNext badges or on
            the ThisNext blog. ThisNext may choose to post this data
            on other site features in the future.
</p>

<p>
          * Profile information: ThisNext allows other users to browse
            your full name, bio and other profile details should you
            provide this optional information.
</p>

<p>
          * Syndication: ThisNext allows for the RSS syndication of
            all of its public content within the Web site.
</p>

<p>
          * API: ThisNext will allow 3rd parties access to all
            ThisNext data this is already publicly available through
            ThisNext.com. ThisNext will forever keep private passwords
            and blog settings and other personally identifiable
            information.
</p>

<h2>What About Cookies?</h2>

<p>
    * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
      computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
      systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages
      in our Web site are visited and by how many people. ThisNext
      uses cookies to help provide you with a personalized experience
      but we do not share any personally identifiable information with
      third parties.
</p>

<p>
    * The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers
      will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting
      new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you
      receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We
      strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated,
      however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of
      ThisNext's most attractive features.
</p>

<p>
    * Some of our current or future business partners may use cookies
      on ThisNext (for example, advertisers). However, we have no
      access to or control over these cookies.
</p>

<h2>Will ThisNext Share Any of the Information it Receives?</h2>

<p>
Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We
neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone. We share
your personal information only as described below.
</p>

<p>
    * Business Transfers:
</p>

<p>
      In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these
      types of transactions, user information is typically one of the
      business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if ThisNext, or
      substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information
      would be one of the assets that is transferred.
</p>

<p>
   * Protection of ThisNext and Others:
</p>

<p>
      We may release personal information when we believe in good
      faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce
      or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect
      the rights, property or safety of ThisNext, our employees, our
      users or others. This includes exchanging information with other
      companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
      reduction.
</p>

<p>
    * With Your Consent:
</p>

<p>
      Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your
      personal information may be shared with third parties or used
      for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was
      originally collected, and you will be able to prevent the
      sharing of this information by opting out.
</p>

<h2>Is Information About Me Secure?</h2>

<p>
    * Your ThisNext account information is protected by a password for
      your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against
      unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by
      logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.
</p>

<p>
    * Only employees who need personal information to perform a
      specific job (for example, a customer service representative)
      are granted access to it. All of our employees are kept up to
      date on our privacy and security practices.
</p>

<h2>What Information Can I Access?</h2>

<p>
You can access your personal information on our Web site and correct,
amend or delete information that is inaccurate. Upon logging in visit
your user profile setting page located at:
http://www.thisnext.com/edit/profile/
</p>

<h2>What Choices Do I Have?</h2>

<p>
    * As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose
      information, but then you may be unable to use certain features
      on our Web site, such as posting new links.
</p>

<p>
    * You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such
      as those listed in the "What Personal Information About Users
      Does ThisNext Collect?" section above. When you update
      information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised
      information in our records.
</p>

<p>
    * As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the
      majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your
      browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser
      to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully
      disable cookies. Please note, however, that if your browser does
      not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of
      some of our attractive features.
</p>

<h2>Can Children Use ThisNext's Services?</h2>

<p>
You must be 13 years and older to register to use the ThisNext Web
site. As a result, ThisNext does not specifically collect information
about children.
</p>

<h2>Conditions of Use</h2>

<p>
If you decide to visit the ThisNext Web site, your visit and any
possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and
our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of
disputes and application of California state law.
