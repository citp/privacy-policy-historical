Currently, we do not use an SSL certificate because we do not process payments and we do not store user passwords.</p>
<p><b>Do we use cookies?</b><br>
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart.

You do this through your browser (like Chrome or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser’s Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

If you disable cookies off, some features will be disabled. It will turn off some of the features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly.</p>
<p><b>Third-party disclosure.</b><br>

<p><b>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</b><br>
Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet.

<p><b>Fair Information Practices.</b><br>
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
<p>We will notify the users via email within 3 business days.<br>
We will notify the users via in-site notification within 3 business days.</p>
<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
<p><b>CAN SPAM Act.</b><br>
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
<p>We collect email addresses in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send user notifications / updates (example: somebody responds to a post that you created).</li>
<li>To notify users about new features.</li>
<li>Decrease the possibility of “dummy” / fake user accounts.</li>
<li>Send newsletters.</li>
</ul>
