&nbsp;The Services include but are not limited to the Lead Small app, other mobile
applications, and related software and content management systems. Many of the
Sites and Services are directed at church leaders, with some aspects directed
at parents and families as well.&nbsp; As we encourage our users to explore and
interact with the Sites and Services, we also take seriously the obligation to
educate users about how to maintain appropriate privacy when using online
media.&nbsp; Included in this obligation is a commitment to comply fully with
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.&nbsp; The policy below
describes RT's information collection practices for the Sites and the Services.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">This privacy
statement (the "<u>Privacy Policy</u>") applies to all personally identifiable
information (collectively, "<u>Personal Data</u>") and other information that
is collected by RT through the Sites and the Services.&nbsp; Please review this
Privacy Policy carefully before using the Sites or Services.&nbsp; By using any
Site or Service, you consent to these practices.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">What
Information Do We Collect?</span></b></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We collect
Personal Data from you when you subscribe to our curriculum, register for
certain programs, newsletters, and events, download a mobile application or other
Service, or when you voluntarily choose to provide such information, such as
when you purchase products or otherwise enter your Personal Data on a Site or
through a Service. Wherever we collect Personal Data we make an effort to
provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We may also
collect Personal Data from you so that RT may improve its products and provide you
with efficient customer service.&nbsp; From time to time, RT may request
information, including Personal Data, about you and your organization.
Information we may collect includes Personal Data such as names, phone numbers,
postal addresses, and email addresses, as well as demographic information such
as age, gender, and zip code, and information regarding the demographics of
your organization. We also may collect non-personally identifiable technical
data such as your browser type, IP address, domain, access times, installation
data, error and other use codes, and referring web site address. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">By
voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of
it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to us
via a Site or Service, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be
transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of RT and the
authorized third parties referred to herein for the purposes described in this
Privacy Policy. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Information
Collected from Children: </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">RT does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children
under the age of 13 in association with a Site or Service. If you are under the
age of 18, you may only use a Site or Service in the presence of an approving
parent or guardian. Parents may contact us at </span><a href="mailto:customerservice@rethinkgroup.org"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">customerservice@rethinkgroup.org</span></a><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> to request that any
Personal Data provided to us by their child be removed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">The
studio252.tv Site offers children the opportunity to sign up for the Site and
create a "StudioID" and password.&nbsp; To comply with the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act, for users under the age of 13, we collect a parent's
email address, the child's account name, and the child's password during the
initial registration process. We do not collect the child's personal
name.&nbsp; The studio252.tv Site requires child users to provide a parent's
valid email address in order to register on the website.&nbsp; We use this
information to send the parent a message that can be used to activate the <a name="OLE_LINK1"></a><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a>studio252.tv account, to notify the
parent about our privacy practices, to send the parent communications either
about studio252.tv accounts or about features of the Site, and for the other
purposes described in this Privacy Policy. The child's account is not activated
until the parent completes this registration process.&nbsp; The parent's email
address is correlated with the "StudioID" user name.&nbsp; Parents are required
to approve all changes to the account and are given access to view all
information correlated with the "StudioID," including analytics regarding what
the child has viewed on the Site.&nbsp; Children may vote for content they like
and otherwise interact with the Site through their "StudioID." Parents may at
any time cancel the child's account and ask that RT remove Personal Data
associated with their child's "StudioID."&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Posting
Content:&nbsp; </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Certain
Sites and Services offer families the opportunity to upload their images,
videos, stories, and other content to share with other users of the Site or
Service.&nbsp; The parent is required to log in to the Site or Service to
upload any such content, which is stored and displayed in connection with the
designated account or "StudioID."&nbsp; Children are not permitted to upload
such content themselves.&nbsp; You acknowledge by uploading such content that you
own copyright to the content uploaded, that other users of the Site or Service
are permitted to view the content, and that RT may use the content on the Site
or Service and in promotional and marketing materials related to the Sites,
Services, or RT.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Testimonials:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp; The
testimonials section of the Sites and Services is for the purpose of sharing
positive experiences. RT may moderate the testimonials section to ensure
accurate and positive testimonials. Published testimonials are genuine but RT
reserves the right to edit or alter testimonials for items including but not
limited to spelling, grammar, length, or appropriateness. RT reserves the right
to post or remove any testimonial at its discretion.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Offers: </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">From time-to-time we
may give you the opportunity to opt in to offers from unaffiliated third
parties that we deem valuable. If you decide to accept these offers, we will
provide your Personal Data to the applicable third party. However, you should
note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to Personal Data that you permit
us to give to unaffiliated third parties. Any information users give to another
party is governed by the rules of that party's privacy policy, which may differ
from this Privacy Policy. RT is not responsible for information given to other
parties. Please review their privacy policies prior to providing any
information to third parties.</span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Log Files:
</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">We
use IP addresses to analyze trends and use of content, administer the Sites and
Services, evaluate content of and for RT curriculum and products, track user
movements and interaction with content in the Sites and Services, and gather
broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to
Personal Data and are not themselves considered Personal Data. </span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Security:&nbsp;
</span></strong><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">At
RT we take the issue of security very seriously.&nbsp; It is a top priority to
ensure that all current and future information collected from our users is
secure.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are careful to maintain commercial standards in
electronic security and password protection. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">On-line
Polls and Surveys:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">
Occasionally we collect poll or survey responses to find out what RT users
think, or for statistical or research purposes. Our polls and surveys do not
collect, nor are they linked to, any Personal Data, and they are voluntary. The
results of our demographic and opinion surveys are grouped and analyzed as a
whole - in the aggregate. RT may share this aggregated information with other
parties. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Using
"Cookie" Technology: </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">&nbsp;We use a software technology called
"cookies" to collect non-personal information about our visitors.
Such information includes: type of browser software a visitor uses to access
the Internet (i.e. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape, etc.); type of
operating system (i.e. Windows, Macintosh, etc.); or the domain name of the
visitor's Internet service provider. We also count the number of visitors who
come to our site each day in an aggregate form. Such information allows us to
better assess which attractions are best meeting our audience's needs. We also
use "cookie" technology to track and provide visitor scores on
designated contests and multi-player games. </span></p>

<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">Independent Contractors:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp; RT may use
certain independent contractors and other third parties to operate components
of the Sites or Services, fulfill orders, and assist RT in operating and
improving the Sites or Services.&nbsp; In this capacity, RT may allow these
independent contractors and third parties to collect the information, including
Personal Data, described in this Privacy Policy for RT.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Notification
of Changes:&nbsp; </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">From
time to time we may make changes to our Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we
will post them on the Sites to make users aware of what the changes are so
users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and
when we may disclose it. A user is bound by any changes to the policy when she
or he uses the Sites or Services after those changes have been posted.&nbsp;
If, however, we are going to use users' Personal Data in a manner materially
different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify by posting
a notice on our Sites for 30 days. </span></p>
