You
acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Sites’ Terms of
Use, and by accessing or using our Sites, you agree to be bound by all
of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please
do not access or use our Sites.<br>
<br>
We reserve the right to change
this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes will be reflected by the
Effective Date above. We encourage you to visit and review this Privacy
Policy to stay abreast of any changes. In general we use your personal
information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect at
the time we receive your personal information. Your continued use of
the Sites after such modifications will constitute your: (a)
acknowledgment of the modified Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and
be bound by the modified Policy. However, if changes to this Privacy
Policy will be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of
the personal information you provided us, we will attempt to obtain
your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such
information.<br>
<br>
Please note that any document or other content posted at the direction

Policy.

<h2>1. What information do we collect from you?</h2>
<p>
In
order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two
types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable
Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary
goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a
smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our Sites.
</p>
<p>
Personally
Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know
the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on
our Sites, such as registering for a membership, ordering a product or
service, submitting credit card information, submitting content and/or
posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a
contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback,
we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling
out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to
engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities,
however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as
your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email
address, employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile
numbers, and other personal identifying information. When ordering
products or services on the Sites, you may be asked to provide a credit
card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we
ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If
you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular
activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
</p>
<p>
Non-Personally
Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by
itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information
about you based upon where you visit on our Sites in several ways. This
information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an
aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform
Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you go to
next, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP")
address. An URL is the global address of documents and other resources
on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or
device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP")
network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the
TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the
destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is
automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the
web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer.
Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the
Internet.
</p>
<div class="link_top">
<a href="privacy.jsp#top">TOP</a>
</div>
<a name="2" title="2"></a>
<h2>2. Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</h2>
<p>
We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.
</p>
<p>
Any
personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online
(on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public
profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and
used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is displayed
to other users when you upload documents or send messages through the
ThinkFree Sites and other users can contact you through messages and
comments. Any documents that you submit to the ThinkFree Sites may be
redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be
viewed by the general public.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we may also
collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may
collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This
information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and,
in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose
problems with our servers, software, to administer our Sites and to
gather demographic information. Our third party ad servers will also
provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us
how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our Sites.
</p>
<p>
We
will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide
our services to you, as required by our agreements with you. We will
also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation
of our Sites, fill orders, improve our marketing and promotional
efforts, statistically analyze site use, improve our product and
service offerings, and customize our Sites' content, layout, and
services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver
information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices.
We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve
disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you,
including our Sites’ Terms of Use, Sales Terms and Conditions, and this
Private Policy.
</p>
<div class="link_top">
<a href="privacy.jsp#top">TOP</a>
</div>
<a name="3" title="3"></a>
<h2>3. With whom do we share your information?</h2>
<p>
We
do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to
others. We do provide some of our services through contractual
arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners and other
third parties. We and our service partners use your Personally
Identifiable Information to operate our Sites and to deliver their
services. For example, we must release your credit card information to
the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services
purchased on our Sites; release your address information to the
delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide
order information to third parties that help us provide customer
service.
</p>
<p>
We will encourage our service partners to adopt
and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally
Identifiable Information by our service partners is governed by the
privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our
control.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally we may be required by law
enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable
Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will
disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court
order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.
We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those
who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to
report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith
believe to be unlawful.
</p>
<p>
We may also provide
Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' sales,
traffic patterns, and related site information to third party
advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally
Identifiable Information.
</p>
<p>
We also reserve the right to
disclose Personally Identifiable information and/or Non-Personally
Identifiable information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate
or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use , take precautions against
liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party
claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to
protect the security or integrity of our web Sites, and to protect the
rights, property, or personal safety of ThinkFree, our users or others.

<h2>4. How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information?</h2>
<p>
We
believe you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally
Identifiable Information that you have provided to us. You may change
any of your Personally Identifiable Information in your account online
at any time by linking to your account in accordance with instructions
posted elsewhere on our Sites. You may also access and correct your
personal information and privacy preferences by writing us at:<br>
<br>
ThinkFree, Inc.<br>
ATTN:  USER ACCOUNTS<br>
3003 North First Street<br>
San Jose, CA 95134<br>
<br>
Please include your name, address, and/or e-mail address when you contact us.
</p>
<p>
We
encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable
Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your
account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past
transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past
transactions on our Sites. In addition, it may be impossible to
completely delete your information without some residual information
because of backups.
</p>
<div class="link_top">
<a href="privacy.jsp#top">TOP</a>
</div>
<a name="5" title="5"></a>
<h2>5. What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?</h2>
<p>
We
may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our products and
services. If you do not wish to receive such emails, please edit your
account information to no longer receive such emails.
</p>
<p>
You
also have choices with respect to cookies, as described below. By
modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all
cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies.
If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our Sites may not
work properly in your case.
</p>

</div>
<a name="6" title="6"></a>
<h2>6. What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</h2>
<p>
The
importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information
associated with our user is of utmost concern to us. Your Personally
Identifiable Information is protected in several ways.
</p>
<p>
We
use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal
information.
</p>
<p>
Access by you to your Personally
Identifiable Information is available through a password and unique
customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend
that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
</p>
<p>
In order
to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order
fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing
agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information
needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment
information and to process and ship your order.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately,
no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect
your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) We
cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit
to us and you do so at your own risk; (b) there are security and
privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b)
the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data
exchanged between you and us through our Sites cannot be guaranteed;
and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in
transit by a third party.
</p>

</div>
<a name="7" title="7"></a>
<h2>7. Do we use "cookies"?</h2>
<p>
When
you use our Sites we will store cookies on your computer in order to
facilitate and customize your use of our Sites. A cookie is a small
data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive
(if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify
you to us. Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification
numbers, the country where you are located, and your first name to
welcome you back to our Sites. The cookies make your use of the Sites
easier, make the Sites run more smoothly and help us to maintain a
secure site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser
permits, but some parts of our Sites may not work properly in that case.
</p>
<p>
We
may use an outside ad serving company to display banner advertisements
on our Sites. As part of their service, they will place a separate
cookie on your computer. We will not provide any third-party ad server
with any of your Personally Identifiable Information or information
about your purchases. We and our third party ad server will collect and
use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP
address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the
area code and zip code associated with your server and whether you
responded to a particular ad. Other advertisers may also place banner
ads on our Sites in the same manner as above, but we will not disclose
any Personally Identifiable Information to them.

<h2>8. What should you know about privacy policies and data collection at any third party sites accessible from our Sites?</h2>
<p>
Except
as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only
addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.
Other sites accessible through our Sites have their own privacy
policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please
consult each site's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the
policies or practices of third parties. Additionally, other companies
which place advertising on our Sites may collect information about you
when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies.
We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact
these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of
the information that they collect.

<h2>9. What else should you know about your privacy online?</h2>
<p>
Protecting
the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason,
we do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable
information or non-personally-identifiable information on the ThinkFree
Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is
directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then
please do not use or access the Thinkfree Sites at any time or in any
manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information of persons
under 13 years of age has been collected on the ThinkFree Sites without
verified parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to
delete this information.
</p>
<p>
The ThinkFree Sites are hosted
in the United States and are intended for and directed to users in the
United States. If you are a user accessing the ThinkFree Sites from the
European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations
governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ
from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued
use of the ThinkFree Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, this
Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use , you are transferring your
personal information to the United States and you consent to that
transfer.
</p>
<p>
In the event that ThinkFree is acquired by or
merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these
circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected
from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other
change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting
creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your
personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
</p>
<div class="link_top">
<a href="privacy.jsp#top">TOP</a>
</div>
<p>
You
should also be aware that when Personally Identifiable Information is
voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, e-mail address, etc.) in the
discussion forums or other public areas on our Sites, that information,
along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be
collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited
messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and
this Policy does not apply to such information. Any submissions to chat
rooms or other public areas on our Sites are accepted with the
understanding that they are accessible to all third parties. If you do
not want your comments to be viewed by third parties, you are advised
not to make any submissions. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for
maintaining the secrecy of your password and/or account information.
Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practice of the
Sites, or your dealings with the Sites, please contact us at
