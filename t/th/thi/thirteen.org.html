				<p><strong>Thank You</strong><br>
for visiting Thirteen.org. As an extension of our broadcast mission we want your visit to Thirteen.org to enlighten, inform and entertain you. Thirteen/WNET New York is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its online guests, Members, donors, and friends. We believe that maintaining the highest standards of privacy on the Web is crucial to maintaining your trust in Thirteen. For this reason, we want to inform our visitors about the types of information we collect and how we use that information.</p>
<p><strong>Information You Give Us</strong><br>
To participate in some activities, such as any Sweepstakes that we feature on our site, you may be asked to provide some personal identification information. If you do not want this information to be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply choose not to submit your information. However, this may prevent your participation in these activities. Thirteen will ask your permission before using your email address for Thirteen communications and will always give you a clear and convenient method of unsubscribing to our mailings.</p>
<p><strong>1. When You Make a Membership Pledge</strong><br>
Thirteen will ask you to provide the information necessary to process and service your membership Pledge: name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number. This information is encrypted for your security and is only seen by our membership staff who processes your gift and our contracted fulfillment agencies.</p>
<p><strong>2. When You Complete an Online Survey</strong><br>
Thirteen occasionally posts surveys on its site. These surveys, which are completely voluntary, may ask about your interests, occupation, educational background, and so on. We use this information only to understand our members and viewers better and to determine how best to serve them. Specific information collected in surveys is never shared with third parties.</p>
<p><strong>3. Information Collected Automatically</strong><br>
Our server tracks how you and other visitors use the site, identifying the source of visitors to Thirteen.org and what pages they use on our site. By looking at this “traffic” we can better understand our community, which allows us to improve our web site and to provide you with an optimal experience and better service.</p>
<p>In order to provide this optimal service and convenience we use “cookies.” A cookie is a temporary code placed in your computer by our server that facilitates communication and saves you time when you browse our web site. Cookies are completely anonymous and help us serve you. When you make a pledge, this information keeps track of items you add to your pledge basket so you can continue to browse our web site until you are ready to check out. At no time does the cookie reveal your name, address, or telephone number (even if you have entered these in other areas of Thirteen.org). You always have the ability to disengage the cookie software on your browser without limiting your ability to make a pledge securely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Email</strong><br>
We regularly send email Program Guides to our registered members and visitors with information about Thirteen programs, services or membership opportunities. If you do not wish to receive any email from Thirteen, indicate your preference on the pledge form when making a pledge or send an email message with your name to <a href="mailto:membership@thirteen.org">membership@thirteen.org</a>. We will do our best to make your change in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Thirteen never sells, exchanges or lends to third parties any email or telephone information you provide when making a Membership Pledge or subscribing to our online Program Guide.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
Thirteen makes every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur on its Web site are secure. All credit card numbers submitted to the site are encrypted using “Secure Socket Layer” (SSL) encryption, which is the industry standard for information security and is used by more than 100,000 Web sites in more than fifty countries. Any personal information you submit with your pledge is encrypted and completely secure. Even in the unlikely event that the information you send is intercepted it will not be usable by anyone else.</p>
<p>Your peace of mind and safeguarding is very important to us. If you do not feel comfortable submitting your personal information online you can make your pledge by calling us at 1-800-272-1313.</p>
<p><strong>How Thirteen Uses This Information</strong><br>
Thirteen uses the information you provide to fulfill your Membership pledge (see When You Make a Membership Pledge) and to keep you informed of Station events and programs. Our staff uses your credit card information to process your pledge and our fulfillment agencies use your address information to mail you your gift. When you enroll in any sweepstakes featured on our site, independent sweepstakes judges use your information for the sole purposes of selecting and notifying winners.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Thirteen may share the information you provide when you register or make a membership pledge online (your name and your postal address) with other carefully selected organizations. In no event will Thirteen sell, rent, lease, lend, trade, give, donate, transfer, or otherwise exchange, the station’s membership lists with, or acquire such lists from, any candidate for public office, committees or organizations supporting a candidate, political parties, or organizations that solicit funds for use in political campaigns.</p>
<p>If you would prefer not to have your information shared in this way, contact us via email at <a href="mailto:membership@thirteen.org">membership@thirteen.org</a> or at the postal address or telephone number listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Kids</strong><br>
Thirteen takes great pride in the responsible and quality content we provide for children. Your continued trust is even more important as kids gain more access to the internet. For this reason we will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from your child. We believe taking this precaution will help ensure the safety, value and enjoyment of your child’s visits to our web site. In the event that your child completes an enrollment form on Thirteen’s website and Thirteen learns that your child is under the age of thirteen, we will seek to obtain your permission to retain such information by postal mail or telephone. Thirteen, with your permission, would use your child’s name, address and email address to process your child’s membership pledge, fulfill a request for an email newsletter subscription or other informational activities.</p>
<p>Thirteen may also share your child’s personally identifiable information for marketing purposes with other carefully selected non-profit and commercial organizations, who have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the information they obtain from Thirteen. You may stipulate that your child’s name not be exchanged with other organizations by calling our Member and Viewer Relations department at (212) 560-2888.</p>
<p>Thirteen will not condition your child’s participation in any activity on the child’s disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such an activity. You may, at any time, review and have deleted your child’s personally identifiable information and refuse to permit further collection or the use of such information by calling our Member and Viewer Relations department at (212) 560-2888.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing Information You have Submitted</strong><br>
You have a right to know what personal information you have submitted to us and to notify us of any corrections. If you want to request that information or if you have any questions about this privacy policy, Thirteen’s online practices, or your Thirteen Membership account, please feel free to contact us:</p>

Email: <a href="mailto:membership@thirteen.org">membership@thirteen.org</a><br>
Telephone: 212-560-2888</p>

If you email Thirteen, your message and email address will be forwarded to the appropriate department within the station. Please feel free to contact us either by telephone or email with any type of question. We will make sure your question or comment reaches the appropriate person.</p>
