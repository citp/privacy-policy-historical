                            <p>ThinkWave, Inc. is committed to safeguarding personal information online. This information is accessible only by individual parent and student ThinkWave ID's and passwords. ThinkWave will not knowingly and directly ask any student for any personally identifiable information, nor will it require any such information for a student to use or access ThinkWave. However, in order to assist the district, school, or teacher (together the "Staff") in school administration and to track its students’ progress, ThinkWave, at the School’s sole option, allows the Staff (not the student) to input the students’ names. It is up to the Staff to register students to give them access to ThinkWave by proving students and parents with the Start Keys generated by ThinkWave. The students and parents then create their own login and password and attach the Start Key to their account. The Staff, and not ThinkWave, solely control, defines and manages the collection, disclosure, communication, management and use of all data, including personal data on this Site. ThinkWave assumes no responsibility to enter, collect, or review any such data.</p>
