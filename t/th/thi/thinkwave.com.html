                <h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>ThinkWave, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our members. 
					Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will 
					be treated as you use our service. The policy may be updated occasionally so please 
					check back periodically.</p>
					
					<p>To ensure our members privacy and the security of their information, ThinkWave,
					 Inc. has taken the following precautions:</p>
					
					<p></p><ul class="double-arrow">
						<li><span class="fontsize5">» &nbsp;</span>ThinkWave, Inc. uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to enhance
						the privacy of grades and class results transmitted online.</li>
						
						<li><span class="fontsize5">» &nbsp;</span>We will not sell or share any personal information with any person or organization outside of ThinkWave, Inc.</li>
										
						<li><span class="fontsize5">» &nbsp;</span>ThinkWave accounts are password-protected. (Members are responsible for maintaining 
						the security of passwords.)</li>
						
						<li><span class="fontsize5">» &nbsp;</span>ThinkWave hosts its data on Google App Engine cloud-computing platform and ThinkWave abides by the privacy policies of Google which are incorporated herein by this reference: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html">http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
<h2>Security</h2>
                
<p>ThinkWave, Inc. uses individual password-protected accounts and Secure Socket Layer 
(SSL) encryption technology to enhance the privacy of grades and class results transmitted 
online.</p>

<p>ThinkWave accounts are all password-protected so that only authorized members are 
allowed to access or view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend 
that you do not divulge your password to anyone. ThinkWave does not ask you for your 
password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for 
maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.  Regretfully, no 
data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed completely secure. Given the inherent 
operation and structure of the Internet, all transmissions are done at your own risk.</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>ThinkWave, Inc. is committed to safeguarding personal information online. This 
information is accessible only by individual parent and student ThinkWave ID's 
and passwords. ThinkWave will not knowingly and directly ask any student for any 
personally identifiable information, nor will it require any such information for a 
student to use or access ThinkWave. However, in order to assist the district, school, 
or teacher (together the "Staff") in school administration and to track its students’ 
progress, ThinkWave, at the School’s sole option, allows the Staff (not the student) to 
input the students’ names. It is up to the Staff to register students to give them access 
to ThinkWave by proving students and parents with the Start Keys generated by ThinkWave. 
The students and parents then create their own login and password and attach the Start 
Key to their account. The Staff, and not ThinkWave, solely control, defines and manages 
the collection, disclosure, communication, management and use of all data, including 
personal data on this Site.  ThinkWave assumes no responsibility to enter, collect, or 
review any such data.</p>


<h2>Privacy</h2>
