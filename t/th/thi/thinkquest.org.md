We respect the privacy of visitors to our Web site and the privacy of participants in ThinkQuest programs. In order for you to understand what information we may collect, why we collect it, how we use the information the following explanation is offered. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**   
We will not collect personal information about any visitor to our Web site, unless the visitor is made aware that we are collecting such information. An example of personal information we do collect, is information that can be used to add a visitor to an email list or a mailing list. Personal information is also collected about participants in our programs, for the purposes of administering those programs and communicating with the participants. 

We will not make personal information available to outside organizations, except for organizations that work with us on the ThinkQuest programs. In that case, such personal information is used only for purposes related to the ThinkQuest programs. 

When requested, we will remove a person from our email list or mailing list. Please see the section explaining the procedure below. 

**Automatically-Collected or Stored Information**   
For each visitor to our Web site, certain information, such as identifying information from your Internet Service Provider and Web browser, is collected automatically. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to gather broad demographic information. 

For the convenience of our visitors, we may store bits of information inside your computer. These bits of information are known as "cookies". We may use these "cookies" to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

**The ThinkQuest Library of Entries**   
The ThinkQuest Library entries are made up of Web pages prepared by our contestants. Additionally, many of the entries have functions which allow visitors to the site to contribute content, as a result, we have no ability to control the privacy practices of each entry. When a violation of our privacy practices, normal network etiquette, good taste, or other undesirable activity by one of our contributors is brought to our attention, we will take appropriate action to address the issue.
