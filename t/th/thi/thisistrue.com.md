# Privacy and Security Statement: Randy Cassingham's Weird News

**We _hate_ junk mail!** "Spam" mail is the bane of the Internet. If you aren't bothered by it, you probably will be soon. We **refuse** to add to this illegitimate use of the Internet: we not only **_will not_** provide your e-mail address to _any_ advertiser, we actually work rather hard to keep it secret. Your address will _not_ be revealed to anyone who is not an employee of _This is True._

We further protect your privacy and e-mail security in general by requiring that new subscribers "confirm" or "verify" their subscription request. This prevents people from harassing others by subscribing them to something they may not want. When you subscribe, we send a message asking you to confirm your subscription. You _must_ click the link in this message before your subscription will be activated. Of course, you may always cancel (or "unsubscribe") at any time: there is a link at the bottom of _every issue_ to make it easy ([details](http://www.thisistrue.com/change.html)).

_This is True_ has been proactive in educating Internet users about what spam is, why it's bad, and what can be done about it. We encourage you to learn more -- the more you know about spam and e-mail scams, the less likely _you_ will be victimized by them. Please visit our [spam primer](http://www.spamprimer.com/) (offsite: opens in a new window).

**In addition,** since our company's formation in 1983, it has also been our policy to never sell customer _postal_ addresses, either. So if you buy our [Premium subscriptions](http://www.thisistrue.com/upgrade.html), our [book collections](http://www.thisistrue.com/books.html), or any other item, the information you provide us to deliver them is _also_ kept confidential. We miss out on profit opportunities by not selling our customer addresses, but that's how _we_ want to be treated by the companies we do business with, so that's how we treat our customers. Simple, eh?

**Terms of Service:** _This is True_ 's free edition is offered without charge for your personal use. In return for your free subscription, you agree to abide by the terms of the copyright notice included in each issue, _and_ you agree that you are responsible for maintaining your own subscription, including changing your own address or stopping your subscription when you choose. Unsubscribe links are included in every issue.

**Comments and Letters to the Editor:** _All comments, whether sent by e-mail or posted on this site, become the property of ThisIsTrue.Inc and may be published_. Comments will be published at our sole discretion. Once published, any editing of comments shall be at our sole discretion, including removing comments for any reason. Comments on the site will be removed in the case of spam, off-topic posts, "flaming", invasion of others' privacy or other legal reasons, or if they do not materially contribute to the discussion at hand. We ask that you include your first name and location, and these may be added by us if you fail to do so. Publication in our newsletters may include your name and location, but will _not_ include your e-mail address, and may (or may not) be edited for length or clarity.

**Underage Subscribers:** _This is True_ is designed for adults and well-educated, older teens. Kids under 13 will not likely get the humor or irony, and we do not knowingly accept subscriptions for pre-teens. Any pre-teens discovered on our distribution will be deleted. Any particularly brainy kids that want to read _True_ should ask a parent to subscribe, and then ask to read their parent's copy.

**Cookies:** The site -- and the advertisers who make this free service possible -- may use cookies or "web beacons" to get statistics on who sees what ads, whether you click on the ads, etc.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of specific interest to you.

Google is one of these third-party vendors, and they use cookies to serve ads here. Google uses a special [DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) that enables it to serve ads to you based upon your visit to this site and others that you visit.

If you don't want to have this DART cookie on your computer, you can [opt out](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). We feel you'll be making a mistake by doing that, as you'll then see ads for random goods or services that won't be of much use to you.

**Note Regarding Online Credit Card Security:** We use industry-standard SSL security on all our online order forms. Any data entered by customers, including credit card numbers, are processed immediately _and are not kept_ on file by us for _any_ length of time. We are _quite_ serious about the security of your data, and use the best methods available to us. We simply use what _we_ expect from the online merchants we buy things from.
