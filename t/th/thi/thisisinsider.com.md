**3\. Information We Collect About You**

Business Insider gathers information about its users mainly to enhance their experience on the Sites. This information is used to bring you content that is relevant to your interests. Additionally, Business Insider, along with our advertising partners, collects information about you anonymously to provide you with targeted advertising messages that are catered to your location, interests, and the Sites behaviors. You can opt out of information gathering for advertising purposes with certain of our third-party partners below. This collected information includes 1) personal information you provide to us and 2) non-personal information we automatically collect through technology. 

     a. Personal Information You Provide To Business Insider 

When using the Sites, you may provide Business Insider with PII, including but not limited to:

  * Correspondence with Business Insider staff 
  * Billing Information (for paid Business Insider products) 
  * Contact information for Business Insider event tickets 



You may also provide information to be published or displayed on public areas of the Sites (“User Contributions”). Your User Contributions are posted on the Sites at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Sites who view your User Contributions or with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. 

If you are a Registered User and under the age of 18 years old, Business Insider allows you to request removal of your User Contributions. For more information on the removal of User Contributions, see our [Terms of Use](http://www.businessinsider.com/terms). 

You are not required to provide Business Insider with any PII in order to use the Sites. Certain PII you provide to us can be updated through the account settings of registered users. PII that is collected is the sole property of Business Insider, and that information is not distributed to third parties unless required by law. 

     b. Non-Personal Information We Automatically Collect About You 

This type of information is collected anonymously through the use of technology, such as third-party cookies, web beacons, and other similar methods. No PII is collected through these methods. Non-personal information we automatically collect may include, but is not limited to:

  * Analytics information (time spent on the Sites, number of pages viewed, referring web page, browsing information, social sharing, etc.) 
  * Advertising information (type of ads seen, number of times ads were served, pages where the ads were served, etc.)

  * Business Insider may need to disclose PII to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or any other legal process. 
  * We employ third-party services to distribute email newsletters, and these third-parties have access to specific information only for the purposes of fulfilling contracts on our behalf. 
  * In the event Business Insider goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users’ PII will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.
