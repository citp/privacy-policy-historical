		</ul>
		
		<p>In addition, independent Thirty-One Gifts Consultants may provide us personal information about individuals who are invited to hosted Thirty-One Gifts parties.</p>

		<p>Types of personal information collected or provided may include your name, address, email address, home, work and mobile telephone number, payment information, as well as other information you chose to provide which can identify you personally. Additionally, if you apply to become an independent Thirty-One Gifts Consultant we will collect your birthday and social security number. </p>

		<p>Once we receive personal information through our Marketing Channels, we use it for such things as:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>processing orders and requests;</li>
			<li>improving and developing our products, and services, Websites and Mobile Applications; </li>
			<li>communicating with you regarding promotional offers, new products, and other information that we think may be interesting to you;</li>
			<li>analyzing your activity with us, including interaction with our Marketing Channels and your purchases;</li>
			<li>personalizing our communications to you; </li>

		<h4>Information Observed or Collected Through Technology.</h4>

		<h5>What Type of Technologies Are Used?</h5>
		
		<p>We and our third party service providers use technology to automatically observe and collect information whenever you interact with our Websites or Mobile Applications and when you open our emails.  The following describe some of the types of technology used:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Navigational Information.</strong>  We collect navigational information such as browser type and version; the service provider used to access our Websites or Mobile Applications; whether visitors arrived through a link for our Websites; and for visitors using a mobile version of our Websites or a Mobile Application, technical information about the device used, such as screen size, cookie support by the device and how images may appear.   </li>
			<li><strong>Cookies.</strong>  Cookies assign a unique identification to your computer and are typically stored on your computer's hard drive by your web browser.</li>
			<li><strong>Pixel Tag.</strong>  A pixel tag (also known as Web beacons, Web bugs and clear GIFs) is a nearly invisible small  graphic image on a webpage or in an email message.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>How Do We Use Information Gathered Through Technology?</h5>
		
		<p>Information gathered through technology allows us to determine such things as which parts of our Websites are most visited or used, what products are browsed and/or purchased, the effectiveness of our Websites, possibly the city from which devices connect to our Websites, and difficulties visitors may experience in accessing our Websites.  Cookies are also used to associate you with your independent Thirty-One Gifts Consultant, keep track of items you put into your shopping cart, and to tell us whether you have visited our Websites in the past.  Pixel tags in emails help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails.</p>
		
		<h3 id="coverage">What information is not covered by this privacy policy?</h3>
		
		<p>This privacy policy does not cover personal information about Consultants submitted by Thirty-One Gifts Consultants through their virtual office on mythirtyone.com/ mythirtyone.ca or through an online channel such as a mobile application for Consultant use or through thirtyoneconference.com.  Rather, the Consultant Agreement will control with respect to personal information submitted by and about a Thirty-One Gifts Consultant through these methods.</p>

		<h3 id="sharing">What information do we share with third parties?</h3>

		<p>We will share your personal information with our affiliates.  In addition, we will share your personal information with the independent Thirty-One Gifts Consultants(s) with whom you indicate you have a relationship.  If you do not have a relationship with one of our independent Thirty-One Gifts Consultants, we will select one who is located near you and provide your contact information to that independent Thirty-One Gifts Consultant so you may be contacted about your inquiry.</p>
		
		<p>We may share your personal information with third party service providers that assist us in such things as: developing and administering our Websites; conducting surveys, sweepstakes or contests; sending and administering emails or text messages; performing marketing services; or other similar services.  </p>

		<p>If we were ever merged with or acquired by another company or sold substantially all of our assets, or if we acquire another business entity or substantially all of its assets or we are involved in a corporate reorganization or other change of control, some or all of the personal information collected about you could be shared with this entity, and it may also be retained by us. </p>

		<p>We will not otherwise share, sell, distribute, or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our Marketing Channels, the Marketing Channels or the public.</p>

		<p>Nothing in this policy restricts our ability to share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you.</p>

		<h3 id="choices">What choices do you have over how your information is used?</h3>

		<p><strong>Marketing Email:</strong>  You may elect to no longer receive marketing emails from us or that we send on behalf of one of our independent Thirty-One Gifts Consultants. You may opt out of these marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in any marketing email you receive.  You may also adjust your preferences on our <a href="http://pages.e.thirtyonegifts.com/manage-email-preferences/">Email Subscription Center</a>. Please be aware, however, even if you opt out of marketing emails, you may still receive emails related to your transactions, such as order confirmations and may still receive emails directly from your independent Thirty-One Gifts Consultants that we do not send on behalf of the Consultant.</p>

		<p><strong>Text Message Marketing:</strong>  If you no longer want to receive text messages from us, you can follow the opt-out instructions provided at the time you sign up for text messages or the instructions that may be included in the text messages you receive.</p>

		<p>We do not sell products for purchase by children.  Our Marketing Channels are directed to adults and are not directed to children under the age of 13.  The Company does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. </p>

		<h3 id="you-update">How can you update your personal information? </h3>

		<p>If you believe that any information we have collected about you is incorrect or incomplete, then please email or write to our Privacy Manager at the contact information below , letting us know the correct information.</p>

		<h3 id="we-update">How will we update our Privacy Policy?</h3> 

		<p>We reserve the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason.  If we ever change our Privacy Policy, then we will post the new policy on this page so that you are always aware of the information that we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.  Should there be a material change to our Privacy Policy, it will be applied only to the information we collect after the effective date of the change. </p>

		<h3 id="protect">How do we protect your information?</h3>

		<p>Our Online Channels use the following types of security measures:  firewall technology, limited access servers, and when you place an order online, we require use of Web browsers that permit communication through secure-socket-layer (SSL) technology.  SSL is encryption technology that provides security for information as it is being sent over the Internet. </p>

		<h3 id="questions">Where should you direct your questions?</h3>

		<p>If you have questions or concerns with respect to our Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact our Privacy Manager at <a href="mailto:privacy@thirtyonegifts.com">privacy@thirtyonegifts.com</a>or via mail at:</p>
