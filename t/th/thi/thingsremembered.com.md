## Mailing Lists

From time to time, we make our mailing list (including names and addresses only) and general shopping activities available to carefully selected companies whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you and whose privacy practices meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards. We do not share email addresses for this purpose. If you do not wish to receive mailings from these carefully selected companies, simply call Customer Service at 866.902.4438.

## Security of Your Information

Rest assured that we utilize the latest encryption technology to ensure the safety of your personal information at Things Remembered. Your ordering information (name, address, credit card, etc.) is encrypted during the ordering process & transmission, using our secure server to provide the highest level of security possible. In addition, once received, your credit card data is stored on a server that cannot be accessed via the Internet.

We further protect your information using the following methods:

  


  * **Password protection:** When you create an account with us, your password creates another level of security for your personal information. Your password is your secret code into your account. Make your password a combination of at least 6 (no more than 10) characters/numbers that are not easily guessed (don't make your password your last name, for example). 
  * **Site protection:** Our entire site is protected behind an advanced firewall (think of it as a cyber fortress), which prevents unauthorized persons from accessing your information.

## How We Use Your Email Address

We are proud to be 100% compliant with the 2004 Can SPAM act, meaning that we do not send unsolicited email to our customers.

At Things Remembered, your email address is used in the following ways: 

  


  * Order and Shipment Confirmation Emails: When you place an order, we will send you an email that indicates that we have received your order (order confirmation) and a later email that indicates that your order has been shipped (shipment confirmation). 
  * Email Newsletters and Promotions: When you provide your email address to us at thingsremembered.com, you will be asked if you want to receive special offers from us via email. If you indicate that you do not want to receive email offers from us, rest assured that you will not receive information from us.
