**Our privacy policy  
**

Your trust is our most important asset. So at This Is London we are very serious about protecting your privacy. If we ask for information about you, we take all possible steps to keep it safe.

We collect personal information from our users to provide them with a range of services, to increase the efficiency of our sites, to identify personal preferences, for market research and for record keeping purposes. 

We may use this information to tell you of changes to the site (and any changes to this policy will be posted here).

We may also use the information to communicate with you and to let you know about products and services in which you may be interested, from Associated New Media, from other Daily Mail & General Trust companies and from carefully chosen, reputable and trustworthy third parties. This will only be done with your consent.

With your consent, we may supply personal information to third parties. We may also provide them with overall statistics about customers and visitors to our site. The latter will not include information that could personally identify you.

We reserve the right to access and to disclose personal information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate our systems properly or to protect either ourselves or our users.

We guarantee this for all ANM websites - UK Plus, Femail, This Is Money, This Is London, Under One Roof and Big Blue Dog. This may not be the case for other sites we link to.

#### What information do we need?

**1** To provide the services you want, we need to know your interests. We find out by asking you, by reading your comments and by looking at which are the most popular areas of the site. This may involve the use of cookies - small snippets of data stored on your computer by your web browser. Cookies help us deliver more personal service when you visit us again

**2** If you enter a contest or promotion we ask for your name, address and email address. This is so we can run the contest effectively and tell you if you have won 

**3** If you order a product or services from us, we will need you to input your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit or debit card number and expiry date. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number to be forwarded to the couriers who may deliver your order. These details allow us to process your orders efficiently. 

**4** If you use our “email a friend” service, we ask for the friend's name and email address. We then send an automatic, one-time email inviting your friend to visit us. Details of this transaction are stored only to send that one-time email or to track complaints of mischievous use. Your friend may email [privacy@anm.co.uk](mailto:privacy@anm.co.uk) to ask that it be deleted.

#### Correcting or updating your information

Should your personal information change (e.g. your postcode), or if you no longer want services you have signed up for, email [privacy@anm.co.uk](mailto:privacy@anm.co.uk) requesting that we correct, update or remove the data you provided.

#### More about cookies

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can set your browser to prevent this. If you choose not to accept our cookies, some services on our website may not be as quick or responsive as they might.

#### Your consent

By using this website, you agree that we may collect and use information as described in this policy. We will always make clear how we do this, and allow you to tell us whether and to whom your information may be disclosed. 

To comply with British and European Union laws, we have to make clear that your details may be supplied to third parties, possibly outside the European Economic Area.

Information may also be sent outside the European Economic Area for processing, either by ourselves or by other companies. 

By using this site you consent to both of the above types of transfer.
