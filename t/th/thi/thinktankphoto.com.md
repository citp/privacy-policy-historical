We may use third party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.

**As discussed further below in Section 5, we may collect and store this information in a way that it is linked to you personally, unless you have chosen to opt out.**

#### Website

When you use our website (including our web store), we may collect and analyze information about your computer or mobile device such as your IP address, a mobile device identifier (e.g., a IDFA on Apple products like the iPhone and iPad or similar advertising identifiers), browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services and upload or post content, error logs, and other similar information. We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site, and to improve the content of our website to better match the interests of our website users.

#### Information from Other Sources

Think Tank Photo may receive information about you from third parties, such as commerce partners, marketers, social network services, connected TV and entertainment apps, and other parties that we may use to supplement the information that we collect directly from you. If you connect to a third party network (such as a social network), platform, or service through the Services, you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information (such as name, email address and location) that you agreed the network or other third party platform could provide to Think Tank Photo based on your settings on the third party network or platform. Your agreement collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform, or service via our Services, and/or when you connect with one of our applications through one of these services.

#### Anonymous or De-Identified Data

We may collect data that is already in anonymised or de-identified form or we may manually anonymise and/or de-identify information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information does not identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.

### 3\. Cookies and Similar Technologies

Please see our dedicated [Cookies Policy](https://www.thinktankphoto.com/pages/cookies "Cookies Policy").

### 4\. Online Advertising and Analytics

#### Online Analytics.

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described in the Automatically-Collected Information section above to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to online marketing, as described in the following section.

#### Online Advertising.

We do not serve third party advertisements to you while using thinktankphoto.com. However, we do work with website analytics and advertising partners, including Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest to deliver Think Tank Photo advertisements on third party publisher websites. These partners may set cookies on your computer's web browser. These cookies allow our partners to recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you Think Tank Photo advertisements elsewhere on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement and interactions while using thinktankphoto.com. In this way, ad servers may compile anonymous, de-identified information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw our advertisements, whether or not you interacted with our advertisements, and actions performed on subsequent visits to thinktankphoto.com. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you, and it allows Think Tank Photo to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the usability of our website. In other words, we use analytics data in concert with data about our online ads that have been shown using the Google Display Network, DoubleClick for Advertisers, or other online advertising networks. By doing so, we can understand how anonymous users interacted with our website after seeing our ads.

Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links below in Section 7. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

For more information about these advertising and analytics services and how to opt out, please see the “Your Choices” section below.

### 5\. Uses of Information

Think Tank Photo may use the information it collects for various purposes, including but not limited to:

  * **Service Improvement.** As discussed throughout this Policy, we will use information to understand how users interact with our Services and advertisements, provide tailored content and advertising, improve the overall Think Tank Photo customer and product experience, and perform research and analytics.
  * **Think Tank Photo Personalization Services.** Unless you opt out, we may combine automatically collected information (see Section 2 above) with identifiable information we have collected about you (including your Think Tank Photo device serial number and email address).
