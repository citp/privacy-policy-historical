1\. What information we may collect from you

The information we collect from you will depend on the product or service you apply for, or the service that we provide to you. This will likely include the collection of:

  * your personal details (e.g. name, date of birth)

  * sensitive data* (e.g. medical information)
  * financial information
  * employment information
  * information on how you use our website(s) and products and services



You may not have to provide all the information requested but doing so will help us to ensure we have a fuller understanding about you to allow us to provide services to you.

#### Sensitive Data

*The Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act) defines some personal information as “sensitive data” (physical or mental health, sexual life, criminal proceedings or offences, religious beliefs, race or ethnic origin, political opinions or trade union membership). This information may be necessary to collect, for example, when you apply for an insurance quote. Where we need to collect and process sensitive data about you, by providing this information to us you give your explicit consent for us and any other third party to process this sensitive data as set out in this Privacy Policy.

2\. Joint accounts

If you provide personal information about someone else, for example when a joint application is made, you must do so with the consent of the other person. If you enter into a product jointly with another person, your personal data and any information about the product or service provided to you will be shared with the other person.

The personal information about a joint applicant may be used in the ways as described in this privacy policy.

3\. How and where we collect information

We will collect information from you in various ways, including:

  * when you make an application or enquiry within the Group;
  * information received from a third party, for example when we are required to run checks with a third party, such as a credit reference agency or fraud prevention agency, or where you have previously consented for your information to be shared with us;
  * when you provide information to the Group to help them provide and/or administer any product and/or service that is provided to you by the Group;
  * when you participate in market research, competitions and promotions provided by, or on behalf of the Group;
  * when we may need to obtain up to date information about you to meet our legal and regulatory obligations;
  * where you have provided your consent; or
  * where you use a website controlled by the Group.



4\. How we may use your information

The personal information you provide may be used in a number of ways, for example;

  * responding to your requests, enquires or complaints;
  * to provide our product or services and to notify you of any changes or developments with the products, services or platforms we provide;
  * statistical analysis;
  * profiling purposes;
  * helping us and the other Group companies to understand and develop the Group’s respective businesses, including new and innovative products and services;

  * advising you of promotions, competitions and offers;
  * using information gathered from market research or evaluating the effectiveness of marketing and training;
  * undertaking financial reviews; or
  * where we have your consent.



We will keep your information for as long as we reasonably require it, or where we are required to do so under a legal obligation.

5\. How we may share your information

We may share your personal information with companies or organisations outside of the Group where:

  * we need to do so to provide you with products or services, for example credit reference agencies;
  * we have entered into an arrangement for a third party to provide us with services, for example IT platforms and services, communication services or market research;
  * where we’re required to do so under a legal or regulatory obligation or court order; or
  * where we have your consent to do so.



6\. Safeguarding your personal information

We take the protection of personal data very seriously and we will maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided.

7\. Credit Applications

If you submit a credit card, loan or mortgage application, we may share your information with one or more of the lender(s) whose relevant products we offer (either directly or via a credit broker). We may also make one or more credit searches for each applicant when making our recommendation or selecting a lender. The chosen lender may also search your record to verify your credit worthiness and identity. The credit reference agency will add details of any searches to your record which can be seen by other organisations that make searches and they may use it to help make credit decisions about you, to prevent fraud and money laundering and to trace debtors. Where there is a joint application the outcome of any credit search may be shared with both persons who make an application.

This condensed [guide](https://web.archive.org/pdf/A7965-TM-CAIS-Condensed-Guide-A5.pdf) explains what we will do and how we, the lender and the credit reference and fraud prevention agencies will use your information.

9\. Using fraud prevention agencies

The personal information we have collected from you will be shared with fraud prevention agencies who will use it to prevent fraud and money-laundering and to verify your identity.
