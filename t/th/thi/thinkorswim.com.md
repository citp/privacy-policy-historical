                      WHAT DOES TD AMERITRADE
 FACTS                DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
 Why?                 Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                      consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you
                      how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to
                      understand what we do.
 What?                The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you
                      have with us. This information can include:
                      n     Social Security number and financial account numbers
                      n     Account balances and transaction information
                      n     Income and employment information
 How?                 All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday
                      business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their
                      customers’ personal information; the reasons TD Ameritrade chooses to share; and whether
                      you can limit this sharing.
