## Email 

We may send e-mails to users who have registered with us, and we use this and other information you provide for demographic purposes. We do not give our user list out to other parties and we only e-mail registered users. We do not approve of unsolicited e-mail and do not believe e-mailing users against their wishes is respectable. To that end we keep all e-mails to a minimum, unless a regular update is specifically and explicitly requested by the user. You can remove yourself from all our lists automatically by following instructions. To cancel your forum account, please contact [team@thinkbroadband.com](mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com). We request that any information you provide us is kept up-to-date so that if you fill in any of our surveys, we may contact you to gather more information. 

## Registration 

Our site allows (but does not require) you to register with us if you wish to use some extended features which you may find useful. This also gives members more credibility when communicating on the message boards. Registration only requires one e-mail address, but you may provide an additional address which can be shown to anyone viewing your posts. This ‘public’ e-mail address is optional and your ‘private’ e-mail address is not shown to users other then thinkbroadband staff and volunteers. 

## Cookies 

We use ‘cookies’ to track advertising information, web site usage, and for authentication on the message boards, in addition to allowing you to specify preferences which are stored. 

## IP Addresses 

thinkbroadband collects the IP addresses of users to ensure that the service provided is not abused. We do not ordinarily publish IP addresses of posters but reserve the right to do so in circumstances where we feel it is in the public interest to counter abuse.
