    <h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
<h2>General Policy </h2>
<p>thinkbroadband is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy 
and to using technology to enhance your online security. The 
information that you provide us with, or that is gathered 
automatically helps us to monitor our service and provide you with the 
services that you have subscribed to. We will not release to any third 
party any personally identifying information obtained by us, without 
your prior consent. We will only use the information that we collect 
about you lawfully and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 
(the “Act”). </p>
<h2>Posting personal information to public areas of thinkbroadband</h2>
<p>Please bear in mind that any personal information that you submit 
through forums, letters/emails for publication and the like may be 
collected by others. If you have any concerns, questions or comments 
please email <a href="mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com">

<h2>Email </h2>

<p>We may send e-mails to users who have registered with us, and we 
use this and other information you provide for demographic purposes. 
We do not give our user list out to other parties and we only e-mail 
registered users. We do not approve of unsolicited e-mail and do not 
believe e-mailing users against their wishes is respectable. To that 
end we keep all e-mails to a minimum, unless a regular update is 
specifically and explicitly requested by the user. You can remove 
yourself from all our lists automatically by following instructions. 
To cancel your forum account, please contact
<a href="mailto:team@thinkbroadband.com">team@thinkbroadband.com</a>. We 
request that any information you provide us is kept up-to-date so that 
if you fill in any of our surveys, we may contact you to gather more 
information. </p>
<h2>Registration </h2>
<p>Our site allows (but does not require) you to register with us if 
you wish to use some extended features which you may find useful. This 
also gives members more credibility when communicating on the message 
boards. Registration only requires one e-mail address, but you may 
provide an additional address which can be shown to anyone viewing 
your posts. This ‘public’ e-mail address is optional and your 
‘private’ e-mail address is not shown to users other then thinkbroadband 
staff and volunteers. </p>
<h2>Cookies </h2>
<p>We use ‘cookies’ to track advertising information, web site usage, 
and for authentication on the message boards, in addition to allowing 
you to specify preferences which are stored. </p>
<h2>IP Addresses </h2>
<p>thinkbroadband collects the IP addresses of users to ensure that the 
service provided is not abused. We do not ordinarily publish IP 
addresses of posters but reserve the right to do so in circumstances 
where we feel it is in the public interest to counter abuse. </p>
<h2>Surveys </h2>

<p>On occasion we may conduct online surveys. This is used to gauge 
our service, collect demographic information and other information 
that we may find useful. These surveys are optional. We may share 
non-personal, aggregated information with third parties. </p>
<h2>Security </h2>
<p>The personal information which we hold will be held securely in 
accordance with our internal security policy and the law. While we 
strive to keep the information that you supply directly or indirectly 
secure please be aware that the Internet is not a fully secure medium.
</p>
<h2>Competitions </h2>
<p>From time to time we operate competitions and promotions. 
Participation in these is optional. Be sure to check individual 
competition rules for any conditions that may apply. </p>
<h2>Usage of Information </h2>
<p>We may co-operate with any local or national government or law 
enforcement authorities at their request and provide any information 
we hold. We also reserve the right to provide such information to 
third parties on receipt of appropriate documentation of their 
intention to issue legal proceedings against a user. </p>
