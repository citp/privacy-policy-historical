**WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES.**

Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any information we gather from you on our Website.

We may employ independent contractors, vendors (such as our e-commerce partners) or suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website or products, including but not limited to providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and fulfilling purchase orders.  Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these Outside Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited functions for us. We also require that these contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy [and applicable law], and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted.

In addition, through our Website, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or obtain more information regarding) certain content, products, or services which are sold through a person or company other than us (collectively, “Third-Party Sellers”). Third-Party Sellers may request that you submit certain information to them in order to purchase their products or services or to obtain additional information from them.  By submitting the requested information, you affirmatively consent to have that information shared with the Third-Party Seller.  This information is used by the Third-Party Seller and may be subject to its privacy policy, which may be different from our Privacy Policy.  We do not otherwise share or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information with or to Third-Party Sellers.

We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Foundation provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will notify users of any such transfer through notice on our Website and to the extent possible, through E-mail.

We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our Website, or the general public.

**DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?**

Our Website contains links to third-party websites not owned or operated by the Foundation.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the collection and use of any information gathered by or through any third-party websites, including any sites to which the Website links.  We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, privacy practices and performance of those websites.  We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to third-party websites and read the privacy policies or statements of each and every such website to understand what policies apply to their own collection and use of information.

**IS THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT SECURE?**

We strive to secure transmission of your Personally Identifiable Information from your computer to our servers through commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures.  To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide via the Internet at the time you purchase any product or donate online, the above mentioned third party e-commerce partners, Shopify.com and Strategic Fulfillment Services inc, provide Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) digital security.  Only employees who need access to your Personally Identifiable Information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such Personally Identifiable Information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Foundation will have access to your credit card information provided through this Website.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet.  There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart or bypass our security systems.  As a result, although we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  If you correspond with us by e-mail or a “Contact Us” feature on the Website, a third party could view the information you send in transit by such means.  We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

**CHOICES THAT I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.**

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you.  You may “opt-out” of receiving our e-mail distribution by clicking the unsubscribe link within the e-mail you receive or by contacting our Postmaster at the address set out below.  Please understand that it may take us a few days to process any unsubscribe request.

The information in this section is directed to those users located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”).

To process information of individuals for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we store and process all personal data in the United States and we provide such data to Outside Contractors that are located outside the EEA.  We may do so for the operation of the Website, to provide you with our products or services, for purposes of data analysis or where necessary for exercising, establishing or defending legal rights of the Foundation.

Non-EEA countries might not have the same legal framework for data protection as the EEA countries.  In particular, the United States may not provide a level of protection for personal data, or Personally Identifying Information, equivalent to that of the EEA.

**DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES.**

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” (“DNT”) signals to mobile applications with which the user communicates.  We currently do not change our tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser.  We may have our third-party partners, including web analytics companies, collect information about your online activities over time and across the Website.  These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser.

Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. We are unable to delete information from third-party databases.

In some jurisdictions, including in the countries of the EEA, you have the right, in certain circumstances, to (1) require us to delete your Personally Identifiable Information, (2) require us to restrict processing of your Personally Identifiable Information, (3) receive a copy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and/or instruct us to transmit that data to a third party; and (4) object to our continued processing of your Personally Identifiable Information for direct marketing or other purposes.  If you are resident in the EEA, you can exercise these rights free of charge by contacting our Postmaster at the address set out below.

**CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY.**
