# Privacy Policy - The Frye Company

* We, at Frye, value your privacy. We do not share or sell your information to third parties. TheFryeCompany.com allows you to buy Frye products, enter occasional contests, receive special discounts, fill out surveys, and receive newsletters, e-mails and other promotional information from us. 

We use the information that we collect about you exclusively to fulfill your purchases and to create a more personalized online experience. This policy may change from time to time. All changes will be posted on TheFryeCompany.com as indicated in Section 9 below.

Frye is a division of Jimlar. Only Jimlar will collect, maintain or use your information.

## Information

  * ## Types of Information

In order to better provide you with products and services, TheFryeCompany.com collects two types of information about its visitors: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth and customized experience while using TheFryeCompany.com.

In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.

  * ## Personally Identifiable Information

This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you order a product or service, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit/debit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, we can fill your orders, and better provide you with personalized services.

  * ## Non-Personally Identifiable Information

This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. TheFryeCompany.com gathers certain information about you based upon where you shop on it in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website from which you came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the World Wide Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.

  * ## Product Reviews

If you choose to submit a product review on TheFryeCompany.com, we may ask you for information such as your name and city of residence, which may be used in connection with your review (altogether, the “Review Information”). By submitting the Review Information, you consent to our use, modification, reproduction, transmission, publication and display of such Review Information on TheFryeCompany.com and also in connection with the promotion, marketing and advertising of our products and services; however, we are under no obligation to post any Review Information.

  * ## Information Sharing 

Only Jimlar maintains and may use your information. It is not shared with any other third parties with the exception of third party companies such as credit/debit card processing centers, and shipping carriers employed by Jimlar to perform functions on its behalf including order fulfillment, postal and email delivery, and credit processes. The only information shared is that information which is necessary to process your order. We reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law, and when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.

  * ## Cookies

When you use TheFryeCompany.com, it may store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to TheFryeCompany.com. TheFryeCompany.com cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your first name to welcome you back to TheFryeCompany.com.

## Options

  * ## Security

When you access your account information, the information is kept on a secure server. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access by physical security means.

  * ## Updating PII

You have the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to TheFryeCompany.com. During the online ordering process you can review, change or delete the information that you have submitted. You may change any of your personal information in your account online at any time. We encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases. As a result, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our backed-up databases.

  * ## Promotional E-mails

We may from time to time send you e-mail or other communications regarding current promotions, specials and new additions to TheFryeCompany.com. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters by following the unsubscribe instructions in any e-mail you receive from us, or by sending an e-mail to Frye-Privacy@thefryecompany.com. After doing so, you will not receive future promotional emails unless they open a new account, enter a contest, or sign up to receive newsletters or emails. Please allow up to 2 weeks to process your request.

  * ## Policy Changes

This Privacy Policy was last changed in November 2006. If we make changes to any terms or conditions of the Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted in this document which is always located on TheFryeCompany.com. We may change, modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time, and any changes will become effective immediately upon being posted unless stated otherwise.

  * ## Children's Policy

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000 and imposes certain requirements on websites directed toward children under 13, that collect information on those children, or websites that know they are collecting information on children under the age of 13. We do NOT sell products for purchase by children under 13 through TheFryeCompany.com. Youth-oriented products are sold for purchase by adults only. We will not knowingly or intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Frye is committed to protecting the welfare and privacy of children.
