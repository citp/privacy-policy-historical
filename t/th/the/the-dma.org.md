When you make a purchase we also collect your credit card information, as well as information about your current purchase and we keep information on your purchase history. 

This information is used by us and/or our agents: to support your interaction with our site, to deliver your purchases and to contact you again about other services and products we offer. We may also share your name and geographic address with other reputable companies who have offers we think may interest you. These marketers may in turn contact you.

If you give us your postal address, we will send you periodic mailings with information on new DMA products, services or information on upcoming DMA events. You may also receive business mailings from other reputable companies.

If you supply us with your telephone number, you may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders you have placed, new products and services or information on upcoming events. 

If you do not wish to receive mailings or phone calls from the DMA in the future or if you do not wish us to provide other reputable marketers with your mailing information, please let us know by sending an e-mail to [customer@the-dma.org](mailto:customer@the-dma.org).

**Cookies**

**_All visitors_** – we place cookies on all Web site visitor hard drives to collect aggregate information on the number of visitors to our site and the number of pages viewed.

**_Registered visitors_** – we place unique identifier cookies on the hard drives of those who sign on which are used to maintain the visitor "sign on" status for the duration of the visit, for one-time customizing/tailoring of your visit and for long-term storage of user preferences. We also use cookies to track the pages visited by a visitor so that we can deliver DMA Web content based on the visitor's profile (as provided by the visitor) and the visitor's past activity on the DMA Web site.

**_General information_** – cookie information is used only by The DMA and our agents and is not provided to any other organization. It is used in aggregate for traffic analysis and to provide relevant information to our visitors. It is also used for Web site and system administration, including research and development, user analysis and business decision-making.

For Web site visitors who do not make purchases or otherwise identify themselves…

If you do not sign on to our Web site, our Web server does not have access to personally identifiable information about you. It does not know your e-mail address unless you volunteer it. At the same time, much of The DMA’s communication comes in the form of e-mail, so by not sharing your e-mail address you will have limited access to The DMA’s newsletters and other valuable information.
