<h1>THEHARDFUCKED.COM PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>&nbsp;Protecting the privacy of all of our users is an ongoing commitment of THEHARDFUCKED.COM. This Privacy Policy, which applies to all websites and services provided under the THEHARDFUCKED.COM names and marks, explains how THEHARDFUCKED.COM treats personal information that we collect and receive.
Personal information is information about you, not otherwise publicly available, that personally identifies you; personal information may include your name, location, e-mail address, birth date, or other identifying information. 
</p><p>&nbsp;THEHARDFUCKED.COM has established registration and sign-in procedures which, in conjunction with this Privacy Policy, help ensure the privacy of information provided to THEHARDFUCKED.COM by its visitors and members while using THEHARDFUCKED.COM websites. You should be aware that this Privacy Policy applies only to the THEHARDFUCKED.COM website and services, and not to any other websites you may visit before or after THEHARDFUCKED.COM.
<br></p><p></p><h1>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHO IS COLLECTING IT</h1>
When you register to become a Member of a THEHARDFUCKED.COM website, THEHARDFUCKED.COM collects certain information such as your first and last name, e-mail address, your country of location, and gender, as well as information about each Member's use of THEHARDFUCKED.COM features and contributions of content (collectively, "Membership Information").
