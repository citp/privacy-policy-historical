#### Information related to Advertising

Our Website may contain adverts, sponsored and affiliate links on some pages. These are typically served through our advertising partners. At the moment we are only using Google AdSense. We only use trusted advertising partners who each have high standards of user privacy and security.

These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called "ad networks." Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We may engage with ad networks that are members or organizations or programs that manage the advertising privacy choices these ad networks offer consumers.

However, we do not control the actual adverts seen / displayed by our advertising partners. Our ad partners may collect data and use cookies for ad personalisation and measurement. Where ad preferences are requested as 'non-personalised' cookies may still be used for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting and to combat fraud and abuse. To opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

The Website does not have any control or access over the placement of cookies or other tracking mechanisms that any third party may use or the information any third party may collect. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these ad networks and other parties.

Please note that for EEA users, we have opted for displaying non-personalised Google AdSense ads.
