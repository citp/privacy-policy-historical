We may provide non-personally identifiable visitor information to other parties for marketing, advertising, research, or other uses.  Among other third party providers, we use Google AdSense Advertising and Remarketing on our Website.

**Links to other websites**

We provide links to certain third party websites for your convenience and information. These linked sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we suggest that you review the privacy policy on those websites.

**Cookies and Pixel Tags**

Cookies are small files that a website or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the website's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current Website activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about Website traffic and Website interaction so that we can offer better Website experiences and tools in the future.

"Pixel tags" are tiny graphical images embedded in emails or webpages. Pixel tags are used to determine what parts of a website a visitor has viewed, or whether an email was successfully opened. These technologies do not contain any personal information about you; they are used to gather information to analyze traffic to the Website, to improve our content and navigation, to enhance our marketing efforts, to personalize your experience, and to provide online display advertising tailored to your interests based on your online behavior.

We use cookies and pixel tags to:

  * Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.
  * Understand and save user's preferences for future visits.
  * Compile aggregate data about Website traffic and Website interactions in order to offer better Website experiences and tools in the future.



The Broad also works with third-party marketing partners who use technologies such as cookies and pixel tags on our behalf.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, please note that disabling cookies will cause certain functions of this Website, such as the personalized My Broad section and online purchasing, to cease functioning. We recommend that users enable cookies.

**Do Not Track Signals**

At this time The Broad Website does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include ‘do not track’ instructions. However, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser. You may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies. Blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and prevent you from accessing the My Broad customized experience section, including order history, as well as will prevent you from purchasing or reserving tickets.

**California Online Privacy Protection Act**

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at:[ http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf](http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf)

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

  * Users can visit our Website anonymously
  * Once this Privacy Policy is created, we will add a link to it on our homepage, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our Website.
  * Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
  * Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.
  * Users are able to change their personal information: 
    * By emailing us at [info@thebroad.org](mailto:info@thebroad.org)
    * By logging in to their My Broad account and updating their account settings



**COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)**

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.  The Broad takes special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under thirteen years of age.

**Fair Information Practices**

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.  In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur we will notify the users via email and will provide Website notification within 7 business days.

We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

**CAN-SPAM Act**

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.

We collect your email address in order to:

  * Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
  * Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders
  * We may also send you additional information related to your orders or related content from our Website
  * Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred



To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM we agree to the following:

  * NOT use false or misleading subjects or email addresses
  * Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way
  * Include the physical address of our business or Website headquarters
  * Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
  * Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly
  * Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email



If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from ALL promotional correspondence. You will continue to receive transactional emails about purchases, which is in compliance with CAN-SPAM.

**Amendment of Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time. Such revisions may arise in response to changes in the law, policy, or other factors. Any amendment will be effective immediately upon posting the amended Privacy Policy on the Website. This Privacy Policy was last updated on August 27, 2015. We encourage you to visit this page periodically to review our most current policy. By continuing to access and use the Website, you agree to be bound by the amended Privacy Policy.
