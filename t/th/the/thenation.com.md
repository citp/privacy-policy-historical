However, if your browser does not accept cookies, certain areas of the website may not function properly. Some third-party merchants and advertisers also use cookies.

Opting out of receiving information from third parties will not affect our right to transfer your information to a new owner.
  * If required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process or to protect and defend the rights or property of The Nation Company, L.P. and its affiliates.



## Preserving the Privacy of Your Information

We endeavor to safeguard and protect your personal information. When you submit personal information on our Sites, such information is protected both online and offline. Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors' personal information. The databases are protected in a secure facility and credit card information is transmitted via encrypted technology.

Although we take measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, and we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

_E-mail Addresses:_ Except as may be required by law, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process, we will not share your e-mail address with third parties, although we reserve the right to present you with advertisements on their behalf.

_Subscription Lists:_ In accordance with standard industry practice, we may rent, exchange or sell to third parties mailing address information you provide us when ordering a subscription to our print publication, _The Nation_. We adhere strictly to the Direct Marketing Association's Ethical Business Practices. For information about these practices, visit the Direct Marketing Association's site at [www.dmaresponsibility.org](http://www.dmaresponsibility.org/).

_Agents:_ We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer service. These agents have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but are contractually prohibited from using it for other purposes.

_Third-Party Providers:_ We also make some content, products and services available through cooperative relationships with third parties. For example, from time to time we may collect personally identifiable information from customers on behalf of third parties affiliated with political or other advocacy groups. We may share with third parties any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with such third parties. In some cases, a third party may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of such third party may apply to its use of your information. The privacy policy of third parties may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of a third party, you should contact the third party directly for more information.

_Major Business Transactions:_ In the event of a major business transaction, our customer information may be one of the transferred business assets.
