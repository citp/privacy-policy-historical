### What personally identifiable information does the website collect from me?

Information is collected in several ways. Some personal information is gathered through server log files. Personal information is also gathered when you enter a contest or promotion, subscribe, request vacation delivery stop, or when you place an online ad. During these instances, The Sun Chronicle asks for information such as your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, phone number, subscriber status, and credit card number. We may also ask you for other information at other times.

The Sun Chronicle uses information collected from server log files, such as IP addresses, to help diagnose problems with our services, to administer our Web site, and to report and gather aggregate information about site usage and user demographics. The aggregated data may be shared with advertisers or business partners and is not linked to personally identifiable information.

### Children's Privacy Policy

The newspaper is committed to complying with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. The newspaper does not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in a particular activity. We urge children to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their children restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.

### Information Collected

The newspaper limits its collection of information from children to what is known as nonpersonally identifiable information (e.g. screen names, birthday, gender, city, state, zip code and country of residence). This information is collected so children can participate in activities (e.g. completing polls or online surveys, posting jokes, book reviews, movie reviews, toy reviews, video reviews, concert reviews, game reviews, artwork or questions/comments online, or playing online games) without giving unnecessary personal information. From time to time, however, we may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. child's email address and/or parent's or guardian's email address), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other online activities. The newspaper cannot and does not condition a child's participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. Information is collected actively, such as through registration forms, and passively, such as through cookies.

### Contest and Sweepstakes

The newspaper occasionally offers contest and sweepstakes, which may be entered online. Children under 13 may not participate in any online contest offered by The Sun Chronicle.

### Use of Information

The newspaper may disclose information maintained as required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. The newspaper may also disclose such information in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request.

### Cookies

The newspaper uses a software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information. Although cookies could enable the newspaper to relate a visitor's use of this website to personal information that the visitor has provided, such as an email address, we do not use cookies for this purpose. We do use cookies to determine how many visitors we have and how often they visit various sections of our site. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser.
