PRI secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, an industry standard secure technology.

**How do we protect your information?  **

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit or access your personal information. 

We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Database to be only accessed by those authorized with special access rights to our systems, and who are required to keep the information confidential. 

After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.

**Do we use cookies?  **

Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow this.) Cookies enable a site or service provider system to recognize your browser and capture and retain certain information.

We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements and to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are only permitted to use the information collected on our behalf to help us conduct and improve our business.

We may use cookies to place ads on our site based on your visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.

**Do we disclose any information to outside parties?  **

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
