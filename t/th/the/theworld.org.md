# Privacy policy | PRI's The World

PRI’s The World appreciates your participation in our community, both online and offline, and assures you that your personal privacy is a priority to us. TheWorld.org web site adheres to a strict policy for ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information (such as full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or other identifiable information) and preserving the integrity of your relationship with us online.

**When does The World collect your personal information?**

The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address, and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our site.

When you visit our site, our web server automatically recognizes only your domain name, where you are coming to us from and what browser you are using. We use this information to analyze how traffic flows at theworld.org, but no one can contact or identify you from this information. You may provide personal information to us in several ways: you may share your email address with us when you subscribe to email newsletters or request site updates or when you participate in a campaign or promotion, and you may share personal information when you post comments on our posts or stories. We may ask visitors to provide personal information in other limited circumstances specified at the time the information is gathered.

**Cookies**

The World places an industry-standard “cookie” file on your computer to more accurately count the number of visitors and track activity on our websites. This cookie is totally anonymous and does not store any personal information about individual users. Cookies can also be used to store certain visitor preferences, like your favorite media player or a bulletin board password. In such cases, users have a choice of storing such information in a cookie or typing it each time they visit the site. If you wish to prevent certain or all cookies from being set to your hard drive you may disable them in your browser’s preferences, although your browser might then be unable to accommodate certain functionalities on theworld.org.

**How does The World use your personal information?**

The World will not sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your e-mail address without your permission if you have registered online to one of our sites. This also applies to any information that personally identifies you, except as noted below. We do, however, share information about our audience in aggregate form. For example, we may share with sponsors how long the average reader spends on our site, or which pages or features get the most attention. 

TheWorld.org may use your personal information for the purposes you specifically provided the information. In addition, information gathered on theworld.org is used for responding to visitor e-mails; listing name and location (city, state and/or country) information provided by visitors when publishing e-mails or other submissions; editorial purposes such as surveys (optional); sending communications, including marketing and promotional communications; to enhance existing features or develop new website features, products and services, and to provide sponsors and other third parties with aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information about our visitors and their site usage patterns.

If you send an e-mail, story idea and/or other submission through theworld.org, we may print that submission, or excerpt from it, on theworld.org, read it on air, or publish it in any other medium, together with your name and location (city, state and/or country) if you provide that information to us. 

The World may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process, (b) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of theworld.org site, or (c) protect the personal safety or property of theworld.org Web site users, the public or theworld.org and its employees.

**E-mail Communications:**

TheWorld.org regularly sends email newsletters to our visitors with bulletins and updates about theworld.org stories and features. If you do not wish to receive any email from theworld.org, please visit the e-mail newsletter sign up page to “opt-out.” 

**“E-mail to a friend” feature**

Theworld.org provides an “e-mail a friend about this story” feature, allowing visitors to share an article with a friend that they might be interested in reading. When you use the “e-mail to a friend” feature, we ask for e-mail addresses for the recipient (for delivery) and from the sender (to identify the e-mail sender). Theworld.org does not store or save these addresses and you will not receive e-mail or other communications from us or our partners as a result of having used this feature.

“E-mail a friend about this story” is a mail service that works on an individual basis only. While this tool cannot be used to send mass “spam” mailings, The World cannot exercise control over how site visitors use it, and any e-mail sent through it originates with, and is the responsibility of, the sender, not of The World. 

The World never sells, exchanges or lends to third parties any email or telephone information you provide when subscribing to our E-mail communications.

**Comments/Bulletin Board Participation:**

The World reserves the right to collect the e-mail addresses of those who post comments, messages to our bulletin board, information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations. The information we collect is to ensure compliance with bulletin board rules and occasionally to alert visitors to opt-in to our e-mail newsletter but is never shared with other organizations. Email addresses are never displayed, but they are required to confirm your comments. Names are displayed with all comments. The World reserves the right to edit or delete any comments posted on this site. Please read the theworld.org Comment Guidelines before posting.
