<strong>  TheStuccoCompany.com  Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>At the same time that  TheStuccoCompany.com  is committed to bringing you information
  tailored to your individual needs, we recognize the importance of protecting
  the privacy of personally identifiable information collected about you, our
  customers and prospects. In adopting this customer privacy policy, our intent
  is to balance our legitimate business interests in collecting and using information
  with your reasonable expectations of privacy.</p>
<p>  TheStuccoCompany.com  does not collect personally identifying information about individuals,
  except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals.</p>
<p>Web servers serving  TheStuccoCompany.com  automatically collect information about which
  pages each user visits and the domain name of visitors. This is used for internal
  review, to tailor information to individual visitors and for traffic audits.
  We also provide this information (as well as information from third-party market
  researchers) about our users on an aggregated, anonymous basis to our advertisers.
  Any personally identifiable information provided by subscribers online as part
  of an advertiser promotion online (i.e. online coupons) may be provided directly
  to advertisers.</p>
<p>  TheStuccoCompany.com  may place a "cookie" on the browser of a  TheStuccoCompany.com 
  user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying
  information. A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a
  Web site; we use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes
  such as delivery of ads, so we can customize delivery of information without
  compromising privacy. For example, cookies are used to ensure that you don't
  see the same ad too many times in a single session.</p>
<p>A user's personally identifiable information (e.g., name, e-mail address) may
  be used by  TheStuccoCompany.com  for editorial purposes. For example, we may use information
  provided by you to us as part of an editorial online survey. If we run competitions
  or contests on the site, you may be required to provide information such as
  your telephone number and address in order to participate. The exact rules may
  vary in each case but the specific rules for any contest will state how that
  information may be used. We also may use personally identifiable information
  for marketing and promotional purposes. We may send you e-mails about  TheStuccoCompany.com 
  products, promotions, or services as well as on behalf of other companies.</p>
<p>Additionally, user's personally identifiable information may be used for the
  purpose of establishing an account at  TheStuccoCompany.com  website. Such account is
  required to use full set of functions of our Usenet archive, including posting
  articles. We take all precautions to prevent user's e-mail from being easily
  available to spammers' automated e-mail collection bots. It is required, however,
  that a message that you post be signed, and therefore we transform your e-mail
  into a form that can be deciphered by a human, but is highly unlikely to be
  recognized by a bot. If you choose to post your messages using our Usenet archive,
  please be advised that we cannot guarantee that your e-mail address will not
  be read or used for any purpose by someone outside our system. This is a standard
  way Usenet operates, and our system does not pose any more risk than any other
  newsgroup reader. Also realize that due to the way Usenet operates we do not
  have any control over the message that you posted. Once posted, it cannot be
  deleted or recalled, so choose your words wisely and be polite to the community.</p>
<p>Except as stated in this privacy policy or at the time of collection, user's
  personally identifiable information, will not be transferred to a party outside
   TheStuccoCompany.com , its divisions, its vendors providing Internet hosting services
  or third party list managers unless stated at the time of collection. If you
  do not wish to receive any e-mail or to have us share such information with
  another party, you may "opt out" at any time by e-mailing us or contacting
  us by regular mail.</p>
<p>We do not control the privacy policies of our business partners, advertisers,
  sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks.  TheStuccoCompany.com  users
  should also be aware that, when you voluntarily disclose personal information
  in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others
  and may result in unsolicited messages from others.</p>
<p>Kids: Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information
  about yourself, such as like your name, address, or e-mail address, over the
  Internet, to us or to anyone else and before making any purchases online.</p>
<p>Parents: We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage
  and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. Any personally
  identifiable information collected by  TheStuccoCompany.com  that we are aware is from
  children will be used only for  TheStuccoCompany.com  internal purposes such as market
  research, sweepstakes fulfillment or for fulfilling requests for information
  or materials, and may sometimes be included in our database. Such information
  will not be posted or published by us, or provided to any third parties, without
  your prior consent. Anonymous aggregated data is sometimes provided to other
  parties with which we do business, for statistical and market research purposes
  as described above. Finally you should be aware that if your children voluntarily
  disclose information such as their names or e-mail addresses on various forums
  or chat areas, such disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other
  parties.</p>
<p>Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain
  our flexibility in the online arena. If we need to change our policy in the
  future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect. </p>
