The Zebra may also sell or license Location Based Information regarding its users to third parties, including Service Providers, but not in a manner in which the recipient will be able to identify you personally. You acknowledge that certain information or content that you provide in connection with the Service may inherently allow or help third parties to personally identify you.

In Plain English

We use your personal info to make The Zebra’s services better or more accurate. In some cases, your personal info will be shared with & used to help connect you with our partners.

#### Sharing Of Personal Information

The Zebra may share Personal Information or Location Based Information it collects about you to or with third parties, but only if we believe based upon your actions (including your actions and submissions via our Website) that the third party may have products or services that specifically interest you. Personal Information and Location Based Information collected from you is commonly used to provide you with products and services and to comply with any requirements of law.

Agents or contractors of The Zebra may have access to your Personal Information and Location Based Information on a need-to-know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of The Zebra. All such agents or contractors who have access to such information are asked to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing or as otherwise required by law.

We may also share certain Personal Information or Location Based Information with institutions providing possible product offerings to you based on the information you submit through the Website (e.g. financial institutions and/or insurance companies), and/or certain The Zebra vendors in order to allow them to use that information to obtain and provide us with additional information about you, and/or product offerings that might be of interest to you.

The Zebra or its agents or contractors may disclose Personal Information or Location Based Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of The Zebra or its agents or contractors; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public.

Finally, if The Zebra should ever merge with another organization, file for bankruptcy, or sell our assets, we may transfer the information you provide to us on through the Service to a third party or share your Personal Information to the company with which we enter into such transaction as a part of such transaction.

Notice To California Residents: Subject to certain limits under California Civil Code § 1798.83, California residents may ask us to provide them with (i) a list of certain categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, and (ii) the identity of those third parties. To make this request, California residents may contact us as specified in the How to Contact Us section below.

Our agents might have access to your personal details in order to do their jobs: but they’ll do their best to keep it confidential. While we might share your personal or location info with our partner insurance carriers who we believe you may have interest in receiving product or service offerings from, we take your personal information seriously and will not sell it indiscriminately. We can disclose personal details if the law tells us too, to protect ourselves, or in the interest of public or user safety.

We work hard to keep your info private. However, because the Internet can never be 100 percent secure, you give us your info at your own risk.

If we have a security breach, we may email you (which could be required by law, depending on where you live).

#### Remarketing and Retargeting

The Zebra uses third-party remarketing services (such as Google AdWords, AdRoll, & Facebook) to advertise on third-party websites to previous visitors of TheZebra.com or our properties. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement or posting on the Google search results page, Facebook, or various other websites within these networks or on the worldwide web. Third-party vendors use cookies, advertising identifiers and other technologies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the The Zebra’s properties. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and the privacy policies of these third-party remarketing services. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you by visiting the consumer opt-out page for the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising at <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> and edit or opt-out your Google Display Network ads’ preferences at <http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/>. AdRoll preferences or settings can be adjusted at [http://info.evidon.com/pub_info/573?v=1&nt=1&nw=false](http://info.evidon.com/pub_info/573?v=1&nt=1&nw=false).

Our websites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.

We often use tools for the purpose of remarketing to you on third-party websites. For example, if you visit TheZebra.com, you may begin to notice that The Zebra starts showing up in your Facebook news feed, or in other advertisements throughout the internet. Many of these tools offer you the ability to adjust your advertising preferences or to opt-out altogether.

#### International Transfers

Personal Information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which The Zebra or its affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or contractors maintain facilities, and by using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
