The information we collect automatically is statistical data and does not include personal information, although we may automatically collect your internet protocol (“IP”) address and general geographic information associated with your IP address.. However, we may aggregate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties, and  in those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the aggregated information.

 **NOTICES, DISCLOSURES, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

 **Your California Privacy Rights**

TMC does not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, as defined by California Civil Code Section § 1798.83, unless we give you choice (opt-in or opt-out) before sharing with those third parties. 

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please contact us at [legalnotice@lieserskaff.com](mailto:legalnotices@lieserskaff.com). You must put “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this applies to you. Please note that we will not accept inquiries via the telephone, email, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information. 

**How We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals**

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to online services you visit. California Business and Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how TMC responds to “do not track” browser settings. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, TMC currently does not take action in response to these signals. For more information on “do-not-track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

Please be aware that the data protection laws and regulations applicable to your personal information transferred to the United States may be different from the laws in your country of residence.

 **Children Under the Age of 13**

        The Penny Hoarder is not intended for children under 13 years of age and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 on the Site. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [feedback@thepennyhoarder.com](mailto:feedback@thepennyhoarder.com).

 **Modifications to This Privacy Policy**
