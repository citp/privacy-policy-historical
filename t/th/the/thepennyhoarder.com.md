**YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION**

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you control over your information:

  * **Opt-out from SMS messages.** To stop receiving SMS messages after you’ve signed up for a Campaign, just reply “ **STOP** ” to opt out and cancel the service.  After you send the message “ **STOP** ” to us, we will send you a reply message to confirm that you have been unsubscribed.

**Internet Based  Advertising (IBA)**.  You can exercise your online advertising choices at [http://optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/) and [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) You may also opt out of receiving IBA from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) at the [NAI Service](https://www.networkadvertising.org/), and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ **DAA** ”) at the [DAA consumer choice service](http://www.aboutads.info/).  The tools provided on the [DAA opt-out page](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/) and  [NAI opt-out page](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/) are provided by third parties, and not us. We do not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools. Some of our third-party service providers require us to specifically list their opt-out links, and those links, as well as as opt-out links for other providers we may use, are listed below. When you opt out, you may receive an “opt-out” cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future. You will continue to receive ads, but not behaviorally targeted ads. If you erase your browser’s cookies, you may need to perform this process again. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

**NOTICES, DISCLOSURES, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

**Your California Privacy Rights**

Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents are entitled to request and obtain from us once a calendar year information about the customer information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared customer information for the immediately prior calendar year.

To obtain this information from us, please contact us at [legalnotice@lieserskaff.com](mailto:legalnotices@lieserskaff.com). You must put “Your California Privacy Rights” in the body or in the subject line of your message. We will provide the requested information to you at your email address in response. Please note that we will not accept inquiries via the telephone, email, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information. 

Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the “Shine the Light” requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.

**How We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals**

Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to online services you visit. California Business and Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how we respond to “do not track” browser settings. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals. For more information on “do not track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.
