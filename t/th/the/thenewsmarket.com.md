For the duration of your consent to this policy, we keep your data for as long as is necessary to carry out our services effectively and for as long as we are legally obliged to do so. Following your request to remove your personal data from our system, we will do so within a month of your request being received.

  7. **Who do we share your data with?**



We utilise a number of third party services for the legitimate operation of our business and some of your data will be stored or shared with these services. They include services that help us deliver our website and applications platforms, marketing services that help us ensure we target our communications appropriately and analytic services that help us understand how our services are being used and can be improved.

We provide business services to other businesses. In some cases, we provide their media centre or newsroom sites and functionality. When you use a newsroom site managed by us, you will be asked to consent to that site’s privacy and cookie policies. Any of the data we capture on these sites will be shared with the business we are providing our services.

We only share personal data with others where we are legally permitted to do so. We are a global business and we use third parties located in other countries to help us deliver our services, including countries outside the European Union such as India and the USA. We have taken steps to ensure all personal data is provided with adequate protection and that all transfers of personal data to any location are done lawfully.

We use third parties to support us in providing our services and managing our business. These include providers of information technology, cloud based software as a service, website hosting and management, data analysis, data backup, security and storage services. The technical infrastructure where your personal data is stored is located in secure data centres run by a third party service provider.

  8. **What are cookies and why do we use them?**



A "cookie" is a piece of information (a file) that a web site or app transfers to a user's computer or device, used for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to recognize users who have already registered on one of our sites or apps which can enable a faster and more personalised experience of those sites or apps.

We also use third party cookies. These are cookies that may be read by third parties (for example if you have used social sign-on and have the option to like or comment using your social media account).

Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. To do this look at the “help” menu on your browser. Switching off cookies may restrict your use of the website and/or delay or otherwise affect the way in which it operates. If you wish to restrict only third party cookies (and keep ours), you can do so [**here**](http://www.thenewsmarket.com/global/cookiepolicy/). 

  9. **Where do you store my data and how do you keep it safe?**



We have security measures in place to protect against loss, unauthorized access, misuse, alteration and improper disclosure of the personal information you provide us. These measures include encryption of your personal data according to recommended data protection standards.

Notwithstanding our security measures, you should be aware that when you submit personal information to one of our sites or apps, the information may travel over systems that are not under our control, such as your wi-fi hub and your internet provider’s infrastructure.

  10. **Changes to this policy**



We are committed to adhering to the fundamental principles of data protection and, in Europe, to full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation. We therefore regularly review and update our online privacy policy in order to ensure that it is free of errors and clearly visible on websites, that it contains all the required information and that it is implemented in full.
