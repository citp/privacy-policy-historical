Please note that we only use this information in the aggregate and do not attempt to trace individual readers via IP information.

#### Cookies 

Our site uses cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We do not use cookies for any other purpose. If you choose to decline acceptance of a cookie, there will be no change in the way that content is presented to you. We do hope, however, that you will choose to accept cookies, since serving multiple ads to each user helps this advertiser-supported site remain free to web users.

#### Advertisers 

We use several different orgranizations to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 

#### Registration Forms 

Our site's registration form sometimes requires users to give us contact information (like their name, email, and postal address), and demographic information (like their zip code, or profession). _The Insider Travel Network_ works with a third party that hosts our e-mail newsletters and serves ads into this publication. 

Contact information from the registration forms can be used to ship purchases, mail follow-up information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our readers. The reader's contact information is also used to get in touch with the individual when necessary and to share with other companies who may want to contact our customers. 

Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

Demographic and profile data is also sometimes collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 

#### Surveys 

Our online surveys often ask visitors for contact information (like email address), and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). 

Contact information from the surveys is used to ship purchases or rewards, mail follow-up information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary, and to share with other companies who may want to contact our visitors.

TravelNow collects information from you and makes the appropriate travel arrangements on your behalf.
