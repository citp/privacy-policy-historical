# Privacy Policy - The Mix

## **The Mix  takes your privacy very seriously.**

Under the Data Protection Act 1998, The Mix is the “Data Controller”. In simple terms, this means that we determine what personal information about you is collected and what it will be used for.

In a situation where information is collected, you will be told what is being collected and for what purpose we will use it. We will store it in line with the Data Protection Act 1998 guidelines. We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information with any other parties.

We understand that anonymity is extremely important in some areas of The Mix. We have a general [confidentiality policy](http://www.themix.org.uk/about-us/confidentiality) that applies to all areas where young people interact with us.

## **How and why we collect user data**

By signing up to The Mix you have agreed to allow us to collect your data, such as your name and email address. This information will not be passed onto third parties. Collecting this information about our users will allow us to build a better service and also tailor information/advice to individual user’s situations.

On the occasions where we would like to use your information to communicate with you (for example, as a way to contact you about campaigns or content which we think you may like), we will always ensure users are given the option to sign up for these. You will never be signed up for these automatically. We may occasionally contact you to help improve our current services.

## **Your Voices**

Your Voices allows users to share and upload their stories, photos, videos or playlists to The Mix. Through this service we will collect information from users such as email address, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, work status, location and date of birth.

We collate this information to create a better service for our users and to make sure we can send you relevant advice and information. We will always ensure that users are given the option to sign up for any newsletters we send out. If you submit any content to Your Voices that you want to be removed please contact our [Digital Delivery team](mailto:info@themix.org.uk).

## **Home Truths**

On our Home Truths platform we require users to register and provide basic information such as a valid email address, gender and date of birth. This information will not be passed onto third parties but may be used to tailor information and advice to individual user’s situations.

## **Live Chat**

To register for our Live Chat service users must submit basic information about themselves, including a valid email address and location. This information will not be passed on to any third parties, though we may need it to administer the site and, if necessary, contact a particular user.

## **Polls**

When we run polls on The Mix we use “cookies”. These are small data files that we send to your Internet browser, which are stored on your computer’s hard-drive and subsequently “read back” if you visit The Mix again.  This enables us to recognise you when you return and to know if you have already voted.  The only information stored is your IP address, a numerical label assigned to each computer in a computer network.

You can set your Internet browser to reject cookies. However, if you do some functions of the site may not work properly. In order to do this, please follow the instructions in our [Cookies Policy](http://www.themix.org.uk/about-us/cookies-policy).

## **Discussion boards**

Registration to our discussion boards requires a user to provide certain basic information, including a valid email address. Whilst this information will not be passed on to any third parties, we may need it to enable us to administer the site or contact a particular user.

Cookies are also used in connection with the discussion boards to provide users with a better experience by recognising the user and informing him or her of which postings are new since the previous visit. Cookies can be disabled by following the instructions in our [Cookies Policy.](http://www.themix.org.uk/about-us/cookies-policy)

## **Mailing lists and our newsletters**

You can subscribe to our mailing list by providing a valid email address at the appropriate point. The Mix will only use email addresses to send relevant information, for example about new content and/or promotions. We will not pass your data on to third parties unconnected with The Mix. Users may unsubscribe simply by requesting to do so by email.

## **Surveys**

The Mix may run online surveys from time to time to find out how we can improve our services and to find out our user’s views on topic areas connected with our work – for example drinking or self harm. Users may be asked to provide some basic demographic information, as well as answers to a series of questions.

Occasionally, we may incentivise surveys through the use of a promotion, such as a free prize draw, in which case we may ask for an email address so we can contact the winners.

Survey answers and responses are generally handled in anonymous or aggregate form. Individuals’ specific answers are not disclosed to third parties, however aggregated data may sometimes be passed on in the form of a press release.

## **Competitions**

The Mix may run competitions in which we ask users to supply us with postal address details in case they are chosen as a winner.

## **Google Analytics, Fospha  and Cookies**

The Mix uses Google Analytics and Fospha to gather non-personal information on our visitors. This information helps us understand where our website traffic is coming from, what articles and videos are being viewed and for how long. This is done through cookies and code which is embedded on our websites. For more information please see our [Cookies Policy.](http://www.themix.org.uk/about-us/cookies-policy)

## Subject access requests

Everyone has a legal right to view the information that The Mix holds about them. Requests to see records and other related information are known as **subject access requests**. These should be made in writing to [info@themix.org.uk](mailto:info@themix.org.uk). After making a request you’ll receive a response within 40 days.

The Mix charges £10 per request for administrative fees so please specify carefully all of the information you need to avoid more fees.

When requesting information, you should provide your contact details, along with additional information, for example that you were a volunteer or service user etc.

## **iRights**

We follow the iRights initiative, which envisages a future where the fundamental rights of children and young people to access the internet creatively, knowledgeably and fearlessly is fulfilled. The initiative includes:

  * The right to remove: Every child under 18 has the right to easily edit or delete all content they have created. Under 18s have the right to own content they have created and to have an easily signposted way to retract, correct and dispute online data that refers to them
  * The right to know: Children and young people have the right to know who is profiting from their information, what their information is being used for and whether it is being copied, sold or traded
  * The right to safety and support: Children and young people should be confident that they will be protected from illegal practices and supported if confronted by upsetting scenarios online
  * The right to make informed, conscious choices: children and young people should be empowered to reach into creative places online and also have the capacity and support to easily disengage
  * The right to digital literacy: to access knowledge that the internet can deliver, children need to be taught the skills to use and critique digital technologies
