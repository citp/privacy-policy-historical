**Internet Aspects:**

Personal Information may be collected when a user conducts activities on or related to all websites of Thespread.com (see "Thespread.com Companies Sites") or related to services made available on the Thespread.com Companies Sites. Although information collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under the Thespread.com Privacy Policy do not extend to such information), Thespread.com provides the details below about Internet aspects of Thespread.com services for the purposes of disclosure. 

Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)   
When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP address." For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on.   
Thespread.com may use the user's IP Address to: 

a) Facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user's or SportsDirect Inc's technical team. 

b) Display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on the user's geographic area. 

c) Estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers. 

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to the user's web browser from a web site's computers and is stored on the user's computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user's computer.   
Thespread.com may use cookies to: 

a) Improve the operation and performance of the Thespread.com services and to make Thespread.com services easier and more convenient to use. For example, cookies help Thespread.com provide more personalized services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language preference). Cookies also allow Thespread.com to save passwords and preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter them on the next visit to a Thespread.com website; 

b) Measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to Thespread.com websites and advertisements (e.g. number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps Thespread.com to better understand when to update, change or offer new services and provides Thespread.com with details as to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to SportsDirect Inc's current and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports; 

c) Display advertisements. Thespread.com and Third Party advertising providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Thespread.com websites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are delivered to users (in conjunction with Thespread.com services) by such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising providers on their behalf, and not by Thespread.com; as such, the Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Thespread.com Privacy Policy, and users should consult the privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers, the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user should understand that while Thespread.com do not require a user to use cookies, certain Thespread.com services will not function properly if a user sets his/her browser to not accept cookies. 

**Links To Other Sites And Advertisements**  
A Thespread.com website may contain links to other websites and services. While Thespread.com try to link only to sites and services that share SportsDirect Inc's high standards and respect for privacy, a user should understand that Thespread.com is not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This Thespread.com Privacy Policy applies only to the Thespread.com services related to this Thespread.com Privacy Policy. 

The majority of the advertisements which are displayed in connection with Thespread.com services are served through one or more reputable Third Party advertisement-serving companies which deliver the advertisements to users in conjunction with Thespread.com services. For more information about what information is collected and how information is used by a major Third Party advertising provider click here. 

**Additional Information**  
Thespread.com Companies automatically collect certain information about the user's computer hardware and software. This information may include: browser type, operating system type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by Thespread.com to operate the service, to maintain the quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Thespread.com Companies Sites. 

Certain Thespread.com services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If a user registers for or uses such services, both Thespread.com and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services.
