**Website Visitors**

I use several methods to see how you interact with The Healthy Maven. I do this to improve the website and content for you. In doing so, I track specific visitors who visit my site, track the pages you visit on my site, and the websites you came from. This information is for me to improve and better The Healthy Maven. Statistics may be shared publicly, but personal information on my visitors is never shared.

We collect information from you when you subscribe to a newsletter, fill out a form, enter information on our site, or simply browsing the site.

We may collect personal information from you that you’ve voluntarily submitted to us, such as your name or email address. For example, you may voluntarily submit information to this website when signing up for newsletters or submitting a comment or submitting an inquiry via our contact form.

We may also collect anonymous information such as your IP address. Anonymous information consists of non-personally-identifiable data. For example, when you use our website, we can log your IP address, the device you are using, operating system, browser type, referring website, pages you viewed, time spent on our site, when you came to our site. We may also collect information on actions you take while visiting our website, such as what links or buttons you clicked on.

**Do we use cookies?**

The Healthy Maven may use cookies & tracking technologies depending on the features offered. Cookies & tracking technologies are useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system, tracking the number of visitors to this site, a visitor’s demographics, and understanding how visitors use this site.

Cookies are also to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved user-experience. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

We use cookies to:

  * Keep track of advertisements.
  * Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.

If you turn cookies off, it won’t affect your user-experience.

You may have also subscribed to our newsletter. All newsletters sent may contain tracking pixels. The pixel is embedded in emails and allows an analysis of the success of our marketing campaign. These tracking pixels allow us to see when you opened the email, if you opened the email, and what links you clicked in the email. This also allows the website to adapt future newsletter content to the interest of the user. This behavior is strictly confidential and will not be passed onto third parties.

We do not sell, trade, or transfer any personal information to outside parties. When you correspond with us through email, your email address and the contents of the email is retained. We provide the same protections for these emails as we employ in all information that we have received electronically.

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.

**Third Party Disclosure**

Some of our advertisers may use technology such as cookies when they advertise on our site. The advertiser’s technology can send these advertisers information that may be contained in log files. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing Florida rental houses to someone who has been looking up airfare for Florida, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing home decor ads to someone who frequents home decor sites).

Display Ads: we may use a third-party vendor to serve content and advertisements on our website, which may use cookies, as noted above. The use of cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet.

**Sponsored Posts & Affiliate Programs Disclosure**

In order for me to support my blogging activities, I may receive monetary compensation or other types of remuneration for my endorsement, recommendation, testimonial and/or link to any products or services from this blog.

For your convenience, this website may provide hyperlinks to websites and servers maintained by third parties. Thehealthymaven.com does not control, evaluate, endorse or guarantee content found in such sites. Thehealthymaven.com does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services or content of these sites or the parties that operate them. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use. Your use of these sites is entirely at your own risk.

**Here’s what that all means for you:**

I occasionally post affiliate links. These links may be for various products that I personally use, ebook bundles, and other similar products from bloggers or Amazon.

Know that anything I endorse on this blog, even if it is paired with an affiliate link, I am endorsing because I truly think the product is great, it is one that I use, and I want to pass on the information to you, my readers. I’ll never endorse products that I don’t personally use. I am not paid to write one way or another, and I choose which products I endorse, no one chooses that for me. Buying products through these links allows for me to maintain and grow The Healthy Maven, and I greatly appreciate your support.

Sometimes some pretty great companies reach out to work together and either compensate me for my time or provide me with free material. I will  _never  _endorse a product that I don’t fully stand behind or think would benefit the audience of The Healthy Maven, and I will always share with you when a post is sponsored. All opinions are 100% my own.

The Healthy Maven is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to [ **Amazon.com**](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2FAmazon.com%2F&h=ATMnTKBCQpe5oFbNYFNVlZKeitIxWMuiO0d4zpPYzpL98uw66P6kBSlsmjKI0EP37Bc3wH51Npa8isbuf6wYUmcJtijtoLuaPtUYoU_EhfeUKZC8oOAPz3n6n7yKUJDmkiJ07ZizxB5xPQ) and affiliated sites. As part of this program, I can post customized links, provided by Amazon, to track the referrals to their websites. This program utilizes cookies to track visits for the purposes of assigning commission on these sales.
