      NOTICE: Privacy Policy Effective September 23,2011  
      </h1>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      Targeted Solutions Online and its affiliated companies ("Targeted Solutions Online," "we" or "us") operate the website located at http://www.TheAutoInsuranceScout.com (the "Site"). This notice outlines the privacy policies associated with the Site. By visiting this Site, you are accepting the practices described in the Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy"). The Privacy Policy covers our treatment of Personal Information (as defined below) that we collect when you: (a) visit our Site; and/or (b) request further information about auto insurance plans from Targeted Solutions Online's third party service provider ("Third Party Provider"). It is important that visitors are fully informed about the use of their Personal Information. We believe in 100% permission-based marketing.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>

If you are a resident of the State of California and would like to opt-out from the disclosure of your Personal Information to the Third Party Provider or any other third party for marketing purposes, please e-mail us at: info@targetedsolutionsonline.com. Please be advised that where California residents opt out from permitting their Personal Information to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from us, in accordance with the law.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When you submit Personal Information on this Site, you hereby agree and acknowledge that your Personal Information (as defined below) will be placed into the Targeted Solutions Online database and that such Personal Information shall be shared with third parties for marketing purposes.
</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Your IP Address </h2>
      <p>Each time that you visit the Site, our web server automatically recognizes your IP address and the web page from which you came. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Site, and to better serve you in using the products, services and other features contained within the Site.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Cookies and Action Tags </h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> The first time that a user provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities at the Site, we assign an identification number to that e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the applicable user's PC. Whenever that user comes back to the Site using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to identify the user and to recall the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a user provides other information in connection with their activities to the Site (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), we may store that information, along with the user's e-mail address, in our user database. We may use the information stored in our database: (i) to effectuate the purpose or transaction for which the information was originally provided by a user; (ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event that user wishes to provide personal information in the future; (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Site; and/or (iv) in connection with regular communication with a user, to include offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or are likely to be, of interest to that user. We also use cookies to anonymously track and target the interests of our users to further enhance the experience to the Site. To find out more about cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com. To disable and reject cookies, adjust the settings via the toolbar options menu of your Internet browser.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods:</strong> An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other information to the Site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. We may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of the Site and to provide information about what products/services are viewed or purchased. We reserve the right to retain this cookie and action tag data indefinitely, and to share information generated by these cookies and action tags with advertisers, including the Third Party Provider and our service providers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Personal Information We Collect from You </h2>
      <p>For the purposes of the Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means individually identifiable information from or about an individual including, but not limited to your name, e-mail address, address, phone number, and any other information requested on an application form.  When you respond to offer(s) on the Site, you are asked to submit Personal Information.  The kind of Personal Information that you are asked to submit will depend on the application form.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>How We Use Personal Information </h2>
      <p>By submitting your Personal Information to the Site, you agree that we may share such Personal Information with the Third Party Provider, and that the Third Party Provider may use the Personal Information subject to the terms contained in this Privacy Policy.  Any information that you supply to a Third Party Provider online shall be governed by the terms of its privacy policy. Please be advised that Targeted Solutions Online does not issue auto insurance or any other related products and services. The Third Party Provider will respond to requests for information submitted on this Site, and for determining one's eligibility and other terms for applying for auto insurance.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In addition, Targeted Solutions Online may also sell the Personal Information that you supply to us to third parties for marketing uses, and we may work with other businesses to bring selected opportunities to our users. These businesses and third parties may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of the products and/or services that you registered for on the Site; (b) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (c) e-mail marketers; (d) telemarketers; (e) SMS text-based marketers (where permitted by applicable law); and (e) direct marketers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on our behalf shall have access to our users' Personal Information as needed to perform their functions for us but we do not permit them to use your Personal Information for other purposes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Additionally, we purchase and manage e-mail lists generated by third parties. Users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by utilizing the unsubscribe options that are present and available at the end of each piece of e-mail that we send.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We will also use your Personal Information for customer service, to provide you with information that you may request, to customize your experience on the Site and/or to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions that you enter into on the Site. We may also use your Personal Information for internal business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may also combine the information we have gathered about you with information from other sources. We may use third parties to help us operate our business and the Site or to administer activities on our behalf.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We also reserve the right to release current or past Personal Information in the event that we believe that the user is using, or has used, our products, services and/or Site: (i) in violation of the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy or any other of our operating rules, policies, price schedules and other supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be published by us from time to time; (ii) to commit unlawful acts; (iii) if such information is subpoenaed; (iv) if we are sold or acquired; (v) or when we deem it necessary or appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, and Federal Trade Commission implementing regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute any and all Personal Information with/to any third party for any and all uses permitted by the Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>By submitting Personal Information on this Site, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the "Rule") and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule and the applicable state do-not-call regulations.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In addition, you agree that by submitting your Personal Information at the Site, you agree to receive mobile marketing including, but not limited to, text-message based marketing, from us and our third party advertisers and marketers (where, and to the extent that, such marketing is permitted by applicable law). As such, notwithstanding that your mobile telephone number may be listed on state and/or federal Do-Not-Call registries, we retain the right to contact you via text-message based marketing in accordance with applicable state and federal law. Further, you agree that we reserve the right to share, sell, rent, lease and/or otherwise distribute your mobile telephone and other mobile data with/to any third-party for any and all non-marketing uses permitted by the Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You may unsubscribe from any of our e-mail marketing programs at any time. In every e-mail communication that we send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from the specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided and following the instructions that follow. We attempt to process all unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. However, after unsubscribing, we cannot guarantee that you will never receive another mailing from us, because we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail marketing program that you have opted into. We can guarantee, however, that if you should ever receive another e-mail communication from us, you will be able to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. We are able to offer our free services, in part, based upon the willingness of our users to be contacted by our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers. By allowing us to make the information that you supply available to our marketing partners, you will receive free product and service information that may be of interest to you. You may, at any time, notify us that you do not wish to have your Personal Information disclosed to third parties for offers and promotions by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@targetedsolutionsonline.com">info@targetedsolutionsonline.com</a><a href="mailto:unsubscribe@customerpermissionservices.com"></a>. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>How We Use Demographic Information and Aggregate Data </strong></p>
      <p>We use demographic information to tailor the Site to the interests of our users. Demographic information is shared with third party advertisers so that they can tailor their advertisements to the appropriate audience. Demographic information may also be shared with other third parties. We reserve the right to provide aggregate or group data about our users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage or characteristics of our participants as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information. By providing Personal Information to this Site, you agree to allow us to provide such aggregate data to third parties. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Other Websites </h2>
      <p>This Site may contain links to other third-party owned and/or operated websites. Targeted Solutions Online is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. In some cases, you may be able to make a purchase through one of their third-party websites. In these instances, you may be required to provide certain information, such as a credit card number, to register or complete a transaction at such website. These third-party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and Targeted Solutions Online has no responsibility or liability relating to them.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Our Security Precautions</h2>
      <p>All information collected on this Site is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. If our registration/application process asks users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card and other financial information ("Sensitive Information"), we store and transmit this Sensitive Information using SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect Sensitive Information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. Access to this information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>All of our users' information, not just Personal Information or Sensitive Information, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personal information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all Targeted Solutions Online user information. Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Minors</h2>
      <p>No information should be submitted to, or posted on, the Site by visitors under eighteen (18) years of age.

      <h2>Removal of Your Information/Opting Out</h2>
      <p>At your request, we will remove Personal Information that you have provided to us. You may do so by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto: info@targetedsolutionsonline.com">info@targetedsolutionsonline.com</a>. However, deleting your Personal Information, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of communications from us or third parties, will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of transacting future business to the Site and for managing future communications from us and third parties. These deletions will not change or delete Personal Information already collected as part of a particular transaction in our database, which may have already been shared with third parties, all as provided above in the Privacy Policy. You will need to contact third parties who may contact you directly to change your preferences or your personal information that they may be using to contact you.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
We provide users with the option to opt-out from receiving information sent via electronic mailings on behalf of third party advertisers. Users may unsubscribe from receiving e-mails at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every e-mailing. Unsubscribe requests can only be processed if you have registered with us in the first instance. If you have not registered with us and wish to opt out of receiving e-mails from a particular sender, please consult that sender's opt out policies or contact that sender.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Information sent on behalf of third party advertisers is prepared several days in advance, so users may continue to receive e-mail from us for up to ten (10) days following the unsubscribe procedures detailed above. If, after that point, a user is still receiving e-mail from us, the user should contact us at <a href="mailto: info@targetedsolutionsonline.com">info@targetedsolutionsonline.com</a>. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
