In addition, some sections of our website allow you to provide information directly to third parties whose websites are framed within our website, as described below in the section on “Third party links and co-brand relationships.”

When you visit our website, we may also collect information that does not identify you personally, such as the IP address of the computer making the request, information about your computer and browser, and information about your use of our website.

We use the information we collect to provide you with product promotions, support and any information you request, and otherwise to operate our business and this website.

**How does Trupath® protect visitor information?**

Trupath® uses reasonable security measures to help protect the information that we collect.

**Does Trupath® use “cookies”?**

We use cookies so that we can help provide our customers with a better and more efficient experience on our website. A “cookie” is a piece of information a web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the web site to remember who you are without personally identifying you. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access all of the features on our website.

**Does Trupath® disclose any information it collects from its visitors to third parties?**

Trupath® may share the information you provide to us with third parties to allow these third parties to contact you and provide you offers and other information that they think will be valuable to you. Trupath® does not control the policies or practices of other entities with which we may share data. If you would like to learn about the policies and practices of these third parties or any choices they may offer, you should contact them directly.

Trupath® may share your information with our affiliates or with service providers and vendors who work on our behalf, and these third parties may further disclose the information they receive from us. Trupath® may use, sell or transfer any anonymous or aggregated statistical user data in any manner at any time. We may also disclose your personal information to protect the Company or our legal rights or when required to do so by law, including in response to a search warrant, subpoena, court order, or request from a law enforcement agency. We may transfer information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, partial or total sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.

We serve some third-party ads when you visit our Website.

Trupath uses one or more companies to place advertisements for our products and services and those of third parties on our Site and third-party sites. Cookies and other technologies such as Web beacons or tags are used to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to determine the display of content and advertising to you based on your interests both on our site, as well as on third-party sites where you may visit. To support this interest based advertising solution, we, and companies who we have contracted with, may use anonymous information about your visits to our and other Web sites. The information collected and used by this process is always anonymous, and does not enable any third-party to identify you individually.

Although it is our hope that you find the display of advertising to you based on your anonymous interests valuable, if you would prefer not to participate in the services offered through these solutions, you can always opt-out of this activity by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website by [clicking here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

**What are my choices?**

**Third party links and co-brand relationships**

In order to provide increased value to our visitors, Trupath® may choose various third party websites to link to and from, and frame within, its own website. Trupath® may also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer information, programs and other services and features to its users. A “framed” website is a page from a third party’s website that appears within our website. Framing allows you to interact with a third party website without navigating away from our website.

These third party web sites may independently solicit and collect information from you. Trupath® does not control these linked sites. Since their treatment of personal information may differ from ours, we encourage you to carefully review the privacy statements and terms of use of all third party web sites you access. On occasion, those third party web sites may provide us with information about your use of those sites.
