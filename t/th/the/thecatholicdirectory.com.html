			viewable by others as confidential and private, except as required by law, including without limitation,
			the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C. Sections 2701-2711 (the "ECPA"). The
			ECPA permits this site's limited ability to intercept and/or disclose electronic messages, for example (i)
			as necessary to operate our system or to protect our rights or property, (ii) upon legal demand (court
			orders, warrants, subpoenas), or (iii) where we receive information inadvertently which appears to
			pertain to the commission of a crime. This site is not considered a "secure communications medium"
			under the ECPA.

			for purposes of the mailing; we do the mailing for them. However, if you do click on any of the links
			to their websites or accept any of these promotional offers, your click-through information and any
			information that you provide in the process of registration or purchase will be transferred to these sites.
			We have no responsibility or liability for the policies and practices of these sites. You should be careful
