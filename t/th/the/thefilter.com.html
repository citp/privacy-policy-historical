This privacy policy covers the
collection and use of personal information that Exabre Limited, the owner of
The Filter, may collect and interact with The Filter, such as when you visit
our website or when you call our support associates.</p>

<p>Please take a moment to read the
following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of
information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to
whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal
information. Your privacy is a priority at Exabre, and we go to great lengths
to protect it.</p>

<h4 style="mso-line-height-alt:10.5pt;background:white">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Verdana">Why we collect personal information</span>
</h4>
<p>Why do we collect your personal
information? We do this for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Because your personal
information is necessary for us to deliver a superior level of product
functionality and customer service. The Filter product thrives off the ability
to collect, analyze, compare and recommend the best music tracks and artists
for you. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and
services.</li>
<li>In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted on
the latest product announcements, and software updates that you might like to
hear about.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Your personal information, such as
username/password, email address and music collection data are all we need on
an ongoing basis to provide you with our The Filter product and services.</p>

<h4 style="mso-line-height-alt:10.5pt;background:white">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Verdana">What information we collect</span>
</h4>

<p>There are a number of situations
in which your personal information may help us give you better service. For
example, we may ask for your personal information when you’re discussing a
service issue on the phone with an associate, downloading a software update, or
registering your product. At such times, we may collect personal information
relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number,
email address, and contact preferences, information about The Filter product
you own, such as the version, and date of download; and information relating to
a support or service issue.</p>

<p>We also collect information
regarding customer activities on our website and on related websites. This
helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and
to understand which parts of our websites and Internet services are of most
interest to them.</p>

<p>The Filter allows you to create a Filter
ID based on your personal information. This convenient registration process
saves you time and allows for easier use of our web services.</p>

<h4 style="mso-line-height-alt:10.5pt;background:white">
<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Verdana">Here's how it works:</span>
</h4>

<p>You create a personal profile providing your password and email address. The
system saves your information and assigns you a personal Filter ID.</p>

<p>This unique Filter ID is all we
need to recognize you on our Music Community Server and enable us to analyze
your music collection, safe store and anonymously share your playlists and
provide you with the full functionality of The Filter. Your Filter ID does not
store any other personal details.</p>

<h4 style="mso-line-height-alt:10.5pt;background:white"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Verdana">When we disclose your information</span></h4>

<p>Exabre takes your privacy very
seriously. Be assured that Exabre does not sell or rent your contact
information to other marketers. To help us provide superior service, your
personal information may be shared with legal entities within the Exabre group
globally who will safeguard it in accordance with Exabre’s privacy policy.
There are also times when it may be advantageous for Exabre to make certain
personal information about you available to companies that Exabre has a
strategic relationship with or that perform work for Exabre to provide products
and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process
information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you,
manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service or assess your
interest in our products and services. These companies are also obligated to
protect your personal information in accordance with Exabre’s policies. Without
such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to have
products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to
improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and
content on The Filter website.</p>

<p>At times we may be required by law
or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information
about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other
issues of public importance, disclosure is absolutely necessary.</p>

<h4 style="mso-line-height-alt:10.5pt;background:white"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Verdana">How we protect your personal information</span></h4>

<p>Exabre takes precautions including
administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard your personal
information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as un-authorized access,
disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>

<p>You can help us by also taking
precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change
your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure
you use a secure web browser.</p>

<h4 style="mso-line-height-alt:10.5pt;background:white"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Verdana">Integrity of your personal information</span></h4>

<p>Exabre has safeguards in place to
keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date for the
purposes for which it is used. Naturally, you always have the right to access
and correct the personal information you have provided. You can request a copy
of your personal information, your product registration history, and your
interactions with The Filter by contacting us at the email address below.</p>

<h4 style="mso-line-height-alt:10.5pt;background:white"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Verdana">Cookies and other technologies</span></h4>

<p>As is standard practice on many
corporate websites, The Filter’s website may use 'cookies' and other
technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most
popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We
may also use cookies and other technologies to make sure that any online
advertising is bringing customers to our products, such as The Filter. We may also
use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website, to
make it even more rewarding as well as to study the effectiveness of our
customer communications. Finally, we use cookies to customize your experience
and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us.</p>

<p>As is true of most Web sites, we
gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This
information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
stamp, and clickstream data.</p>

<p>We use this information, which
does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site,
to track users movements around the site and to gather demographic information
about our user base as a whole. Exabre will not use the information collected
to market directly to that person.</p>

<p>In some of our email messages we
use a click-through URL linked to content on The Filter website. When a
customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before
arriving at the destination web page. We track this click-through data to help
us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our
customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking
text or graphic links in the email.</p>

<h4 style="mso-line-height-alt:10.5pt;background:white"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Verdana">Our commitment to your privacy</span></h4>

<p>Exabre takes protecting your
privacy very seriously. To make sure your personal information is secure, we
communicate these guidelines to our employees and strictly enforce privacy
safeguards within the company.</p>

<p>The Filter’s website has links to
the sites of other companies. Exabre is not responsible for their privacy
practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those
companies.</p>

<h4 style="mso-line-height-alt:10.5pt;background:white"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Verdana">Privacy questions</span></h4>

<p>If you have questions or concerns
about Exabre’s Customer Privacy Policy or data processing, please use the email
address to contact us. The Filter Administrator will respond to your inquiry
within 20 days.</p>

<p>Exabre may update its privacy
policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way a notice
will be posted on our website along with the updated privacy policy.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns
about Exabre’s collection, use, or disclosure of your personal information,
please email us at <a href="mailto:support@thefilter.com">support@thefilter.com</a></p>
