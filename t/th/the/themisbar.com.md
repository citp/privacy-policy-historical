### Effective

This Privacy Policy was last modified on February 2, 2009. 

### Information Practices

Themis Bar Review, LLC ("Themis") understands that security and privacy are important issues for visitors to the ThemisBar.com website (the "Site") and recognizes its obligations to keep your information secure and confidential. We maintain the standards set forth in this Privacy Policy to help protect information that personally identifies you. By using the Site, you agree to comply with and be bound by all terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, which we also urge you to read. If you do not agree to these terms, you are prohibited from using the Site. 

### Collection of Information

You may be asked to voluntarily provide your name, billing address, law school, telephone number, email address, credit card number or other personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") to make purchases or to have access to some features of the Site. By using the Site and providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to our use of such information as described in this Privacy Policy. You may always refuse to provide your Personal Information, but this may lead to our inability to provide you with certain products or services. 

Themis or its business partners may also collect information that is anonymous, such as the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (for example, "aol.com"); the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of the computer you are using (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider); the browser software you use and your operating system; and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to this Site (collectively, "Anonymous Information"), through the use of cookies or by other means. We hope that, by using Anonymous Information, we can update the Site to make it more useful to you and other users. We reserve the right to maintain, update, disclose or otherwise use Anonymous Information, without limitation. 

### Use of Information

Themis uses your Personal Information for the following purposes: to process your orders and administer your account; to administer and improve the Site and related services; to notify you of our products, services, promotional events or special offers that may be of interest to you; to provide Internet security; and to meet legal requirements. We may work with our business partners who may perform certain functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling orders, sending email messages related to your purchases or inquiries, managing data, processing credit card payments or providing customer service. These business partners have access to your Personal Information only to the extent necessary to perform these specific functions and may not use it for any other purpose. 

Other than for the specific purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your Personal Information unless we obtain your prior consent or are legally required to do so. We may use third party advertising companies to place ads on the Site and to place our ads on other websites. These companies may use Anonymous Information about your visits to this and other websites to provide advertisements on the Site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If Themis is involved in the sale of a substantial portion of its business assets, Anonymous or Personal Information may be among the transferred assets. 

### Legal Disclosure

Themis may disclose your Personal Information or otherwise use such information if required or permitted to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process or any governmental request; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Themis or its business partners; (3) enforce the Terms of Use or any applicable agreements; or (4) protect the personal safety or interests of Themis employees, users of the Site or members of the public in urgent circumstances. Themis may also disclose your Personal Information to a third party that alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights, subject to reasonable verification of such claims. 

### Forums

Themis may provide forums to users of the Site. Any information that is disclosed in the forums is public information and users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose Personal Information. If you voluntarily disclose Personal Information in a public area of the Site, such as a forum, that information may be collected and used by a third party to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements or for other purposes. Themis does not control the actions of these third parties in forums and other public areas of the Site. If you disclose Personal Information in a public area, you do so at your own risk. Further, any communications within the Site and forums travel through Themis' servers and any such communications that you send or receive may be monitored by Themis.
