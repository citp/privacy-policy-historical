Privacy Policy Data privacy

Information we collect may include personal data related to individuals such as name, phone and e-mail address. We treat all this information as confidential. We do not sell it to a third party, except hand it over as required by law or as necessary for us to provide you with the required services. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify this policy at any time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will post a notification on this site.

Sharing your data

Because The Paypers sometimes operates with partners, we may occasionally use our contact base as a channel for those partners. Your data will not be transferred to them in such cases. We assure that we will not do so for content that is not within the scope of our professional activities. Moreover, if you receive such information, The Paypers will always ensure an opt-out possibility for further notifications.

Identification data

When you voluntarily supply us with your personal information such as your name, phone number and/or e-mail address or other contact information, we may use it to correspond with you. In the future, we may also (re)use it to start a subscription upon your request, or to register you for a particular service or event.

Browsing

If you browse The Paypers website, you do so anonymously. We may use your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to administer our website and to collect and distribute aggregate statistics about our visitors such as traffic patterns and related site information.
