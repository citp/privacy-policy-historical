      and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use
      Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street

      <b>
      </b><p><b><font face="Arial">How we gather information from users</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">How we collect and store information depends on the
      page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate
      and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide
      information when you register for access to certain portions of our site
      or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a
      purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes
      and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas
      of our site. Like most Web sites, TheAmazingWidget.com also collects
      information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may
      be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your
      Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and
      hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store
      your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that
      information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you
      encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt
      additional technology, we may also gather information through other means.
      In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for
      example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do
      you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked
      to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to
      customize the site’s features according to your preferences.</font></p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b><font face="Arial">What we do with the information we collect</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to
      enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and
      advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information
      with anyone.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Aggregated Information (information that does not
      personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may
      combine information about your usage patterns with similar information
      obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to
      learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).
      Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and
      business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally
      Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you
      individually.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">We may use Personally Identifiable Information
      collected on TheAmazingWidget.com to communicate with you about your
      registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and
      privacy policy; services and products offered by TheAmazingWidget.com and
      other topics we think you might find of interest. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Personally Identifiable Information collected by
      TheAmazingWidget.com may also be used for other purposes, including but
      not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of
      e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and
      other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical
      support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for
      example) may access such information. We will use your information only as
      permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop
      our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or
      businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the
      transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a
      court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to
      do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to
      us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate
      or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to
      disclosure in such cases.</font></p>
