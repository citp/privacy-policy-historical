We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## **Information We Collect**

### **Information You May Choose to Provide to Us**

We may collect information, including personally identifiable information, directly from you if you choose to provide that information. For example, you may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email address), date of birth, or other details of that nature, when you sign up for our newsletters or participate in promotions or surveys on the Site.

You also may choose to provide personally identifiable information about yourself when you participate in discussions on the Site. Please be aware that information you post in these discussions/comments may be viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Site, therefore you should avoid posting sensitive personal information that you would not want to be available to the public.

You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and email address, when you register with the Service. Also, you may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, poll and surveys, message boards and comments, email messages and newsletters and other interactive areas of our Website (all such information and material, “User Content”). When you register we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, zip code and other information on you and your personal interests.

We use information that is collected for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see (such as banner advertising), facilitate product and content development, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

Therefore, some features of the Service may not function properly or at all if the ability to accept all cookies is disabled. Other cookies and tracking tools collect information about your browsing habits in order to help us and advertisers make suggestions relevant to you and your interests.

These tracking tools will collect information on what parts of our websites interest you – in other words, your behavior or browsing history. We also work with outside partners who help us gather this information. These partners help us both on our websites as well as outside websites. You can opt-out of having us collect and share this information by following our opt-out methods below. **Please note that the choices you make are browser-specific.
