**3\. What is our lawful basis for using your Personal Information?**

3.1           We will only use your Personal Information when we have a valid reason (also known as a ‘lawful basis’) to do so. Which legal basis is applicable will depend on precisely how we are using your Personal Information and for what purpose.

3.2           Most commonly, we will use your Personal Information:

  1. a) because it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests and where there is no undue adverse impact on you;
  2. b) in order to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
  3. c) because you have consented to us doing so



3.3           Where we are processing your Personal Information for the purposes of pursuing our legitimate interests, those interests may include:

(a)            responding to any queries you may have, providing you with information you request and/or to help us operate and improve the GBBO Sites;

(b)            the development, production, exhibition, exploitation, distribution, advertising, publicity and promotion of the Programme and your contribution to the Programme;

4.2          Should a third party acquire all or a substantial portion of our business (whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets, or as part of any insolvency where such a transaction has been approved by the court) we may include your Personal Information then in our possession as part of the transferred business assets in such sale/ transfer and share the same with our advisors and any prospective purchasers and their advisors.

4.3           Where we transfer your Personal Information outside the EEA we will ensure that it is protected and transferred in a manner consistent with legal requirements applicable to the Personal Information concerned. This can be done in a number of different ways, for example: the country to which we send the Personal Information may have been assessed by the European Commission as providing an “adequate” level of protection for personal data; the recipient may have signed a contract based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission; where the recipient is located in the US, it may be a certified member of the EU-US Privacy Shield scheme. In other circumstances, the law may permit us to otherwise transfer your Personal Information outside the EEA. In all cases, however, any transfer of your Personal Information will be compliant with applicable data protection law.
