When you sign up for the <b>Paperboy Affiliate Program</b> we collect your name, email address and site URL. This allows us to review your site for inclusion in the program, send out your HTML code and let you know about any news specifically relating to the affiliate program. Your email address will never be provided to a third party and will not be used by us except to inform you of news specifically associated with your participation in the affiliate program.

When you send a <b>"Letter to the Editor"</b> we collect your name, address, country, and phone number. We also keep a record of the date your message was sent and which paper it was sent to. We do not retain the body of your message and at no time do we or any third party see what you wrote. We use the information collected in order to track and block users who are found to be abusing the system - we do dont want our mail server to be used as an anonymous means of sending abusive letters etc. We may also use information to compile anonymous demographic data on our user base in order to better tailor the site to suit the needs of users.
<br><br>
When you send us a message to tell us about <b>broken links, to add a paper or just to send feedback</b> we retain you email address in order to provide a response.

<b>The Paperboy does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.</b> We may use certain information about our users (country of origin, zip code etc) to compile <b>anonymous demographic data</b>. This data may be shared with trusted third party advertisers in order for them to target particular areas of the Paperboy site. Non-anonymous data (your name, email address, phone number etc) will never be divulged to any third party and you will never be contacted by a third party as a consequence of information provided to us.
