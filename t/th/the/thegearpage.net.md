Your privacy is important to The Gear Page, and its owner, The Gear Page, LLC. If you choose to register with The Gear Page in order to become a member, the information stored on our website is limited to the information that you supply when registering. In certain situations we may request more information from you.

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web site to help us provide better service. For example, we may keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on The Gear Page, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data”. The Gear Page, LLC may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better service. 

We collect the information mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web site functions may not work properly. 

Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. If we believe that you have broken our rules, we reserve the right to look at any potentially relevant content including, but not limited to, private messages in our system, IP addresses and any other information that may assist us in determining if rules were broken.

We have 3rd party vendors, such as Google, that use cookies to serve ads that are based on users prior visits to TGP. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting [Google's Ads Settings](http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/) or you can opt out of certain third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/)
