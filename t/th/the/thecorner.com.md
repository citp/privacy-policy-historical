Your personal data is stored in a way which allows YOOX USA to identify you for the period that is strictly necessary for the original purposes for which such personal data is collected and subsequently processed, all in accordance with applicable laws.   
Please report any changes to your personal data to [**privacy@thecorner.com**](mailto:privacy@thecorner.com) in order to ensure that your personal data is always accurate and kept up-to-date.   
Your personal data will not be disclosed to third parties for purposes not permitted by law or without your explicit consent.   
Your personal data may only be disclosed to third parties when it is necessary to process an order placed by you. For example, your personal data is disclosed to Paymentech Inc. for the performance of electronic payment services, through credit/debit cards. Moreover, your personal data may be disclosed to the police or to judicial authorities, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and upon a formal request by such authorities for the purposes of preventing a fraud against us (anti-fraud services). Data processors will also have access to your personal data, as stated in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy, for the specific purposes stated in that Section. In all the above circumstances, your consent for data processing will not be specifically requested.
