# Privacy Policy - The High Tech Society

**Privacy Policy**

At The High Tech Society we not only respect your privacy concerns, but we also understand the issues behind them. We live in a world where information is a currency, and your private data might be sold by unscrupulous web-site owners looking to make a buck. In fact, most of our writers and admins have been a victim of this sort of data transfer at one point or another. That’s one of the reasons why we respect your privacy. Not only do we promise not to share or sell your private or anonymous information with anyone in any capacity other than site analytics, or the purpose for which you have given it, but we also promise to protect your information using the highest standards of web security. The following privacy policy applies to The High Tech Society and it’s sub-domains, newsletters, social pages, and other content.
