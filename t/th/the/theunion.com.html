						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">We do not sell, trade, share or rent your personal information to non-affiliated parties. Furthermore, we will not disclose any personal information about you unless we have a good reason to believe that it is necessary to (1) comply with legal statutes, (2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (3) protect the rights, property or safety of TheUnion.com or our individual or business partners.</font></p>
						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">Sometimes, we may provide aggregated statistics about you regarding sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include any personal identifying information.</font></p>

						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">TheUnion.com encourages its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect your privacy. Be aware, however, that our business associates who are accessible through our site may have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. You should review the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personal information through co-branded, affiliated or linked sites.</font></p>
						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">In some cases, we may be providing a service or promotion to you in affiliation with another company. In some of those instances, we may be obliged to share your information with our partner company to facilitate the co-branded service or promotion.</font></p>
						<p><b><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">Modifying or Removing Your Information</font></b></p>
						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">We may use personal information to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences, our Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy and other services we offer. If you prefer that we do not use your information to send you such information, you may decline during the registration process. You may also request that we remove your or your family’s information from our files at any later time by sending an E-mail note to tomh@theunion.com or sending a letter.</font></p>
						<p><b><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">Unauthorized Data Collection</font></b></p>
						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">You should also be aware that you may voluntarily or inadvertently disclose personal information (e.g. user name, email address or other identifiers) on message boards or in chat sessions of TheUnion.com. That information can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from others. Such activities are beyond our control.</font></p>
						<p><b><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">Cookies, the Technology</font></b></p>
						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">Cookies are broadly used today and TheUnion.com may incorporate them. Cookies may contain personal information; but it’s important to note that they contain only as much information as you disclose to the site that sent them to you. Cookies enable a Web site to serve you more quickly and conveniently and to provide you with information that most interests you.</font></p>
						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">Cookies are small packets of information that may be transferred from a Web site computer that you visit and your browser may optionally store the information on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie may be retrieved by a webserver on subsequent visits to a Web site</font></p>
						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some portions of TheUnion.com will not be able to provide you with all available services if you do so.</font></p>
						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">You also may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. We cannot control those cookies and they are outside the scope of this Policy. Please refer to the privacy policies of sites that you link to for additional information.</font></p>

						<p><font face="helvetica,arial,geneva">As stated above, online visitors of any age may voluntarily or unwittingly divulge personal information that may result in disclosure of personal information or e-mail IDs.
