## **2\. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES UBISOFT COLLECT?**

## **2.1 When you use Ubisoft services**

**2.1.1 While Browsing Ubisoft websites**

**Cookies.**  Ubisoft uses cookies on the Services. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that web sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies are not intended to include people's names, or other information that is directly identifiable; rather, they are typically used to quickly identify a user's device and to "remember" things about the user's visit. Ubisoft may set cookies for your web browser as you visit our websites, use our products, or visit a website where Ubisoft provides ads, content or analytics. For example, Ubisoft uses cookies to keep track of selected items in your shopping cart on our online store, and to remember your Account identifier. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to shop online or to access certain features of our Services. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" resources for your web browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. In addition to Ubisoft using cookies on our network of websites, Ubisoft may allow certain partners to set and access their cookies on your computer. These companies’ use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Ubisoft Privacy Policy. Please review them carefully. For more information about cookies, please see [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Standing alone, this information is not personal data; however, if Ubisoft combines any of this information with personal data, Ubisoft will treat this information as personal data pursuant to this Privacy Policy.

Ubisoft may work with trusted marketing partners to bring you more useful and interesting advertising content on our Services and on third party sites and services. If the box labeled "Share my information with select parties" box on your Ubisoft Account settings is checked, we may do this by sharing or matching the personal information you have provided us on the Services with the information (which may include personal information) you have provided third party marketing partners. If you do not want Ubisoft to match your Personal Information with trusted partners to tailor ads or other custom content for you on our Services and/or third party sites, you can uncheck this box at <https://account.ubisoft.com/> at any time.

By default, certain aspects of the Public Profile are set to "public". Those aspects of the Public Profile that are designated as "public" will be visible to everyone, potentially including people not registered within the Ubisoft environment, and may be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for you. If you post your personal information to a Public Profile, including a video, image or photo, you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent.

We are not responsible for disclosure by other users of your Personal Information, including without limitation, videos, images or photos that you choose to make public on the Ubisoft Services. Also, please remember that the Personal Information you provide to us as part of your Public Profile may reveal or allow others to identify aspects of your life that you may not choose to state on your Public Profile directly (for example, your picture may reveal your gender). Certain Services may feature a friend finder tool. By using our friend finder tools, you acknowledge that these tools will help you find your contacts, and will also allow your contacts to associate your Ubisoft Account, other Ubisoft accounts (if any), and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and console platforms with your social networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting friends' list, which may be accessible across Ubisoft’s sites, will be subject to this Privacy Policy. Note that the friends that you choose to include on your friend list may be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different Ubisoft products and Services, and may see the profiles and information you have made visible to them or to everyone. Similarly, Ubisoft may also collect or receive information about you from other Ubisoft users who choose to upload their emails and other contacts. This information will be stored by us and used primarily to help you and your friends connect.

## **7\. MINORS**

Unless stated specifically to the contrary in a given Service, our Services are not intended for children, and Ubisoft will not request any Personal Information from children. For games that are not directed at children but nonetheless likely to appeal to younger players, we take additional steps to limit access to these Services on age grounds, and limit data collection for underage players to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of the Service.

In certain jurisdictions, for we may allow a child to register for specific Services with parental approval. In these circumstances, we will take additional steps to protect the child’s privacy, by notifying the parent about our information practices with regard to children, and asking for consent before processing their child’s personal information. Parents may delete their child's account, change their child's privacy settings, or access and modify their child’s personal data at any time by contacting customer support at support.ubi.com.

In all cases, use of the Services by Children must take place under the responsibility of their parents or legal guardians and any use of the Services is assumed to have been validated by them.
