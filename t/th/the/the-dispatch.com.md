### Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research

The Dispatch | Lexington, NC may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Web sites, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.

### Mobile Messaging Service

We may elect to offer certain text messaging services (the “SMS Service”). We use the information collected from your interaction with the SMS Service solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed, except as required by law.

Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage: their practices are governed by their own privacy policies. 

The Dispatch | Lexington, NC collects the mobile phone number you use to send us a text message and the content of the messages sent between you and The Dispatch | Lexington, NC.

### Cookies and Other Technologies

As is standard practice on many Web sites, The Dispatch | Lexington, NC uses “cookies” and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our Web sites are the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. Users who do not accept cookies from the domain "The-Dispatch.com" cannot access most areas of our sites.

We reserve the right to place a The Dispatch | Lexington, NC Company cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular Web page.

Yahoo! is an ad network partner that displays ads on NYTRMG sites. To improve your ad experience on NYTRMG sites and elsewhere on the Internet, we may send non-personal information to Yahoo! based on your browser's activities, such as type of pages viewed and categories of interests, so that the advertising you see is relevant to you.

NYTRMG, of which we are a part, is currently using Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to administer our Web site and constantly improve its quality. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of The-Dispatch.com is owned and used by The Dispatch | Lexington, NC or NYTRMG.

### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Advertisers on The-Dispatch.com may elect to use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our Web site, and in these instances may use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags/pixel tags) to better manage advertising on our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about the online movements of Web users. For instance, advertisers may place a clear gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Please keep in mind, we do not have access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor additional information they may be tied to by the advertiser.
