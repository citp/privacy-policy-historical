### What Information Does Argyle Collect?

You provide us with information about yourself, your firm or company, and your practices when you visit the web site, register for certain services and events, download whitepapers, subscribe to our publications, or register for email newsletters and alerts. This information includes your name, company name, job title, phone number, mailing address, and email address. You may also provide additional comments on how you see Argyle servicing your needs and interests. 

If you choose to correspond with us through email, Argyle may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses.

We may obtain additional personal and other information about you from third parties, and combine it with the information that we collect from you. These third parties may include publicly available sources such as LinkedIn.

The web site may utilize a standard technology called “cookies” and web server logs to collect information about how our web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our web site, and the web sites visited just before and just after our web site. Argyle may also use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to determine the same information.

A cookie is a very small text document, which includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a web site, that web site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other web sites.

As you login on our web site, the web site uses its cookies to differentiate you from other users so your data is only available to you. In some cases, we also use cookies to prevent you from logging in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with our web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our web site and which parts of the web site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our web site and better serve our customers. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not generally store any personal information that you provided to us in your cookies.

### How Does Argyle Use the Information That You Provide to Us?

_Lawful Basis for Processing_

On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide services to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning our products and services.

On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.

Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for our direct marketing purposes and this interest is not overridden by our data protection rights. Where we process your personal data for these purposes, our legitimate interest is to carry out our activities in furtherance of the well-being of all our employees and members and to provide our event attendees with information regarding products similar to those in which they’ve expressed interest or participated in the past.

If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we will ask you for consent to process your personal data. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.

If you wish to exercise the right to withdraw consent, please contact us. See the “Contact” section below for contact information.

_Transfers of Personal Data_

Please be aware that the personal data we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location. Argyle relies on Standard Contractual Clauses to legitimize these cross-border data transfers.

_Your Rights_

You have a right to the following:

  * To request access to the personal data we hold about you;
  * To request that we rectify or erase your personal data;
  * To request that we restrict or block the processing of your personal data;
  * Under certain circumstances, to receive personal data about you that we store and transmit to another without hindrance from us, including requesting that we provide your personal data directly to another, i.e., a right to data portability; and
  * Where we previously obtained your consent, to withdraw consent to processing your personal data.



To exercise these rights, see the “Contact” section below. Please be aware that Argyle may be unable to afford these rights to you under certain circumstances, such as if we are legally prevented from doing so.

Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint against us. To do so, contact the supervisory authority in your country of residence.

_Retention_

We will process and store your personal data only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage, or as permitted by law. Argyle stores personal information for up to three (3) years from your last engagement with us. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or the initiation of a contract or for other lawful purposes.

### Your Choices
