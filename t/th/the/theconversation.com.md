Here we aim to help you to understand what information we might collect about you and how we use it. In this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information or an opinion about a person whose identity is apparent, or can be reasonably ascertained, from the information or opinion.

### Data protection principles

  3. Adequate, relevant & not excessive
  4. Accurate
  5. Not kept longer than necessary
  6. Processed in accordance with your rights
  7. Secure
  8. Not transferred to countries without adequate protection



We will always follow these principles and ask you how you would like us to communicate with you.
