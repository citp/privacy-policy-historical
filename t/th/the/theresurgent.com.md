This privacy policy applies only to www.theresurgent.com. This policy does not apply to information collected through any other website or to the practices of companies that The Resurgent does not control. Please note that our site may contain links to other websites. For example, if you click on an advertisement on The Resurgent and link to another website, then this privacy policy will not apply to any information collected on that website.

## General Statement about Data Collection & Targeted Advertising

The Resurgent website permits data collection for interest-based advertising. We and third parties may use cookies, web beacons or pixels, mobile ad identifiers, and other tracking technologies to facilitate site navigation, to better understand and improve our services, and to determine or improve the advertising shown to you on this website or elsewhere. We may use your information to facilitate the delivery of targeted ads and promotions on behalf of ourselves and advertisers on this website. This information may be combined with information collected across different websites, online services, and other linked or associated devices.

We and third parties may use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and e-mails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a specific e-mail message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and determine the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing the use of our services and providing content and ads that are of greater relevance to you.
