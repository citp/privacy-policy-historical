**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we decide to make a material change in this privacy policy, we will post it on this page. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of changes to this privacy policy will mean you accept these changes.

If we make any material changes in our privacy practices that affect your personally identifiable information that is already in our possession, we will apply those changes to that older information only with your consent or as otherwise allowed by law.
