# Privacy and Terms of Service | truth

HERE COMES A LOT OF **LEGAL  MUMBO JUMBO**. SO, EVEN IF YOU’RE BORED TO TEARS, READ IT AND THEN CHECK OUT THE REST OF OUR WEBSITE.

###  Privacy Policy 

[www.thetruth.com](http://www.thetruth.com/) is a website of Truth Initiative, which is dedicated to achieving a culture where all youth and young adults reject tobacco.  We respect your privacy and have created this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect through the website and how we use it.  If you have any questions about this policy, please [contact us](https://truthinitiative.org/contact-us).

####  Non-Personally Identifiable User Information 

We automatically collect non-personally identifiable information about our site’s users, including the domain name and IP address of visitors, the browser and operating system used, the date and time of each visit and the source of referral.  This information does not identify individual visitors, and it is used for our own research purposes and to improve the site’s content, structure, and security.

####  Cookies 

Cookies are information files that allow websites to remember users’ activities on a website.  When you visit our site, we may send one or more cookies to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.  We use the information we learn from cookies to improve the quality of our service, for example, by tracking user trends.  We do not use cookies to track user activity on an individual basis. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some of our features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

####  Personally Identifiable Information 

We collect personally identifiable information from you through the site (such as your name, mailing address or email address) when you choose to sign up for our newsletter or otherwise voluntarily provide such information to us. We use your personally identifiable information to create a customized digital experience through the various truth platforms, for analytics, personalization and tracking, and for the purpose for which it was provided, (for example, to add you to our newsletter distribution list or to respond to a query). If you provide us with your email address, we may begin sending you emails with information that we think will be of interest to you. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving emails from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any email you receive. If you provide your cell phone number to us, you consent to receive autodialed messages and texts at that number on any subject from us, unless and until you request that such messages stop.

We also use personal information about users to our website to better understand how people use our site so that we can improve the website and its offerings.  

Unfortunately, given the complexity of privacy regulations outside the United States, we do not profile, personalize, track or create customized digital experience for IP addresses that appear to come from outside the United States.  As a result, you may not have the benefit of full digital platform experience.    
 

####  Security 

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or disclosure or destruction of our users' data.  We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to perform their jobs. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee that your information is 100% secure.

####  Sharing Personal Information 

We may share your personal information with other like-minded organizations, government officials or other policy-makers, or the press if we believe it will help advance our mission of achieving a culture where all youth and young adults reject tobacco and drugs.

We may also share your information if you provide the information in a context where you would expect the information to be shared.  For instance, if you choose to sign a truth-sponsored petition with your name and email address, we may share that information with the party receiving the petition.

We may use third party service providers to help us operate our website or administer activities on our behalf. We may share personal information about our users with these third parties for those limited purposes, but we require that such third parties protect the confidentiality of user information and use it for no other purpose.

In addition, we will share personally identifiable information about our users when required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. We will also share personally identifiable information if we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of us or others.

We may also share personally identifiable information in connection with, or during negotiations of, a merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another entity. Moreover, we may share personally identifiable information about a user upon the user’s consent.

We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personally identifiable information regarding our website users with third parties.

####  Third Party Websites 

We may provide links from our website to other websites. We do not control the content or links that appear on these third party websites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our site.  For instance, these other websites may use cookies to track and profile people.  These third-party websites and services have their own privacy policies.  Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites that have a link to or from our site, is subject to that website’s own terms and policies. **This Privacy Policy covers only information collected through the use of this website**. In addition, we do not currently respond to web browser “do not track” signals.

####  Adobe Cloud Marketing Coop 

Truth Initiative participates in the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op to better understand how you use our website and apps across the various devices you use, and to deliver tailored promotions and communications. Learn more at [https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com](https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com/) about how Adobe does this.

####  Compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 

Protecting the privacy of the young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect information at the website from those we know are under 13, and no part of the website is structured to attract anyone under 13. If we become aware of having information about anyone under 13, we will promptly delete the information, unless we obtain consent from the parent or legal guardian of the child to retain such information.

####  California Privacy Rights 

If you reside in California and have provided your personally identifiable information to us, you may request information once per calendar year about our disclosures of certain categories of your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests may be submitted to us at [contact us](https://truthinitiative.org/contact-us).

####  Changes to this Privacy Policy 

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage our website users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about what information we collect and how we use that information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and become aware of any modifications since your last visit.

####  Arbitration 

For any dispute you have with Truth Initiative regarding the Site shall be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and judgment upon the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The prevailing party in any such arbitration shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees from the other party.  However, nothing shall prevent either you or Truth Initiative from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Site.  ANY AND ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.

You will indemnify and hold harmless Truth Initiative and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any and all claims arising out of or related to (1) your Content and/or (2) your use of, or your inability to use, this Application or the information contained therein.
