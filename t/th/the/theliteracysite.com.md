# Privacy @ The Literacy Site

For questions regarding this privacy statement, please contact [customerservice@theliteracysite.com](mailto:customerservice@theliteracysite.com). 

GreaterGood Network, owners and operators of The Hunger Site, The Breast Cancer Site, The Child Health Site, The Literacy Site, The Rainforest Site, The Animal Rescue Site, Pink Ribbon Store, Global Girlfriend, Museum Shop, Ecology Fund, and GreaterGood.com, has created this privacy statement to spell out our firm commitment to individual privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. 

GreaterGood Network respects the privacy of its visitors. You are not required to provide any personal information to visit the site and click. Site visitors can voluntarily provide personal information to sign up for an e-newsletter, our click reminder e-mails, a "Take Action!" campaign, or other notifications regarding the site. If you do so, we will use the information you provide to send you a periodic e-mail. We may also share your personal information with not-for-profit groups in furtherance of their charitable missions. 

When you sign a "Take Action!" campaign at any one of the GreaterGood Network sites, we will never sell your name, e-mail or mailing address, or other personally identifiable information to any for-profit entity; however, we will share this personal information with not-for-profit groups in furtherance of their charitable missions. All signing personal information, including name, address, city, state, country and comments are considered public information and will be provided to the target of the campaign (for example, sending a letter and petition to the Surgeon General). Specific targets for a campaign will be clearly identified within each campaign. Name, city, state, country and comments will also be visible on the website unless you have selected the "Do not display my name" checkbox available within each campaign during signing. We will *not* display street or e-mail addresses entered into the proper "E-mail" or "Address" fields during signing. 

When you purchase something at one of the GreaterGood Network stores, we will never sell your name, cause affiliation, e-mail address, shopping preferences or other personally identifiable information to any for-profit entity; however, when you purchase a Gift That Gives More™, we may sell or share your personal information with not-for-profit groups in furtherance of their charitable missions. For fulfillment purposes, our drop ship vendors are notified of your name, shipping and e-mail addresses. You may receive promotional materials from these vendors. When you purchase a Gift That Gives More™, you may receive communication directly from the charitable partner who fulfills the gift, and we may sell or share your personal information with other not-for-profit groups in furtherance of their charitable missions. 

GreaterGood Network uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Web sites. IP addresses are not linked to anything personally identifiable. 

Each of our websites contains links to other websites, including sponsor websites and other philanthropic websites. GreaterGood Network is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites and encourages you to independently review these companies' privacy policies.

GreaterGood Network (owner & operator of The Literacy Site) makes every effort to be in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. The following explains the Act and what GreaterGood Network does to meet its requirements. 

## About the Act

If you operate a commercial Web site or an online service directed to children under 13 that collects personal information from children or if you operate a general audience Web site and have actual knowledge that you are collecting personal information from children, you must comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and Rule apply to individually identifiable information about a child that is collected online, such as full name, home address, e-mail address, telephone number or any other information that would allow someone to identify or contact the child. The Act and Rule also cover other types of information -- for example, hobbies, interests and information collected through cookies or other types of tracking mechanisms — when they are tied to individually identifiable information. 

## How GreaterGood Network Complies with the Act

GreaterGood Network does not collect individually identifiable information about children. Registration and subscription services are for persons aged 13 and older only. We request that no child under 13 register on our site. 

If you have questions or concerns about GreaterGood Network's compliance with the Act, please contact us at GreaterGood Network: (206) 859-5201 or e-mail: [customerservice@theliteracysite.com](mailto:customerservice@theliteracysite.com).
