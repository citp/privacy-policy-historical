### Disclosing information to others

The Game Collection will never sell or share your personal information with third parties unless it is required to fulfil your order or to fulfil another function, which you have consented to. Should we employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf (including fulfilling orders, analysing data, sending e-mails and postal mail), we will ensure that they only use such information under our direction and that they have adequate procedures in place to deal with your data securely. Some of these companies may be based outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). If we transfer your data to these companies we will ensure that they process your data in accordance with this privacy policy and the Data Protection Act. 

### Fraud Protection Systems

To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases. By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. 

### Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data and take online security very seriously, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

### How we use cookies

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. They are widely used in order to help websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide general usage information to the owners of the site. We use cookies to manage your login and placing of an order on our store. If you do not allow cookies sadly you will be unable to complete the checkout process.

### 3rd Party Cookies

The Game Collection also makes use of Third Party Cookies to enable the below listed features of our website to function. Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, in order to have a Facebook like button on our website. That like button will set a cookie that can be read only by Facebook. That would be considered a third-party cookie. These cookies are not essential to make a purchase and can be disabled if you wish.

On each of our product pages we have buttons to enable sharing pages that you think your friends may find useful. These buttons are for the commonly used social media networks Facebook, Twitter and Google+. 

**Facebook Like Button**  
"If you're logged into Facebook and visit a website with the Like button, your browser sends us information about your visit. Since the Like button is a little piece of Facebook embedded on another website, the browser is sending info about the request to load Facebook content on that page. 

We record some of this info to help show you a personalized experience on that site and to improve our products. For example, when you go to a website with a Like button, we need to know who you are in order to show you what your Facebook friends have liked on that site. The data we receive includes your user ID, the website you're visiting, the date and time and other browser-related info. 

If you're logged out or don't have a Facebook account and visit a website with the Like button or another social plugin, your browser sends us a more limited set of info. For example, because you're not logged into Facebook, you'll have fewer cookies than someone who's logged in. Like other sites on the Internet, we receive info about the web page you're visiting, the date and time and other browser-related info. We record this info to help us improve our products."  
<https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/cookies>

**Twitter Tweet button**  
"Like many companies, Twitter receives log data from visits to websites that use our social widgets, such as our Tweet and Follow buttons. This log data may include information such as IP address, browser type, the referring web page, pages visited, cookies, and other interactions with the buttons or widgets as outlined in the Twitter privacy policy:   
<https://twitter.com/privacy>" 

**Google +1 button**  
Google doesn't keep a persistent record of your browsing history as part of the process of showing you a +1 button or otherwise use the fact that you personally have visited a page with the +1 button. The +1 button isn't used to track your visits across the web. Google may keep some information about your visit, usually for about two weeks, to maintain and debug its systems. This information isn't organized by individual profiles, usernames, or URLs. 

If you click on a Google +1 button, in order to store your +1 and make it visible to the public, Google receives information about your Google profile, the URL you +1, your IP address, and other browser-related information. If you undo your +1, this information will be deleted. You can see all your +1's in the +1's tab of your profile.
