**Information Collection**

**Information Collection**   
TheDollPalace.com is the sole owner of the information collected on www.thedollpalace.com. WE DO NOT SHARE ANY USER PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES. We do provide general statistics and demographics for our advertisers; however that information is not related to any particular TDP user profile. TheDollPalace.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

**Registration**   
In order to use some of the features of this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide valid demographic information, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

**Order**   
All current orders are processed with paypal.com. We do not store any information from your order form except your email address. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date) to paypal.com during the order.This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. 

**Information Use**

**Profile**   
We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.Consequently, collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them.We do not share your profile with other third parties. 

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. [(Internet Explorer and Netscape Instructions)](https://web.archive.org/web/20061222162615id_/http://www.thedollpalace.com/privacy/cookies.php)

If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our posting sections, contests or monthly drawings that take place. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.See the “Profile” section. 

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. 

**Third Party Advertising**   
The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users directly by The Doll Palace. Internal user information is used to serve ads to users on this site, however this information is not shared with any of our advertisers. We provide advertisers only with general click-through banner statistics. 

This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by TheDollPalace.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

**Log Files**   
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**   
We employ and our third party advertising company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are not tied to users’ personally identifiable information. 

Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company.That means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the advertising company would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs, please go to [http://www.linkshare.com](http://www.linkshare.com/). 

In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients.This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section.
