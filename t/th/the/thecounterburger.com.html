            <font color="#3e647e"><strong>Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong></font><br>
            You do not have to provide any personal information to us in order to use our Site. You control how much or how little personal information you submit to us. You can send us your personal information in a variety of ways. If you communicate with us by email or through an online form on this Site, we will collect your name, email address, and the additional information that you provide. Online forms permit you to, among other things, subscribe to The Counter® e-zines, provide us feedback, and ask questions. Participating in some online services may require you to register. We use this information in the following ways:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide you with the information and/or services that you have requested, such as your request to receive The Counter® e-zines or to identify The Counter® restaurant near your home.</li>
                <li>To enhance our customers' experiences in our restaurant and on our Site.</li>
                <li>To measure the effectiveness of our online and offline marketing efforts and to develop products, services, and marketing programs. This analysis may include combining personal data drawn from online and offline sources.</li>
                <li>We may use third party suppliers and service providers to facilitate our Site and may make personal information available to them to the extent necessary for them to host our Site or to provide other services to The Counter®. Whenever we do this, we require that our third party suppliers and service providers agree to maintain the confidentiality of the personal information we provide to them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>
            We do not sell or rent to third parties any of the personal information that consumers and investors provide to us online, but we may share your information with our affiliates, our The Counter® franchisees, and/or lenders to and/or investors in our company. Primarily, we share information with these third parties only to respond to your specific request or to obtain their advice on how to improve our business. We do not authorize third parties unaffiliated with The Counter® to make independent use of your information for their own purposes, such as for direct marketing.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#3e647e"><strong>Gift Cards</strong></font><br>
            We use a third party service provider to facilitate the gift card service that we may make available to you. The information that you submit while placing a gift card order ("Gift Card Information"), including your name, address, email address, phone number and credit card information, is collected by our third party gift card service provider. The Counter® does not collect or store your Gift Card Information and will not share this information with other third parties. We require our gift card service provider to maintain the confidentiality of the Gift Card Information that you submit and to use the Gift Card Information only for purposes related to fulfilling and tracking your order, providing you with related customer service and for reporting purposes. Please review the privacy policy on the gift card service site for specific information. We also require our gift card service provider to maintain your Gift Card Information on a secure server and to use at least industry standard encryption technology and security procedures for all payment processing. Please also see the Links to Other Sites section below.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#3e647e"><strong>Franchise Inquiries</strong></font><br>
            All information submitted to The Counter® on our Request for Consideration form is used only to assist in the screening of potential franchisees and will be kept confidential.<br>
            <br>
            On the Request For Consideration form, we will collect your name, address, email address, other contact information, and certain financial information and qualifications information that you must enter on the form. By submitting this information, you agree that The Counter® may retain and use the information to respond to your inquiry, to evaluate you as a potential franchisee including consenting to allow us to conduct a background check on you including but not limited to credit history, criminal record and DMV records and to help us improve our franchise marketing efforts. Information on your online form will become part of any application for a franchise that you might later submit. We may disclose your personal information to our business units, agents, affiliates and to other third parties as part of our consideration of any subsequent franchise application.

            <br>
            <font color="#3e647e"><strong>Contests</strong></font><br>
            On occasion, The Counter® may conduct contests with the opportunity to win prizes. Each contest has its own terms and conditions ("Official Contest Rules"). As part of entering a contest on-line, certain personally identifiable information (such as name, address, phone number, etc.) may be required. This information will be used as described in the applicable Official Contest Rules.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#3e647e"><strong>Promotions</strong></font><br>
            This Site may allow you to obtain various promotions offered by The Counter® which can be redeemed at any participating location in the United States during the dates specified on the particular coupon.

This information will only be used to track the number of promotions being downloaded by zip code or restaurant in order to allow The Counter® restaurants to adequately plan for promotion redemption. There is no limit to the number of promotions you can obtain from this Site, however applicable terms and conditions appear on the coupon itself.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#3e647e"><strong>Job Application Information</strong></font><br>
            We collect employment application information through this Site. You may also fax your résumé to The Counter® restaurant near you. We protect the confidentiality of such information, but this online Privacy Policy does not apply to such faxes because they occur offline.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#3e647e"><strong>Press Information</strong></font><br>
            If you are a member of the press, The Counter® will collect your name and contact information in order to respond to your inquiry submitted on our Press Room web page. We may store your personal information and inquiries for future reference.<br>

            The Counter® recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of children. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen years. This Site is directed to adults at least eighteen years old, and when a user discloses personal information on this Site, the user is representing to us that he or she is an adult. If a child has provided this Site with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@thecounterburger.com?subject=Remove%20Child%20Information">info@thecounterburger.com</a>, and we will promptly delete the child's information from our records.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#3e647e"><strong>Security of Your Personal Information</strong></font><br>
            The Counter® limits access to personal information about you to employees with a reasonable need to know in order to provide products or services to you.<br>
            <br>
            We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. We use reasonable efforts to help keep your personal information secure. Any purchases that you make through the Site are actually made after you link to the secure servers of our payment partner, and your credit card information will not be available to us. Certain browsers will not permit communication through secure servers. If this is the case, you will not be able to place an order online. You will need to download a different browser or contact us at the address set forth below.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#3e647e"><strong>Secure Shopping</strong></font><br>
