### COMMUNICATING WITH YOU

We will contact you (including by email or post) with information about our products, services and offers which either you request, or which we believe you may be interested in (including through newsletters, alerts, and reminders about recurring event sales), unless you have told us that you don’t want to receive these message, or, otherwise, if it is in our legitimate interests, for business development and marketing purposes.

Information stored in log files may include IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and other information.

We collect this information through the use of cookies and other similar technologies. We use this information to analyze demographic and other trends, administer the site, track aggregate usage of the Site, and provide you with relevant advertising.

Where we use cookies on our Site, you may block these at any time. To do so, you can activate the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), you will not be able to access all or parts of our Site or to use all the functionality provided through our Site.

For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them, please refer to our [cookies policy](https://www.therealreal.com/privacy#cookies). By continuing to use our Site and/or our services, you are agreeing to our use of cookies as described in our cookies policy.

We may disclose personal information pursuant to a request from law enforcement or pursuant to other legal or regulatory process, or as otherwise required by law, or, in our sole discretion, to protect our rights, property or interests, including to enforce this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.

In our sole discretion, we may also disclose information we collect to a third party when we believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate or prevent harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal conduct, including to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or any other agreement or to respond to any claims, or to protect our rights or the rights of a third party.

We will also disclose your personal information to third parties where it is in our legitimate interests to do so to run, grow and develop our business. Information collected from this Site may also be transferred as part of a merger or other combination, or as part of a restructuring, bankruptcy, transfer of assets, or to our successors in interest.

### RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We keep your personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is processed.

### TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

The RealReal is based in the United States and therefore personal information collected from this Site and provided in connection with The RealReal Services will be transferred to and processed in the United States, and may be transferred and processed to other countries outside of your country of residence. We may also transfer personal information to service providers or other third parties with whom we have contractual agreements.

Further details on the steps we take to protect your personal information in these cases is available from us on request by contacting us at any time.

### THIRD PARTY WEBSITES

This Site contains links to other websites provided by third parties. Please be aware that we do not control these third party websites or any of the content contained on those websites. Once you have left our Site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage you to exercise caution and to read the privacy policy for the website you visit. The inclusion of hyperlinks to third party websites on our site in no way constitutes an endorsement by us of such websites' content, actions or policies.

### AGGREGATED INFORMATION

We may share aggregated information about you with third parties. Aggregated information is non-personal information about you that is combined with the non-personal information of other users. We may not limit the third parties' use of the aggregated information.

### YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

California's "Shine The Light" law permits California residents to annually request and obtain information free of charge about what personal information is disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. The RealReal does not distribute your personal information to outside parties for their direct marketing, except as provided for in this Privacy Policy, without your consent.

### ACCESS BY CHILDREN OR MINORS

Our Site is not directed to children under the age of 13, and our Terms of Service prohibit minors from using our Site or Service. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.

### SECURITY

We take precautions to protect information that we collect from our Users. We protect the information entrusted to us by taking all reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information, including through use of appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards and measures. These protections include restricting access to personal information to employees who need the information to perform a specific job. The RealReal provides its employees training on its security and privacy practices. Technical safeguards and measures include use of encryption, passwords for access to our systems and use of anti-virus software.

However, in the course of provision of your personal data to us, your personal information may be transferred over the internet. Although we make every effort to protect the personal information which you provide to us, no information security safeguards can be guaranteed to be completely secure, so you should use caution whenever providing personal information online, electronically or otherwise. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access to it.

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access your online account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

## WHAT ARE COOKIES?

Cookies are small text files which are sent to your browser when you visit our website. When you visit our website again, the cookie allows our website to recognise your browser. When you visit our website, cookies may also be sent to your browser by other websites that are used for advertisements on other sites you may visit.

Cookies are useful because they help us make your website experience more enjoyable. They allow us to recognise your device (e.g. your laptop or mobile device) so that we can tailor your experience of our website. You can find out more about cookies at: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

## WHY DO WE USE COOKIES?

Cookies do lots of different jobs on this website, such as letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, remembering your username and password, enabling you to keep goods in your shopping basket, letting us analyse how well our website is performing, and improving your experience. They also help ensure that advertisements you see while you are on other websites are more relevant to you and your interests.

## WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?

We want you to understand the different types of cookies that we use on our website. Some of these cookies are essential to the operation of our website. Others are not essential but help to improve our website by collecting user information or try and improve your experience of our website by remembering your choices.

Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions:

### TYPE 1 – STRICTLY NECESSARY COOKIES – WHICH ENABLE SERVICES YOU HAVE SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR

We use several cookies which are essential to the operation of this website. For example, these types of cookies let us identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription-only areas of this website, enable our website to remember the goods that you add to your shopping cart, provide the necessary security your visit to our website requires, and help ensure the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, services that you have asked for cannot be provided.

### TYPE 2 – PERFORMANCE COOKIES – WHICH COLLECT ANONYMOUS INFORMATION ABOUT THE WEB PAGES YOU VISIT

These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, for example, which pages our visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages on those pages. These performance cookies don't collect information that identifies you as an individual – all information they collect is aggregated and anonymous. The information gathered is only used to improve how our website works.

We use Google Analytics on our website to help us analyse how our website is used. You can find out more about this popular website analytics tool here: <http://www.google.com/analytics/index.html>. Google Analytics uses performance cookies to track visitor interactions. For example, by using cookies Google can tell us which pages our users view, which are most popular, what time of day our website is visited, whether visitors have been to our website before, what website referred the visitor to our website, and other similar information. All this information is anonymized. Google takes the privacy and security of your Google Analytics data seriously and you can find out more about how it protects your data here: <http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html>.

### TYPE 3 – FUNCTIONALITY COOKIES – WHICH REMEMBER YOUR CHOICES TO IMPROVE YOUR EXPERIENCE.

These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make, such as, remembering your username, the region you are in, and changes you make to various other parts of our website which you can customise, such as your MySales page. The aim of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience so that you don't have to reset your preferences each time you visit us.

### TYPE 4 – TARGETING OR ADVERTISING COOKIES WHICH REMEMBER YOUR BROWSING HABITS TO TRY AND DISPLAY RELEVANT ADVERTISING WHEN YOU VISIT OTHER ONLINE SITES.

These cookies track your browsing habits so that we can show you advertising which we hope is relevant to your interests. We believe it is useful to show you advertisements that are tailored to your interests. These advertising cookies use information about your web browsing activity to group you with other users who have similar interests and show you advertisements based upon those interests. For example, these cookies may remember that on our website you viewed pages relating to particular products. Based on that information, with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies on your browser to enable them to show you those products while you visit other sites.

These types of cookies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

## WE MAY TRACK WHETHER YOU OPEN EMAILS THAT WE SEND

Our emails may contain a web beacon to track who opens an email, when, and whether that user clicks on any of the links in the email. We may use this information to help us analyse which of our users are interested in particular topics. When you delete the email, the web beacon will be deleted.

## HOW TO MANAGE COOKIES ON OUR WEBSITE

Cookies do lots of important jobs on our website and help to make your online experience more personal and more enjoyable.

By using our website, you are deemed to consent to the use of cookies as described in this cookie policy.

However, you can disable all our cookies if you choose. If you do so, you may find that significant parts of our website do not work at all, or do not work correctly.

## DISABLING COOKIES

If you would like to disable targeting, advertising or cookies, which remember your browsing habits and try and display relevant advertising when you are online, you can visit <http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices>. If you choose to turn off these cookies you will still see advertising on the internet, but it may not be tailored to your interests. It does not mean that you won't be served any advertisements whilst you are online. Whilst many companies involved in using targeting, advertising or cookies and serving online behavioural advertising appear at the above link, not all do. Therefore, even if you choose to turn off cookies used by all the companies listed, you may still receive some targeting, advertising or cookies and some tailored advertisements from other companies.

You can also manage this type of cookie in the privacy settings on the web browser you are using. Please see below for more information.

## DISABLING OTHER COOKIES

You can disable and/or delete all types of cookies by using your browser settings. Cookies are generally easy to disable and/or delete but how you do so varies from browser to browser. The "help" function within your browser should tell you how to do it. The best way may be to close your browser and then search for "cookie folder" or "cookie manager" or simply "cookie".
