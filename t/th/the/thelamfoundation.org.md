# The LAM Foundation :: Privacy Policy

We provide this notice explaining our information practices. Please note that by visiting this site you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

### Information We Collect & How We Use It

Two types of information are collected, including: personal, or "individually identifiable," information you provide to us or standard web server/visitor traffic information, commonly referred to as "aggregate information," regarding overall Web site traffic patterns. We do not report on individual user sessions. Normally, web servers collect this type of basic information as part of their web log processes.  
 _  
Individually Identifiable Information_  
There are instances when The LAM Foundation requests individually identifiable information from its users. Examples include: volunteer recruitment, product ordering, information requests, contributions, etc. Individually identifiable user information we may request includes: first and last name; street address, city, state and zip code; telephone number; email address; and subject of inquiry (i.e. volunteering or information requests).

In the case of contributions or product ordering, we process standard credit card information (card number, card type, expiration date) via a secure, encrypted SSL session. SSL is the proven standard for secure web messaging transactions. Through the use of a unique cookie id, we save previous donation information as a time saving convenience for donors. The "cookie" is used during a secure, encrypted SSL session when contributing online.

In the case of memorial and honor contributions, a personalized letter is sent to a designated recipient. Therefore, we will request the name, address, city, state, zip code and telephone number for the designated recipient. This information is only used for the purpose of sending the gift card.

### Aggregate Information

In addition to information provided by our visitors, we use the normal Internet tracking tools associated with standard Internet protocols and web based systems. This system information is typically stored in log files and the information is used for aggregate reporting. Aggregate reporting includes: total number of visitors, most visited sections, peak traffic times, etc. Log files are simply transaction records web servers maintain. Those logs are used for recording information, such as:

Service provider IP addresses;  
Browser versions;  
Referring Web sites;  
Search terms used;  
Average number of pages requested;  
Average duration of visit; and  
Total visitor traffic.

We use aggregate information gathered from your visit to better design our Web site. This information gives us a broad picture of how people use our Web site in order to help the management of our systems and to better serve our audience.

### Donation Information

We maintain records of all contributions to The LAM Foundation. Personal information is private and confidential. Additionally, all information is stored in a secure location accessible only by authorized staff. The LAM Foundation may contact you with further communications. If you wish to restrict the use of your contact information, you can choose to opt out from financial contribution activities or any contact with The LAM Foundation.

Please let us know this by calling The LAM Foundation at 1-877-CURE-LAM or via mail at:

### Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we strive to maintain physical, electronic and administrative safeguards to secure the information we collect online. This includes the use of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Blackbaud's Merchant system for processing contributions securely.
