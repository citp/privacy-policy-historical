# zNET Privacy Policy

**zNET** ™ ******PRIVACY POLICY**

Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet’s vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how zNET collects information from all end users of zNET’s Internet services (the “Services”)—those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts (“Visitors”) as well as those who pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service (“Subscribers”)—what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Subscribers have concerning the collection and use of such information. zNET requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.

**Personal Information zNET Collects and How It Is Used**

**Introduction**  
zNET collects information in different ways from Visitors and Subscribers who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below.

**Registration**  
Subscribers are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Subscribers during the registration process is used to manage each Member’s account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. However, in instances where zNET and a partner jointly promote the Services, zNET may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. zNET may also generate nonidentifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Subscribers provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Subscribers). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and nonidentifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.

**Online Shopping**  
At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient’s name, address, and phone number. zNET has no control over the third parties’ use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.

**Online Advertisements**  
zNET displays our online advertisements. We share aggregated and nonidentifying information about our Visitors and Subscribers collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and nonidentifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser tells us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and nonidentifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. zNET does not share personal information about its Visitors or Subscribers with these advertisers.

**Responses to Email Inquiries**  
When Visitors or Subscribers send email inquiries to zNET, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. zNET does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.

**Voluntary Customer Surveys**  
We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.

We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other zNET customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.

**Special Cases**  
It is zNET’s policy not to use or share the personal information about Visitors of Subscribers in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, zNET may disclose personal information about Visitors or Subscribers, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20030410190921id_/http%3A//www.znet.com/terms.html) or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect zNET and our Subscribers.

**zNET's Commitment to Children's Privacy**  
Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws.

We believe that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision. For further information about tips, tools, age-appropriate or kid-friendly Web sites and how to report online trouble, please visit [www.getnetwise.org](http://www.getnetwise.org/).

Finally, zNET recommends that children ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to zNET, or to anyone else online.

**zNET's Commitment to Data Security**  
Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining this information.

**How to Access or Modify Your Information**  
zNET offers Subscribers the opportunity to access or modify information provided during registration. To access or modify such information, visit [our "Manage My Account"](https://web.archive.org/web/20030410190921id_/http%3A//www.znet.com/manage.html) page or contact our Customer Service Department at 800.438.9638
