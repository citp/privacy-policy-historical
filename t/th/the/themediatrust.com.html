        <h3>Privacy Notice</h3>
        <p>
            Media Trust is committed to the privacy of all visitors to its website. To that end, Media Trust has established this
            Privacy Policy ("Policy") to protect each visitor's privacy. This Policy explains what and how Media Trust collects, uses,

        <br>
        
        <h3>Collection, Use, Disclosure of Information</h3>
        <p>
            Media Trust does not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you choose to provide us personally
            identifiable information through an online form or e-mail communication or you are accessing client-specific, secure
            content. We may use cookies to ensure authorized access to client-specific secure content. Our use of cookies is explained in
            greater detail below. When accessing client-specific secure content, you are acting as a representative of your company
            and your interactions with our site in this capacity are governed by our relationship agreement with your company.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our site also automatically creates logs regarding your and other user sessions on TheMediaTrust.com, such as features
            that you use, the actions that you take, and the information that you access. We generally use this information in
            statistical and aggregate formats to assess the effectiveness of our site and to better understand your priorities and
            interests.
        </p>

            Media Trust does not sell, distribute or disclose your personally identifiable information collected from
            TheMediaTrust.com to third parties without your consent. However, we may release information to a third party if
            required by a legal process such as a subpoena or a search warrant. Please note that visitors to TheMediaTrust.com are
            not required to provide us personally identifiable information to use the public areas of our site. You can provide us
