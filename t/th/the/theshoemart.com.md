### Our Privacy Statement

**We neither sell nor share your information with outside companies or third parties.**

When you purchase from our online store, we collect your name, billing and shipping addresses, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information. You provide this information so we can process and ship your order. We respect your privacy by not selling or sharing this information.

We encourage you to sign-up for our e-mailing list. These letters provide you with advanced notice of store sales, new merchandise, and other store-related events. But, of course, you have the freedom to add or remove your name from our list at any time.

### Online Security

**Protecting your information is our highest priority.** We have developed several safeguards to keep your information completely confidential. To proceed to checkout, you must enter your e-mail address and create a password. The checkout process itself employs Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)* technology to insure your safety.

*Secure Sockets Layer encrypts your order information and sends it to a secure server, making it impossible for that information to be decoded by a party outside of the store you shop with.

Furthermore, only our store will have your information; other members of the urbanStyle community will not have access to your information unless you decide to shop with them.

To check the security of your connection during checkout, look for the unbroken key or closed lock at the bottom of your browser window. This indicates SSL is active.
