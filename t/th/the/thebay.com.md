##### Hbc is protecting your privacy

For over 335 years, Hudson's Bay Company (Hbc) has been a name that means trust in this country. We value you as our customer, and want to assure you that our 70,000 associates are committed to upholding the trust you've placed in us as Canada's oldest corporation and largest department store retailer.

Hbc's Principles for the Protection of Personal Information were created to ensure we preserve the confidentiality, accuracy and security of your personal information. These principles guide us in the collection, use, retention and disclosure of your personal information in all of our Hbc family of stores and services: the Bay, Zellers, Home Outfitters, Fields, Hbc Credit, Hbc Rewards and Hbc Insurance. 

### The information that we collect

Personal information means any information about an identifiable individual. This includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, birth date, purchase information or e-mail address. As a customer, you provide Hbc with this information in a variety of ways, such as when making a purchase, applying for an Hbc Credit Card, enrolling in our Hbc Rewards program, entering in-store contests or signing up for our Gift Registry program. In every case, Hbc adheres to strict guidelines when dealing with your personal information.

### Collecting your personal information

Hbc collects and uses personal information in connection with providing you with goods and services. When you provide Hbc with personal information, we will inform you as to why we are collecting it. Hbc obtains your consent for the collection of your personal information. In some instances, where the purpose for collection is obvious, your consent is implied. Hbc will ask for your permission to collect additional information that may be useful in serving you in the future.

### Using and disclosing your personal information

Hbc only uses and discloses your personal information for the marketing purposes identified to you when your consent to the collection of your personal information was obtained. Hbc does not provide your personal information for marketing purposes of other organizations without your consent. You can withdraw, at any time, your consent for the use of your personal information that is not required for a transaction subject to legal restrictions and upon reasonable notice to Hbc. Your information may be retained by Hbc for audit or archival purposes.

### Maintaining and safeguarding your personal information

Hbc strives to ensure that our security measures protect against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use, disclosure or modification of your personal information. Hbc limits access to your personal information to those Hbc associates who may need it for use in accordance with Hbc's established privacy principles. Hbc associates sign an annual Code of Conduct, which requires them to keep your personal information confidential and comply with our security standards. Hbc keeps your information for as long as necessary to accomplish the identified purpose and in order to serve you better. Your information is then destroyed according to legislative requirements.

### You are entitled to access your personal information

If you request access to your personal information, Hbc will respond to your request within 30 days. There is no cost for reasonable requests unless you require copies of records. Hbc will advise you of the cost, if any, prior to copying those records. Hbc may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information where the information cannot be separated from the records of others, cannot be disclosed for reasons of security or commercial confidentiality, or is protected by legal privilege.

### Hbc provides you with the answers

Hbc has established a Privacy Office and has appointed a senior executive as its Privacy Officer to ensure that everyone at Hbc complies with our Principles for the Protection of Personal Information. Hbc will investigate and respond to any questions, complaints or requests for information you may have.

| 

There are several instances where you are required to give us your personal information for operational and/or administrative purposes. For example, we require your personal information in order to manage your Hbc Rewards account, deliver an item to you that you may have purchased, or maintain your gift registry. Giving us your personal information for these kinds of _primary_ operational purposes is necessary to obtain certain products and services from Hbc.

_Primary_ purposes are those purposes that are operational and are absolutely necessary for Hbc to be able to provide the products and/or services that you request from us. For example, a primary purpose for our collecting your address may be to ensure we can successfully deliver to your home an item you may have purchased.

However, you may not be able to restrict your communications to specific programs. Contact our Privacy Office for more details on your opt-out choices.   
  
**7**

| 

**Q:**

|
