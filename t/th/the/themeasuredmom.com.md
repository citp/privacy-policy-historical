**Subscriber Newsletters**

If you join The Measured Mom or Teaching Every Reader newsletter, you will be required to give your first name and email address. I require your email address to send you the emails, and I require a first name so that the emails will be more personal.

Your data is collected and then passed on to Convertkit, my email service provider.You can [read its privacy policy here](https://convertkit.com/privacy/).Tags are used within Convertkit to track your actions and page visits so that future emails can better meet your needs.

I send several emails per week. Occasionally I will send additional emails about special offers.

If you sign up for the newsletter and receive a subscriber freebie at the same time, I collect your information through a third party application called Leadpages. You can [read its privacy policy here.](https://www.leadpages.net/privacy)

Your email and name are never sold, rented, leased, or given away to a third party.

At the bottom of each newsletter you will find information about how to contact the sender, as well as a link to unsubscribe. You may unsubscribe at any time.

When you leave a blog comment, your comment is public and visible. Your email address is never disclosed unless you include it in the main body of the comment.
