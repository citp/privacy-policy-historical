# THR - THR Privacy Statement

**The information we collect**

Users may browse our site anonymously, but in order to participate we require that users provide a valid e-mail address as part of the registration process.  This is the only piece of personally identifiable information we require from users.

We also collect statistics from each visit which are used to help us understand our audience.  The information collected includes the ip address used to connect to the site, the browser used, referring/exit pages, date and time of the connection, and operating system.

As a contributor you may choose to post personally identifiable information in the content of your posts.  If you wish to remove this information after the time allowed to edit posts, please contact a staff member for assistance.  In most cases we are happy to help however we can.

**What we use this information for**

E-mail addresses are used so that staff can communicate with members if problems arise, and to allow members to manage their accounts. For example, users can ask this site to e-mail them in order to:

  * Use the password reset function.
  * Notify them when they receive a new private message, or when a thread they are interested in is replied to.
  * Allow other users to e-mail them, though this is performed in a way that does not disclose the recipient's e-mail address to the sender

Other data collected is used for statistical and quality control purposes.

**How we protect this information**

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, during transmission and once we receive it. 

**Use of cookies**

We use cookies on this site to:

  * Understand and save your preferences for future visits. This includes remembering who you are and keeping you logged in between visits if you choose.
  * Control advertisements. This allows the ad serving software to insure that you are served a mix of ads, rather than serving your the same ad repeatedly. Please note that our advertising provider does _not_ track user activity beyond the timing and frequency of ad delivery; your participation on this site says all we need to know about your interests.
  * Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer a better experience in the future.

We contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to provide aggregate data about the site and help us improve our service.

**Information we disclose to outside parties**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. We may release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, in response to a subpoena, to enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. However, aggregated non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

**Google AdSense Disclosures**

We are incorporating some Google AdSense ads in the mix of advertising shown to web site viewers who are not logged in. If you would prefer not to see ads provided by Google or AdSense, simply log in to your registered account. Registration is free and takes only a couple of minutes. 

Guests are served ads by third party vendors, including Google. These vendors may serve ads based on your prior browsing history. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [advertising opt-out page](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). You can also opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).
