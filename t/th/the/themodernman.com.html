			matter.</p>
		<p><b>Collection and Purpose</b></p>
		<p> We may collect personal information from you in the course of your visit to our website if you input
			any personal information into the website. The purpose for which we collect personal information is to

			The Modern Man does not release your personal information (name, e-mail

			you e-mails containing free tips and advice to the e-mail address you provide us with.
			All of the newsletters that are sent to you by The.Modern.Man.com include unsubscribe instructions.

			information within our organisation.
			We use the highest level of security (up to 256 bit encryption – the level of encryption that banks use)
			to offer totally safe and secure transactions. So, you can rest assured that communications between
			your browser and TheModernMan.com's web servers are private and secure.</p>

			consent to this transfer.</p>
