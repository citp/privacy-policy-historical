# Protecting Your Privacy on Theme Park Insider

Your privacy is important to you, and protecting that privacy is important to me, as a website publisher.

### What information do we collect about you?

As an interactive community where readers provide the bulk of the site's coverage, Theme Park Insider collects and publishes information about its readers when they contribute information to the site. We publish the names and hometowns of people who submit comments to the site, and collect the IP address of everyone who submits a vote or comment. (An IP address is a series of numbers that identifies the computer through which you accessed the Internet. It is not the same as your e-mail address. And for users on dial-up accounts, the IP address we collect is that of the computer you dialed into at your ISP when you logged on.)

Only readers who register with the site may submit comments or vote on attractions. Theme Park Insider uses cookies to tell which readers are registered and who they are. (A "cookie" is a line of text in your browser's folder on your personal computer that includes that website's domain name and a unique user number. The cookie does not reveal any other information on your computer, including your name and passwords.)

If you do not want your name and hometown published on Theme Park Insider, do not register with the site. Readers under age 13 must register via our [TPI Kids](https://web.archive.org/kids/) program. Theme Park Insider reserves the right to republish any comments or articles submitted to it in any medium at any time.

### No spam

We do not rent, lease, sell or reveal this user database to anyone. Nor do we spam our readers, or anyone else, with unsolicited commercial messages. The only e-mails we send to our readers are registration confirmations and an optional daily digest of new discussion topics. If you are interested in getting that daily digest, you can sign up on the discussion board page.

Registered users can send "blind" e-mails to other registered users via the site. We forward those messages without revealing the recipient's e-mail address. Also, those messages are always sent with the same subject line, allowing recipients to filter them.

### No annoying ads

Theme Park Insider does not, has not and will not serve pop-up or pop-under ads on the site. Nor will we try to install "spyware" or other software on your computer. If you see pop-ups, pop-unders or screen "takeover" ads when you visit Theme Park Insider, your computer likely is infected with a spyware or adware program that it downloaded from another site. [Click here](http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/twc/privacy/spyware.mspx) to learn about spyware and how you can remove it from your computer.

We also strongly encourage you to use the free [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) browser from Mozilla to help protect your computer from spyware and viruses that spread via the Internet Explorer browser. If you must use IE, please try the free [Google toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com/) to block pop-ups and set your IE security settings to medium or higher.

The only ads we present on ThemeParkInsider.com are text and banner ads sold and served via Google's AdWords program and Yahoo's Publisher Network. Our travel agent partner, TravelNow, may also run text and graphical banner ads on Theme Park Insider co-branded pages hosted on its site.

We use these third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

### Editorial integrity

Our editorial independence is important to us, so that's why we ask all readers to abide by our [guidelines for writers](https://web.archive.org/ethics/) before submitting comments to the site.

### Readers' support

As a community-driven website, we are only as successful as our readers allow us to be. That's why we invite our readers to link to http://www.themeparkinsider.com, or any other page on the site, and to patronize our travel reservation pages when making travel plans for any reason or occasion.

Also, please do clean your computer of any spyware or adware programs, as those programs hijack weblinks and ad clicks, depriving this and other sites of revenue, which instead goes straight into those spammers' pockets.

Again, this site is a community. If you are uncomfortable participating as a public member of an online community, you are welcome to "lurk" and read the content of this site without adding any of your own. Otherwise, please be aware of the policies and practices described on this page before submitting any statements or content to the site.

Thanks for visiting,  
[Robert Niles](http://www.themeparkinsider.com/contact/), Founder and Editor, ThemeParkInsider.com
