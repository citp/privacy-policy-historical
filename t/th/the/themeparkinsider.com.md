# Privacy policy

**[Theme Park Insider](https://web.archive.org/) > Privacy policy**

ThemeParkInsider.com accepts and collects information from its visitors. Users are required to register with the site - providing their name, hometown and e-mail address - in order to vote or comment on theme park locations. Registered users may also participate on our News and Commentary board, although registration is not required to use that feature.

This site uses "cookies" to track its registered users, so those users do not have to log in every time they load a new page on the site. 

(A "cookie" is a line of text in the cookies.txt file in your browser's folder on your personal computer. When a cookie is set, a web site writes a line of text to the cookies.txt file that includes that web site's domain name and a unique user number. The cookie cannot access any other information on your computer, including your name and passwords.)

The site also collects the IP address of each individual who posts information to the site, and the time of posting, whether that person is registered or not. (An IP address is a series of numbers that identifies the computer through which you accessed the Internet. It is not the same as your e-mail address. And for users on dial-up accounts, the IP address we collect is that of the computer you dialed into at your ISP when you logged on.)

Any information submitted to this site becomes its property, and may be transferred to any subsequent owners of the site, or republished in other media. The current owner does not share the information he collects about the site's users with any third party, except to publicly identify the authors of particular information displayed on the site. Users' e-mail addresses are not made public, however.

Individuals under age 18 should make their parents aware of this privacy policy and obtain their permission before submitting any information to this site. Visitors must be 13 years of age or older to register with the site. If an individual is aware that a person under 13 has registered fraudulently, please [e-mail us](https://web.archive.org/parks/email.cfm) and we will terminate that registration.

ThemeParkInsider.com runs advertising on selected pages of the site, including links to Amazon.com and Lodging.com (as part of those online retailers' associates programs). When a user follows a link from ThemeParkInsider.com to Amazon.com, Lodging.com or another advertiser's site, he or she leaves the ThemeParkInsider.com web site, and the terms of this privacy policy no longer apply.
