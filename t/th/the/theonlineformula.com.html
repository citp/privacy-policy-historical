<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong><strong>A   NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to
comply with the California Act.&nbsp; Various provisions throughout
this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act.&nbsp; In summary,
you must presume that we collect electronic information from all
visitors.&nbsp; This is not usually personally identifiable.&nbsp; If
you purchase a product or service via this website (and thereby become
covered by the Act), the purchase agreement you electronically sign
prior to purchase allows the website to collect and archive all the
personal information you provide and to transmit and/or transfer that
personal information to third parties.&nbsp; There is no way you can
modify this information and you have no right to do so.&nbsp; Under the
terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or receive
any information about our database.&nbsp; In the event that the
website, under advice of counsel agrees to divulge information, the
requesting party must submit whatever information is demanded by the
website in insure that the website is releasing information to the
correct party.&nbsp; Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this
website from complying.&nbsp; While we take measures to ensure that
outside parties do not have access to any information we have about
you, we do not warranty that outside parties will not breach our system
and thus have access to your information.&nbsp; (You should know that
merchant service providers do not allow us access to your credit card
information.)&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also is subject to change
without notice.&nbsp; You are required to read it prior to using the
website.&nbsp; By interacting with the website you agree to the terms
and conditions of the Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By using the website or
purchasing a product through this website, you waive the right to use
state or federal court systems to address complaints and, instead,
agree to use the American Arbitration Association located in a city and
county specified herein.</p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>ABOUT THE   PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</strong></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong>This website routinely collects information
about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.&nbsp; This
information is obtained in various ways, such as:</p>
<p><strong>VISITOR,   SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</strong></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong>Registration means that the Visitor,
Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to
communicate information to this website.&nbsp; This can include pages
or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a
mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it
can include requesting information from the website via email, mail, or
courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other
membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a
product.</p>
<p>Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the
website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant
service processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at the highest level
of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service
provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.</p>
<p><strong>ONLINE   ORDERING</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Online ordering via SSL encrypted
communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant
service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the
website but does not provide complete credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the
process of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city,
state, email address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and,
occasionally a member password.&nbsp; You should consider all this
information available to the website.&nbsp; This information is used to
deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve
its use for general solicitation purposes.</p>
<p><strong>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Website visitors who wish to communicate with
the website do so under two conditions:&nbsp; one, they give their
permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any
‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or
this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; While your email address may or may not be
used to solicit you, it is added to the website's general solicitation
database.</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL   OR TESTIMONIALS</strong></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong>If you are a customer and send an email to
the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the
website collects information about your communication and by
communicating with the site you give your permission to collect,
archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as the
site sees fit.</p>
<p>Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to
be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.</p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;INFORMATION   OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</strong></p>
<p><strong> &nbsp;</strong>Visitors clicking on banners or pop-ups or
hyperlinked advertising, appearing on this website must assume that

and agree to indemnify this site for any damage, intentional or
