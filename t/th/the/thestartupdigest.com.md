**Information from Social Networking Sites**. 

Our Site includes interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking sites (each a “ **SNS** “). If you connect to a SNS through our Site you authorize us to access, use and store the information that you agreed the SNS could provide to us based on your settings on that SNS. We will access, use and store that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can revoke our access to the information you provide in this way at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS. 

**Information we get from others**. 

We may subscribe to databases or contract with third party data providers from which we collect contact, biographic, demographic, and other Personal Data regarding individuals that may be interested in our Events and programs. We may also collect, and combine with other Personal Data we maintain, Personal Data that is publicly available, such as that provided by business networking sites and databases, information related to the organization for which you work and personal interests and skill sets, and other similar information.

We also may obtain information from those in the Techstars network such as our event organizers, contractors, and local representatives who have agreed to a relationship with us in order to deliver our Services. This may include information about potential interest in our programs, company and individual progress, interest in local events, and attendance at other similar events.

**Information automatically collected**

We may automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Site. For example, we may log your computer or mobile device operating system name and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, browser language, screen resolution, the website you visited before browsing to our Site, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and actions on our Site. We collect this information about you using cookies. Please refer to the Cookies and Similar Technologies section below for more details.

**Changes to your personal information**

It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please let us know if your personal information changes during your relationship with us by updating your registration profile or emailing us at [privacy@techstars.com](mailto:privacy@techstars.com).  

**What are cookies and similar technologies?**

We may collect personal information using “ **cookies** “. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. 

We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites or online services.

**Pixel tags**

We may also use technologies that function similarly to cookies called pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) to track the actions of users on our Site. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags can be used, for example, to measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can better understand how users interact with our Site.

**How we use cookies and similar technologies**

Our Site may collect personal information using the following types of cookies and similar technologies and process that data for the purposes set out below: 

Type of cookie

| 

Purpose   
  
---|---  
  
_Essential Cookies_

| 

These cookies and similar technologies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features (e.g. to keep you logged in as you navigate between web pages). Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.

These cookies and similar technologies collect personal information, such as unique IDs, IP addresses, device information, OS/browser type, and other similar data, that are used to create information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information.   
  
_Analytics and Performance Cookies_

| 

We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site.

For example, we use Google Analytics to improve how our Site works, so that we can understand usage patterns on the Site, and similar purposes. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies) and about how Google protects your data [here](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available [here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB). To learn more about other similar technologies we use and how you can opt out, you may contact us.  
  
  
_Social Media Cookies_

| 

These cookies and similar technologies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter. The social network will record that you have done this and may collect additional personal information about you, or link it to other personal information they hold about you, as described further by the social media service. Please see the applicable privacy policy for more detail.  
  
_Retargeting Interest-based Advertising_

| 

These cookies and similar technologies are used for “retargeting” and for interest-based advertising. 

Interest-based advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of personal data in connection with personalized advertising. These parties may collect personal information such as unique IDs, IP addresses, device information, OS/browser type, and other similar data, as well as information about the ads you see and view to develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to deliver more relevant advertisements and offers, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other preferences data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time. 

We also use ad “retargeting” so that you can see advertisements from us on other websites. For example, we may share with Google certain personal information (such as unique user ID) in connection with advertising provided through Google’s “[Customer Match](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6379332?hl=en&ref_topic=6296507)” service. These technologies and the data they process may be used by advertisers to deliver ads on their services based on content you have viewed on our Sites, or that we believe you would be interested in, for example, based on Events you have attended or products/services you have purchased from us. These tracking technologies may also help prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, and help us understand whether you have interacted with or viewed ads we’ve delivered to you. This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites (e.g. Google) that participate in the ad network, e.g. any advertisements delivered by that ad network on a third party website. 

To learn about the specific providers we use for these services, please contact us.   
  
## **To provide the Services you request**

If you use our Site, sign up for, or request to participate in a particular Service, we will process your personal information you give us or that we receive from relevant parties as necessary or appropriate for us to provide that Service. For example, we may process your personal information to:

  * operate, maintain, administer and improve our Site, e.g. to show the content you request, secure the Site, and understand how users interact with the Site;
  * create, manage, and communicate with you regarding an account you may have on our Services, including by sending you service announcements, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages;

## **In connection with marketing communications**

We also may, from time to time, contact you about a particular offering that may be of interest to you based on publicly available information, or information obtained through the Techstars network, Events you’ve attended, or your participation in Techstars Services. You will have the ability to opt out of such communications. 

## **To document and promote Techstars and our events**

If we create any Event Recordings, we or our event sponsors or participants may use those Event Recordings (including any personal information therein) as part of our marketing and promotional activities. Further, we may also publish the Event Records, including personal information therein, in connection with our documentation of or publicity relating to those Events, for example, on the Techstars website or a relevant Event-specific page. We may seek your consent or a release from you in the event the nature of our processing requires such consent or release. However, in certain circumstances, we may process or publish certain video, images, etc. without your consent, such as when we publish on an Event page certain Event Recordings that include images of groups or crowds in attendance at an Event. 

## **For online advertising**

We use may use your personal information we collect from cookies and similar technologies in order to market certain products and services to you, such as Events you may be interested in. For example, if you attend an Event, we may use your personal data in connection with online advertising campaigns on Google, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. We, or our third party advertising partners, may combine this information in order to create profiles that are used to make more relevant profiles. You can control how these third parties use your data, and the ads you see on these platforms, using the tools described in the Your Rights and Choices section below.

## **With your consent**

We may use or share your personal information with your consent, such as when you: consent to participate in additional surveys on gender and race/ethnicity (where legally permissible), let us post your testimonials or endorsements on our Sites, instruct us to take a specific action with respect to your personal information, or opt into third party marketing communications.

Please note, in certain cases (such as in connection with our Diversity & Inclusion efforts), we may collect and share with parties you authorize, information about race, ethnic origin, religious beliefs, physical/mental health, sexual orientation, or other personal information that is classified as a “special category” of personal data under applicable law. You may revoke your consent to this processing at any time. Additional information regarding these programs, how your personal information will be shared, and the parties that may receive it, are available within program descriptions we provided at the time you agreed to participate in the program.

## **For compliance, fraud prevention and safety**

We use your personal information as we believe necessary or appropriate to (a) enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Service; (b) protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of you or others; and (c) protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity.

We may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, subject to limits under applicable law. For example, we may share aggregated or de-identified information with prospects, partners, or sponsors for business or research purposes, such as when we analyze and report on demographic trends to measure our objective of having healthy diversity ratios across our programs. 

If we process personal information in connection with our Services in a way not described in this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy will still apply generally (e.g. with respect to your rights and choices) unless otherwise stated when you provide it. 

Note that we may, without your consent, also process your personal information on certain public interest grounds. For example, we may process personal information as necessary to fulfil our legal obligations, to protect the vital interests of any individuals, or otherwise in the public interest. Please see the Data Sharing section for more information about how we disclose personal information in extraordinary circumstances.

For example, when you participate in an accelerator program, your personal information may be shared with the identified accelerator partners to organize and deliver the accelerator. Also, when you register for an event through our Services, your personal information may be shared with the Event organizers and sponsors in order to communicate with you about the Event.

The security of your personal information is important to us. We take a number of organizational, technical and physical measures designed to protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no security safeguards are 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

Our Site may contain links to other websites and services. These links are not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services, and are not responsible for their actions. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites you visit and services you use. 

We may make available on our Site, or link to, features that allow you to share information online (e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in file uploads, through events, etc.). Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. We have no control over, and take no responsibility for, the use, storage or dissemination of such publicly-disclosed personal information. By posting personal information online in public forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy we will post an updated version of the Privacy Policy on our Site.

We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Our Products and Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not intentionally gather personal information from visitors who are under the age of 13, without their parental or guardian’s consent.

**Cross-Border Data Transfer**

Whenever we transfer your personal information out of the EEA to countries not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of personal information protection, the transfer will be based on one of the following safeguards recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for personal information, where required by EU data protection legislation:

  * Contracts approved by the European Commission which impose data protection obligations on the parties to the transfer. For further details, see European Commission Model contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries.
  * Binding Corporate Rules that have been approved by the European Commission and deemed to ensure that a given processor or controller provides adequate protection of data.
  * For transfers to third parties in the United States, ensuring they participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework



Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of the EEA, including the then-current transfer basis used to authorize transfers to specific third parties.
