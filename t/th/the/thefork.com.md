#####  8.2 _Modification of TheFork Site_

Given the interactivity of TheFork Site, all information it contains is subject to change at any time, without this engaging the responsibility of La Fourchette. 

#####  8.3 _Use of TheFork Site_

Due to the specific nature of the Internet, La Fourchette does not warrant uninterrupted access to TheFork Site or service continuity, the only obligation of La Fourchette being one of reasonable endeavours in this respect. 

La Fourchette shall not be liable for any failure to access TheFork Site or for any damage or loss arising out of the use or inability to use TheFork Site or its content, except as provided by law. 

La Fourchette does not warrant that the information displayed is detailed, complete, verified or accurate. The Restaurateur Content, information, restaurant pages and, in general, any content on TheFork Site are provided "as is" without any express or implied warranties of any kind whatsoever. 

Users expressly acknowledges that the photos on TheFork Site are not contractual. 

Users generally accept and acknowledge that the reservation with a restaurant is not guaranteed. Accordingly, La Fourchette does not guarantee the effectiveness of the reservation service. Availability is checked in real time via computer. However, as La Fourchette cannot physically verify the accuracy of the information collected and/or provided by the restaurants, Users agree that La Fourchette cannot be held liable if Users fail to benefit from the services of the restaurant. Indeed, the settings of the real-time reservation software depend partly on the information provided and/or recorded by the restaurant and may not correspond to reality. Thus, for example and without limitation, Users acknowledge and accept that La Fourchette is in no way liable if areservation is cancelled, the establishment is closed (for whatever reason), or where any third party refuses to provide any service, for any reason whatsoever. 

Similarly, Users accept that La Fourchette is in no way liable if Users fail to benefit from promotions or special offers proposed by a restaurant. Users acknowledge and accept that La Fourchette is in no way liable in the event that ta restaurant does not honour a promotion or a special offer for any reason whatsoever. 

#####  8.4 _Users warranties and indemnities_

Users warrant that they are fully familiar with the features and limitations of the internet. In particular, they acknowledge that it is impossible to guarantee that the data sent by Users over the internet will be fully secure. La Fourchette cannot be held responsible for any incidents which could arise from this transmission of data. 

Users agrees to indemnify La Fourchette against any liability, damage, expense, claim or cost, incurred by La Fourchette arising from any claim or dispute, in or out of court, in relation with the use of the services of La Fourchette, including the posting of User Content on TheFork Site by Users. 

In any case, Users explicitly acknowledge and agree to use TheFork Site at their own risk and under their sole responsibility. 

#####  8.5 _Notification and removal of illegal content_

Any Users may give notice of a claim or objection relating to illicit elements or content posted on TheFork Site. 

If a User believes elements or content posted on TheFork Site is illegal and/or in breach of their copyright, they must notify La Fourchette by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the "Legal Department" or by email to [contact@thefork.com](mailto:contact@thefork.com) stating "For the attention of the Legal Department" in the subject line and including all available evidence to support ownership of the rights, if any. Once this procedure has been followed, and after the accuracy of the notice has been checked, La Fourchette shall endeavour to promptly remove the illicit content. 

La Fourchette acts as an intermediary in the provision of its services to Users. Consequently and in accordance with Article 6 I.3 of French Law on Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN) of 21 June 2004 (as amended), La Fourchette cannot be held criminally liable for the information stored on TheFork Site if it did not have actual knowledge of the illegal activity or information (including User Content, Restaurateur Content, etc.) or if, as soon as it became aware, prompt action was taken to remove such information or block access to it.

####  **9. _Other provisions_**

##### 9.1 _Severability - Dissociation - Titles_

La Fourchette may proceed to draft a new clause with the effect of restoring the common will of the Parties as expressed in the initial clause, this in accordance with applicable law. 

The titles of the articles herein are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be considered an integral part of these Terms of Use. 

#####  9.2 _No waiver_

Except as may be otherwise provided in these Terms of Use, the failure or delay by La Fourchette in exercising any of its rights or remedy under the terms these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of the right or remedy or prevent any further exercising of the right or remedy. On the contrary, such right or remedy shall remain in full force and effect. 

#####  9.3 _Applicable law_

To the extent permitted by law, these Terms of Use and relationship between La Fourchette and Users are governed and interpreted in accordance with by French law. To the extent permitted by law, where these Terms of Use have been drafted or translated into other languages, only the French version of these Terms of Use shall prevail.

##  **PART 2. LOYALTY PROGRAM - SPECIAL CONDITIONS**

These Loyalty Program – Special Conditions complement Part 1: General Conditions of Use. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Part 2, Loyalty Program – Special Conditions and those of Part 1, General Conditions of Use, the provisions of this Part 2, Loyalty Program – Special Conditions shall prevail. 

#### **1. _Description of the Loyalty Program_**

The loyalty program allows Users to accumulate loyalty points ("Yums") after each reservation on TheFork Site that is duly honoured (the "Loyalty Program"). 

#### **2. _Participation in the Loyalty Program_**

Any User who holds an account on TheFork Site is eligible for the Loyalty Program. 

Participation in the Loyalty Program is free and automatic with each reservation on TheFork Site. 

#### **3. _Earning Yums_**

##### 3.1 _General conditions for earning Yums_

The Loyalty Program allows Users to accumulate loyalty points after each reservation on TheFork Site that is duly honoured, regardless of the restaurant reserved on TheFork Site and whether the reservation was made with or without promotional offer. 

For each reservation made on TheFork Site and duly honoured, Users obtain a pre-defined number of Yums (which may vary, depending in particular on the method of reservation: website, mobile or application) seven days after the date of the meal, regardless of the number of guest associated with the reservation and regardless of the country where the reservation was made. 

In the event that the reservation is cancelled by the User or if the User does not go to the restaurant and honour the reservation (no-show), the User does not earn Yums. 

The amount of Yums earned by each User is stored and can be accessed in the "[My Loyalty](https://www.thefork.com/my-account/loyalty)" section of the User account. 

#####  3.2 _Special conditions for earning Yums_

#####  3.2.1 _Special promotions with promotion code_

From time to time La Fourchette puts in place special promotions for a limited period during which Users may gain more Yums than usual (the "Special Promotion"). 

During each Special Promotion, Users receive an email specifying the conditions for earning extra Yums. One of these conditions is the obligation to enter a promotion when Users make their next reservation on TheFork Site (the "Promo Code"). 

The amount of Yums obtained through the Special Promotion is stored and can be accessed in the " [My Loyalty](https://www.thefork.com/my-account/loyalty)" section of the User account. 

When issued, the Promo Code has a validity period limited to the duration of the Special Promotion. The Promo Code has no monetary value and cannot be loaned, transferred or sold to anyone or used for any purpose other than those defined by La Fourchette in these Loyalty Program – Special Conditions. 

#### **4. _Using Yums_**

#####  4.1 _Loyalty Discount conversion_

Once obtained and after reservation on TheFork Site, Yums can be converted into a price discount deducted from the bill of a restaurant who is enrolled in the Loyalty Program (the "Loyalty Discount"). 

The chart for Yums conversion into a Loyalty Discount is available [here](https://www.thefork.com/my-account/loyalty). 

The list of Loyalty Program partner restaurants is available in the loyalty space of the User account on TheFork Site. Partner restaurants are also identified anywhere on TheFork Site with the Y symbol in a circle displayed after the name of the restaurant. 

To convert Yums into Loyalty Discount, Users must make a reservation at a Loyalty Program partner restaurant and tick the box "I spend my Yums to get a Loyalty Discount on the bill" before validating their reservation. 

That Loyalty Program partner restaurant is then responsible for automatically and without further formalities deducting the Loyalty Discount from the bill. 

If the amount of the Loyalty Discount is greater than the amount of the bill, the deduction made by the restaurant may not exceed the amount of the bill. In other words, the restaurant cannot pay the User the difference between the amount of the Loyalty Discount and the amount of the bill. 

In the event that there is a promotional offer applicable to the reservation, the restaurant will apply the promotional offer before the deduction of the Loyalty Discount. 

Yums earned by Users can be converted into Loyalty Discount until 31 December of the year following the year in which they were earned. By way of example, any Yums earned up to 31 December 2017 may be used until 31 December 2018. 

The Yums are strictly personal, have no monetary value and cannot be loaned, transferred, or sold to anyone or used for any purpose other than those defined by La Fourchette in these Loyalty Program – Special Conditions. 

#####  4.2 _Cancellation / no-show_

If a User has reserved with a Loyalty Discount and cancels the reservation, or if the restaurant cancels the reservation, the Yums converted to Loyalty Discount at the time of reservation will be re-credited to the User's account and may be used for a new reservation. 

If a User does not go to the restaurant (no-show), the Loyalty Discount and the Yums thus converted are lost and will not be re-credited to the User's account. 

#### **5. _Deletion of Yums_**

La Fourchette reserves the right to withhold or delete Yums obtained through the use of Promo Codes or Sponsorship Codes by any User where La Fourchette reasonably determines or believes that the use or redemption of the Promo Code or Sponsorship Code was fraudulent, illegal, made in error or in violation of the applicable Special promotion conditions or these Loyalty Program –Special Conditions.

Furthermore, failure by Users to comply with these Terms of Use (including failure to honour several reservations (no-shows)), any abuse or fraudulent use of TheFork Site and/or Yums, or any behaviour prejudicial to the interests of La Fourchette may result in the deactivation of the User's account and/or the immediate deletion of all or part of the Yums stored in the loyalty space of the User's account on TheFork Site, without prior notice or compensation. 

#### **6. _Modification/Suspension/closure of the Loyalty Program_**

La Fourchette reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Loyalty Program at any time without incurring any liability whatsoever. In this case, La Fourchette will inform Users by email and/or posting on TheFork Site indicating the new terms and conditions of the Loyalty Program and/or the terms of the closure of the Loyalty Program. 

#### **7. _Limitation of Responsibility_**

With respect to the Loyalty Program, La Fourchette is only oblige to use reasonable endeavours and accept liability only in relation to the attribution of Yums to the Users. Consequently, La Fourchette cannot be held liable for any claims relating to Yums after they have been duly attributed to a User by La Fourchette. More specifically, La Fourchette has no liability once Yums have been converted into a Loyalty Discount by a User. 

As such, La Fourchette is not responsible for any failure by the restaurant to apply the Loyalty Discount to the User. 

In any event, La Fourchette declines any responsibility in connection to the Loyalty Program in the event of contractual breach and/or fault of the User. 

## **PART 3. ONLINE PRE-AUTHORISATION RESERVATION SERVICE – SPECIAL CONDITIONS**

####  _TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE FOR THE ON-LINE PRE-AUTHORISATION RESERVATION SERVICE_

These Online Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service - Special Conditions complement TheFork’s General Conditions of Use and general conditions of sale of the concerned (the “Restaurant”). In the event of a discrepancy between these Online Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service - Special Conditions and those of either TheFork’s General Conditions of Use or the Restaurant’s General Conditions of Sale, the provisions of these Online Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service - Special Conditions shall prevail.

The Restaurant operates a pre-authorisation reservation service (the “Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service”) that allows Users to reserve a table at a given date and that allows the management of no-shows, late cancelation or amendments to the reservation by the User.

####  ** _ARTICLE 1 – DESCRIPTION OF THE PRE-AUTHORISATION RESERVATION SERVICE_**

The Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service, which will take Users’ bank card details, is provided by the Restaurant. Taking the card details allows the delivery of a debit pre-authorisation from the User's bank. 

The Restaurant has set a fixed charge per reserved cover for the bank card pre-authorisation. The amount is specified at the time of reservation. 

The pre-authorisation is not a prepayment for a User's meal. Payment for the User's meal will only be taken at the Restaurant. The Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service is just a guarantee for the Restaurant and no amount is debited at the time of reservation. 

Nevertheless, should a User fail to honour the reservation, make a late cancellation, or late amendment to the reservation, the appropriate sum will be debited from such User's bank account using the card details provided. The charge will be debited within seven days of the date of the meal. 

#### _**ARTICLE 2 – INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE PRE-AUTHORISATION RESERVATION SERVICE**_

For all reservations, the User will be required to provide the following information: 

  * Title; 

  * Surname; 

  * First name; 

  * Date of birth; 

  * Email address; 

  * Phone number; 

  * Name as it appears on payment card (compatible cards are VISA, MASTERCARD); 

  * Card number; 

  * Expiry date; 

  * Security number 




The entire pre-authorisation reservation process is secure (the form is hosted on a secure web page and banking security protocol). 

Supply of the information needed to use the Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service is mandatory. Users will not be able to reserve a table in the Restaurant without providing the requested data. 

**_ARTICLE 3 – FRAUD PREVENTION – BANK AUTHORISATION CAP THE RIGHT TO DECLINE THE USER'S RESERVATION_**

All pre-authorisation transactions made via the Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service are checked by a fraud-prevention system. This being considered, the Restaurant may have to block the pre-authorisation. The Restaurant reserves the right to cancel any reservation that is reasonably believed to be fraudulent, improper, or which involves any illicit activity, even if the fraud-prevention system does not block the pre-authorisation. 

It is also possible that pre-authorisation is refused by a User's banking institution because of a limit they may have set on such User's bank card, even if such User has sufficient funds in their account for the pre-authorisation reservation. 

#### **_ARTICLE 4 – CONFIRMATION OF THE USER'S RESERVATION_**

Once a User's reservation has been approved by the Restaurant such User will receive an email or text message summarising the details of their reservation (place, date, time, how many people in the party and the sum held in the pre-authorisation). The User will be invited to check the information in this message and to notify the Restaurant as soon as possible of any errors or omissions. 

In the event that a User does not receive a confirmation by email or SMS, such User is invited to contact the Restaurant as soon as possible to obtain their confirmation. 

#### **_ARTICLE 5 – TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR AMENDMENTS TO AND CANCELLATION OF THE USER'S RESERVATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRE-AUTHORISATION_**

If a User does not take up the reservation at the appropriate date and time, or 15 minutes after the User's reserved time at the latest, and has not cancelled in advance within the timeframe specified below, the sum corresponding to the pre-authorised amount, multiplied by the number of reserved covers (1 cover per person), will be debited from such User's account. 

**Users may cancel/ change their reservations up to 24 hours before their meal time.** After that time, the Restaurant will debit the User's account with the sum corresponding to the pre-authorised amount, multiplied by the number of reserved covers (1 cover per person). 

The concerned User will be notified of the charge and it will be debited from the User's account within seven days of the date of the no-show.

As the system is provided to the Restaurant by the company La Fourchette SAS, any debits to Users’ account on their bank statement will be listed under that company’s name. 

Users should be aware that amendments to reservations are subject to availability in the Restaurant. If the Restaurant cannot accommodate the reservation amendment due to a lack of availability, the Restaurant will propose that the User cancels the reservation. 

#### **_ARTICLE 6 – RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL_**

Pursuant to article L221-28, 12° of the French Consumer Code, Users have no right of withdrawal from catering services to be provided on a specified date or over a specified period. 

#### **_ARTICLE 7 LITIGATION MANAGEMENT_**

In the event of a dispute relating to the cancellation/ modification, or operation of the Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service and/or these Online Pre-Authorisation Reservation Service - Special Conditions, Users may contact the Restaurant or TheFork using the following contact address: [contact@thefork.com](mailto:contact@thefork.com).

11\. How to contact us

####  ** _1\. What information we collect from you_**

#####  _1.1 Overview_

We collect and store information that you provide us on our site or that you send to us by any other means. This includes information that may be used to identify you or contact you directly ("personal information"). 

If you contact us by phone, the conversations may be recorded. We use these recordings to improve the quality or compliance of our customer service, to verify the accuracy of the information you provide, to ensure prevention of fraud and to train our teams. We keep these recordings for as long as necessary, and then erase them. Your personal information collected during a call is processed in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy. 

Personal information includes the information that you provide us, notably your first and last name, telephone number, postal and electronic addresses, date of birth, password and payment information (credit card number, cardholder name, expiry date and security code). 

You can choose not to provide us with such personal information. However, in general you need to provide us with certain information about you to reserve a table in a restaurant, receive relevant offers from La Fourchette or the restaurants, and enjoy other benefits to which you have access as a registered user. In addition, certain information may also be required for you to be able to ask a question and allow us to answer it. 

Other information that we may need to collect also includes your IP address, identification and location data of your computer or mobile device, and your browsing history on our site, to the extent that this information concerns you. 

##### _1.2 Information about third parties_

If you make a reservation on behalf of a third party or invite guests via TheFork, you will need to enter their personal information. You must obtain the consent of such third parties before giving us their personal information. 

##### _1.3 Information from other sources_

We may also receive information about you from affiliated entities, our business partners and other independent third parties, which will be added to any other information collected about you. So, if you access our site by clicking on a link on a site belonging to one of our trading partners and you have registered with this partner, that partner may share with us information you have provided to it, such as your contact information and profile. Another example, if you use third-party services (such as social network services) from our site or before visiting our site, we may collect information such as your username, password and any other information made available to us through these services. We work with our current and future partners to improve and personalise your use of our site in accordance with the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

##### _1.4 Automatic collection of information_

We automatically collect certain information from your computer or mobile device when you visit our site. For example, we collect your session data, including your IP address, the navigation software used, and the reference site. We may also collect information about your online activity, such as viewed content, pages visited, searches and / or reservations made. We automatically collect this type of information to try to better understand the interests and preferences of our users and to better personalise their user experience. 

##### _1.5 Payment Information_

If you reserve a table in a restaurant that requires credit card details to secure the reservation, our payment service provider collects the payment information you provide, including your credit card number, expiration date, cardholder name and the security code. This payment information is encrypted and secure. Note that your payment information is processed by the payment service provider itself, and not by La Fourchette or the restaurant, who do not have access to it. The data relating to your credit card are retained by the payment service provider only for the completion of the transaction, and only for the time necessary for the management of any potential claims by the cardholders. 

##### _1.6 Geolocation and other information extracted from your mobile devices_

As soon as you use a TheFork application on your mobile device, we may collect and use your information, generally in the same manner and for the same purposes as when using our website. In addition, we may collect information about your location with your consent if your mobile device has been configured to send this type of information to the application (see your mobile device's privacy settings). We may use geolocation information collected by your mobile device to improve your experience when using the application by providing you with more relevant content. We can for example use this information to provide you with reviews about restaurants near you. You can change the privacy settings of your mobile device at any time and disable the functionality that shares your location information with the application. However, if you disable the sharing of geolocation information, this can affect some of the application's functions. For help with your mobile device's privacy settings, please contact the manufacturer of your mobile device. 

##### _1.7 Cookies and similar technologies_

We collect information via cookies and other similar technologies (invisible pixels). Cookies are small text files placed automatically on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site. Cookies and invisible pixels are stored by your internet browser. Cookies contain basic information about your use of the internet. Your browser resends these cookies to our site each time you visit it so that your computer or mobile device is recognised in order to personalise and enhance your browsing experience. 

You will find more details about cookies and similar technologies that we use (such as invisible pixels), in our [Cookie policy](https://www.thefork.com/cookie-policy). 

You will also find more information about cookies in general, including how to see what cookies are installed on your mobile device and how to manage and delete them on [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [ http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/ ](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/) . 

La Fourchette uses cookies on its site for the following general purposes: 

  * To identify your browser when you return to our site, to record and remember any preferences defined during your previous visit. For example, if you have registered on our site, cookies can allow us to keep your login information, so that you do not have to re-enter your connection information each time. 

  * To customise your browsing experience and the content on our site. For example, when you visit an internet page, we, our service providers or our partners automatically install a cookie in order to recognise your browser when you access the internet, and thus display information based on what appears to be of interest to you. 

  * To measure and document the effectiveness of different features, offers and electronic communications (by determining which emails you have opened and whether you clicked on a link in the email). 




The Settings option on the toolbar of most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to obtain notification when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies that are not useful to you. Please note that if you refuse cookies, you may not be able to access many of the tools offered by our site. 

Our site may also use web beacons (also called invisible GIFs or invisible pixels), which are tiny digital images with a unique identifier that work like cookies, and which are placed in the code of a webpage. We use them to understand the browsing patterns of our users who access one page from another page within our site in order to provide or transmit information to the cookies, but also to know if you are accessing our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third party site, and finally, to improve the performance of our site. We may also allow our service providers to use web beacons to help us determine which emails have been opened by their recipients and to track user traffic and actions on our site. We do this so we can better measure the relevance of our content and the effectiveness of our offers. 

_Data collected by business partners and ad networks to disseminate targeted advertisements_

We allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include advertising agencies that collect information about your interests when you view or interact with any of their advertisements on various websites. This information collected by these third parties is then used to predict your behaviour or preferences and to display targeted advertisements on third party sites. 

Note that we have no control or access to cookies and other technologies that third parties may use to collect information about your interests and their practices are not within the scope of this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which provides a single point of access to choose not to receive targeted advertisements from member companies. For more information, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). 

_Consideration of DNT (Do Not Track) signals_

Your Internet browser may transmit a "DNT" ("Do Not Track") signal to inform TheFork and other websites that you do not wish to be tracked. Due to the differences between the default configurations of internet browsers and the way they integrate DNT signals, site operators are not always clear whether users have actually selected the DNT parameter or whether they even know they can configure it. Please note that TheFork is unable to take DNT signals into account at this time.
