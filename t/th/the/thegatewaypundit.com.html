						<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
									

						<p>To help you understand how information submitted will be treated when you log on to and use our web site, The Gateway Pundit Online (www.TheGatewayPundit.com) offers this Privacy Policy. Use of the TheGatewayPundit.com web site, and disclosure to us of your personal information, is optional and voluntary. By visiting TheGatewayPundit.com, you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Policy. The following paragraphs describe the type of information TheGatewayPundit.com collects, the reasons why such information is collected, how such information is used and who has access to it.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL PRINCIPLES&nbsp;</strong><br>
TheGatewayPundit.com’s Privacy Policy may change from time to time without notice to you. You should read this Privacy Policy each time you plan to submit personally identifiable information so that you understand how the information you are submitting will be used.</p>
<p>Any changes made to the Privacy Policy will be prospective, not retroactive.</p>
<p>TheGatewayPundit.com is not responsible for the information practices of third parties, although we take care to engage third party fulfillment processors, ad servers, survey companies and other support services that respect your privacy, preferences and data security needs.<br>
COLLECTION OF INFORMATION&nbsp;<br>
TheGatewayPundit.com collects information that is provided voluntarily by visitors to our site. Certain identifying information, such as name, street address, city, state, zip code and email address, is gathered at certain interactive areas on the site, such as when you subscribe to our print or digital publication while online.</p>
<p><strong>SUBSCRIPTIONS&nbsp;</strong><br>
You may use the web site to subscribe to the print or digital version of&nbsp;The Gateway Pundit&nbsp;by following the instructions for subscribing.<br>
SURVEYS&nbsp;<br>
From time to time TheGatewayPundit.com conducts voluntary user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers for various purposes including promotions, contests and offers. We never share any of this survey information about specific individuals with any third party.</p>
<p><strong>COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES&nbsp;</strong><br>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. TheGatewayPundit.com may use data contained in log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<p>We use advertising to help support our site. We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit&nbsp;networkadvertising.org.</p>
<p>Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geo-targeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED&nbsp;</strong><br>
TheGatewayPundit.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests. Because TheGatewayPundit.com does not track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked on a particular ad.</p>
<p>We also use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and do not like based on traffic to those areas.</p>
<p><strong>CREDIT CARD INFORMATION</strong><br>
We comply with generally accepted industry standards in collecting and processing credit card information. However, TheGatewayPundit.com does not guarantee the safety of credit card information over the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION SHARING&nbsp;</strong><br>
When you visit TheGatewayPundit.com and are asked to provide information about yourself, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, you are sharing that information only with TheGatewayPundit.com. TheGatewayPundit.com will not disclose the information you submit, except with our third party fulfillment vendors and except as otherwise described here, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure to protect the rights or property of TheGatewayPundit.com, or for administrative or other purposes we deem necessary to maintain or service our products and services. For example, we may allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with our services.</p>
<p>If you do not want your data to be shared, you may choose not to permit the data to be collected or transferred by not submitting personally identifiable information on our site, or by not using a particular service.<br>
TheGatewayPundit.com SECURITY MEASURES&nbsp;<br>
TheGatewayPundit.com web site has technical and organizational security measures in place, including firewalls, to protect the information under our control from accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures do not guarantee prevention of loss, misuse, or alteration of information, however, so while we strive to protect your information, TheGatewayPundit.com cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY&nbsp;</strong><br>
TheGatewayPundit.com is intended for use by individuals over the age of 18. If you are under 18, please do not submit any personally identifiable information on our site. Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission to send any personal information online to anyone.<br>
OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY&nbsp;<br>
Whenever you voluntarily disclose any information online in any forum, that information can be collected and used by others. In other words, if you post personal information online that may be accessed by the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. It is important to be responsible and careful whenever you are online.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATING, CORRECTING AND DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
Users who subscribe to our print or digital publication,&nbsp;The Gateway Pundit, may correct or change online their subscription information. Users may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems with updating information, or who have any questions about how our services work, may contact us at&nbsp;midwestjim@charter.net.</p>
<p>If you do not want your personally identifiable information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by letting us know by e-mailing, calling, or writing us (see addresses below). Similarly, please contact us at the same addresses if at any time you wish to review your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Currently, TheGatewayPundit.com does not offer users a means by which to completely delete personal information submitted while on this site.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION&nbsp;</strong><br>
By using this web site, you signify your assent to this policy statement regarding online privacy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our web site. Moreover, your continued use of this web site after we post changes to the Privacy Policy will mean that you accept those changes. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this web site, or your interaction with TheGatewayPundit.com, you may contact us via email at midwestjim@charter.net.</p>
