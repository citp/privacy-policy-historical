# Privacy Policy - Your Privacy Rights

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact The Nest Member Services by emailing [membersupport@thenest.com](mailto:membersupport@thenest.com) and writing "Privacy Policy" in the subject line. You may also write to The Nest Member Services at 195 Broadway, Floor 25, New York, NY 10007 or call (212) 219-8555.

As we describe below, we may share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes. You can elect for us not to do so by editing your privacy preferences in your member profile at http://global.thenest.com/join/EmailPreferences.aspx, or by emailing us at membersupport@thenest.com (please include your name, address, and email address).

### HOW WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION

The first thing to remember about privacy is that there is only so much information that any website can collect without your answering of specific questions. The Nest logs IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, and to examine overall traffic trends. (For example, IP addresses help us determine the percentage of people coming from various online gateways, such as Yahoo! or America Online.) This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes only. IP addresses are not linked to any personal information.

The Nest uses a cookie, a small data file stored on your computer, to customize portions of our site to your preferences. For example, The Nest uses a cookie to identify you as a Nest member and to make sure that only you have access to, for example, your own personal wedding budget and calendar. This way, you answer certain questions only once and not every time you participate in an activity or event. The cookie by itself doesn't tell us, or anyone else, who you are, what your email address is, or anything else personal. You provide that information when you register with The Nest, and only The Nest has access to that information. If you choose set up your browser to reject all cookies, please understand that you may be limited to some the areas or functionality within our site.

For more information on cookies, please see our [Cookie FAQ](http://www.thenest.com/global/faq.html).

You can browse The Nest and read our editorial content without registering or providing any personal information. However, in order to take advantage of our personalized services, you are required to provide us with information such as your name, email address, real-world address, wedding date, and role in the wedding. We collect similar information from users who choose to participate in our contests and promotional events. We always let you know before we collect any personal information from you.

### WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Information we collect from your membership helps us to improve our content, customize certain pages for you, and update you about The Nest. From time to time, The Nest does share names, postal addresses, email addresses, and other contact and/or demographic information with other pre-screened organizations that have specific product and service offers we think may be of interest to you. You may choose at any time to remove your name and contact information from these lists by editing your privacy preferences (see paragraph below) or by letting us know via email to [membersupport@thenest.com](mailto:membersupport@thenest.com) (please include your name, address, and email).

We are currently contracted with Tacoda, Inc., a third party, to track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of our visitors and customers. All data collected by Tacoda on behalf of our Web sites is owned by us. This information is used to help provide advertisers with more targeted advertising opportunities, which means that our users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. For more information about Tacoda’s privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to [www.tacoda.com/notice](http://www.tacoda.com/notice).

### CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR NEWSLETTER SUBSCRIPTION

You can access or update your personal information, including subscriptions to our email newsletters, at any time. To unsubscribe, you can follow the instructions on the bottom of each newsletter, edit your privacy preferences in your member profile at <http://www.thenest.com/join/memberprofile.aspx>. If you would like to deactivate you membership with The Nest, you should contact The Nest Member Services by emailing [membersupport@thenest.com](mailto:membersupport@thenest.com) and writing "Deactivate Membership" in the subject line. You may also write to The Nest Member Services at 195 Broadway, Floor 25, New York, NY 10007 or call (212) 219-8555.

### OTHER SITES

The Nest contains links to other websites. We cannot be responsible for their content or for private information that you may choose to share with them. Please note: Information you release directly to parties who provide services to The Nest, such as any vendors in The Nest Shop or other sites you encounter on the Internet (even sites that are co-branded with The Nest) may be subject to different rules of use or disclosure. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing personal information to third parties.

### OTHER SECURITY PROCEDURES

Your privacy is very important to us, but due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. Under certain circumstances, the government or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can disclose any information about you to private entities, law enforcement, or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.

Finally, we use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL) where appropriate. We also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a Member Services representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage requiring keys, photo ID key cards and biometric scans to access.

We hope this policy clarifies our procedures regarding your personal information. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email [security@thenest.com](mailto:security@thenest.com).

### LEGAL DISCLAIMER

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

### NOTICE OF CHANGES

If at some point in the future, there is a change to our information usage practices that affect your personally identifiable information, we will notify you by email of the relevant changes. At the time of this message, you will be able to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to [membersupport@thenest.com](mailto:membersupport@thenest.com). We will also post the changes in our privacy statement 30 days prior to a change. You should also check this posted privacy statement for changes.
