# TheServerSide.com - Privacy Policy

  


## What information does TheServerSide.com collect and how is it used?

TheServerSide.com collects optional data supplied by visitors to the Web site through registration, occasional opt-in forms, and surveys. 

Certain mandatory data required for registration, such as your email address, is kept strictly confidential and will never be revealed to any third parties without your explicit permission.

## How is our registration data used?

Some content on TheServerSide.com such as PDF downloads and also the ability to post/respond to messages require a user to be 'logged in' and therefore registered. 

Our site's registration process requests that users give us contact information (such as their name and email address), unique identifiers for authentication (such as username and password), and demographic information that pertains to their profession such as business industry and job function. 

We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user relevant information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners, but only to those who opt to receive it. These messages are approved and delivered by us, and we never allow email addresses or other contact information out of our control. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailing. The user's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary, for the administration of prizes, rewards, or to respond to customer service requests. Unique identifiers such as passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity. TheServerSide.com contains links to other sites and TheServerSide.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such cross-linked Web sites. 

## Opt-in announcement List Privacy Policy 

TheServerSide.com does not delegate the management of its mailing list to any third party; we manage our own mailing list and conduct mailouts using our own List Manager and in no way reveal your email address to third parties that may occasionally use this list to send out relevant promotions. 

TheServerSide.com maintains two separate mailing lists: 

**TheServerSide Connection** e-mail newsletter, your way to keep up with the latest technical articles, design patterns, important industry news, new features on TheServerside, and learning opportunities. 

**TheServerSide J2EE Marketplace** , an annnouncements list that will help you keep up with special vendor's announcements and offers, specific to the J2EE industry. 

Whether you want to receive these announcement lists is your choice; you should only receive those lists you affirmatively choose to. If you choose to receive a specific announcement list, you will receive commercial messages that are related to the topic of the list from independent third parties that have contracted with TheServerSide.com to send messages to the list. Personally identifiable information will not be used by TheServerSide.com for any purposes other than to deliver the e-mail announcements. You may stop the arrival of these announcement lists at any time by removing your e-mail address from the list under your 'My Profile' settings, by sending an email to [webmaster@theserverside.com](mailto:webmaster@theserverside.com) or by following the instructions on the e-mails you receive.
