Frank Medrano may also collect your Personal Information through clickstreaming (a technology that allows the Site to track the paths that you take as you access the Site, and as you use links to other sites), web beacons (small, graphic images that allows the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity), and Site traffic information – Frank Medrano monitors and analyses traffic information on the Site in order to determine which features and services are popular and useful to visitors, so that Frank Medrano can improve our services.

Lastly, our Site also seeks (as many websites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the Site's server to identify the computer when it visits again, in order to improve Site navigation. This cookie is not used to obtain Personal Information, and the information that is tracked is used for internal purposes only. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your web browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed.

**How we use your Personal Information**  
Your participation in any of these activities is voluntary and we will only use the personal information you provide for the purposes for which it was collected. For example, we may use the Personal Information we collect to: respond to your questions or comments; administer our promotions and the Site; fulfill your request, subscription or order; and/or otherwise provide or improve our products and services.
