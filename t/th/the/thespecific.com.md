### Security

We take precautions to protect your information. Personal information is stored in a secured manner and always sent via a secure internet channel. When you enter sensitive information, The Specific uses secure socket layer technology (SSL) to encrypt the transmission of that information. However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and The Specific cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from its systems will be completely secure. The Specific is not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the site by any users or third parties.

### IP Addresses

The Specific maintains internal logs for Internal Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer each time you access the Internet. Your IP address does not contain PII. The Specific collects IP addresses in order to conduct system administration, report aggregate information, conduct site analysis, and to detect improper use of the site.

We do not disclose information about you to nonaffiliated third parties, except as permitted by law. For example, we are permitted by law to share information about you to agents, contractors, or affiliates of ours, who help us operate the website, conduct our business, or help us complete a service you requested. All such partners are bound to keep your information confidential. In certain circumstances, we may share information about you if we believe in good faith, that state or federal law requires us to do so, such as to comply with an inquiry from law enforcement officials, when ordered by a court, or by other compulsory legal process. We may also share your information to investigate or prevent suspected illegal activities such as fraud.

### WEBSITE ACCESSIBILITY

We are working to improve the accessibility of content on our website. If you have difficulty reading or understanding the content, please call our office and we will assist you.

Below, you’ll find a few recommendations to help make your browsing experience more accessible:

### If you have trouble seeing web pages, the [US Social Security Administration offers these tips](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/) for optimizing your computer and browser to improve your online experience.

  * [Use your computer to read web pages out loud](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/browseAloud.html)
  * [Use the keyboard to navigate screens](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/keyboard_nav.html)
  * [Increase text size](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/textsize.html)
  * [Magnify your screen](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/magnifyscreen.html)
  * [Change background and text colors](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/changecolors.html)
  * [Make your mouse pointer more visible](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/mousepointer.html) (Windows only)



If you are looking for **mouse and keyboard alternatives** , speech recognition software may help you navigate web pages and online services. This software allows the user to move focus around a web page or application screen through voice controls.

### If you are deaf or hard of hearing, there are several accessibility features available to you.

### Volume Controls

Your computer, tablet, or mobile device has volume control features. Each video and audio service has its own additional volume controls. Try adjusting both your device’s volume controls and your media players’ volume controls to optimize your listening experience.

### Closed Captioning

Closed captioning provides a transcript for the audio track of a video presentation that is synchronized with the video and audio tracks. Captions are generally visually displayed over the video, which benefits people who are deaf and hard of hearing, and anyone who cannot hear the audio due to noisy environments. We do not currently have video content on our website. [Learn how to turn captioning on and off in YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/100078?hl=en).
