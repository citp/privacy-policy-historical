For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, some advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the BTR Services. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads based on your interests on other websites.
				<br><br>

				The Website also transmits non-personally identifiable Website usage information about visitors to the servers of reputable third parties. To do this, BTR uses Web Beacons in conjunction with cookies provided by our third-party ad server vendors.
				<br><br>
				
				The purpose is to recognize you, provide personalization, improve your shopping experience, save you time, help us understand where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there, as well as to target internet banner advertisements on other sites.

Our third party vendors use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. Through cookies BTR can customize the Website to your individual preferences in order to create a more personalized and convenient user experience.
				<br><br>

				For example, Google is one of the companies that serve advertisements for beyondtherack.com. The <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx" style="color:black; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">DoubleClick DART cookie</a> is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying AdSense ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a partner's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help better serve and manage ads on the Website and across the Web. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences" style="color:black; text-decoration:underline" target="_blank">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>.

				We also use Google conversion tracking to measure the conversion rate related to our Google AdWords campaigns. This allows Google to tell us how users find the Website using Google. To protect the user's privacy Google’s cookie is not personally-identifiable and expires in 30 days. If you want to disable conversion tracking cookies, you can set your browser to block cookies from the googleadservices.com domain.

We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
