<p>Onion, Inc., producer of <i>The Onion</i> and its related content and service sites, believes that electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a service, commercial, and entertainment medium. We know you're concerned about protecting your privacy online. At <i>The Onion</i>, we treat your personal information (especially payment information) with the highest standards of safety, security, and confidentiality.</p>

	
	<h3>Information Gathered</h3>
	<p>We don't collect personal information without your knowledge. We don't sell, rent, or give your personal information to unrelated third parties without your prior permission.</p>
	<p>This policy explains what information we collect about you and how we use that information. We also outline the choices you have.</p>
	
	<h3>The Onion Store and Onion Subscriptions</h3>
	<p>By shopping at store.theonion.com or subscribe.theonion.com, you accept the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>In order to ship products to you, we need to collect information about you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, home phone number and credit card information. We use your e-mail address as a login for the store, as well as a way to send you a confirmation of your order. If we have a question about your order, we may contact you by e-mail or by phone.

<p>There may be certain orders that we are unable to accept and must cancel. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Even after your receipt of an order confirmation, your order, or any portion thereof, may be declined by The Onion.  Some situations that may result in your order being canceled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is canceled after your credit card has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card in the amount of the charge.</p>
