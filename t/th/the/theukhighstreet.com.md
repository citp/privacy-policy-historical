Cookies are short text files which are stored on your computer when you visit a website.

In most cases they do not involve or use personal information in any way. Cookies cannot harm your computer. 

They are used extensively online; for example, to store your preferences, keep you logged on so you don't have to log on each time you visit a site, and to provide hopefully relevant advertising.
