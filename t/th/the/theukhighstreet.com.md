## COOKIES

### What are Cookies?

Cookies are short text files which are stored on your computer when you visit a website. They are generated on the sites that you visit as well as by third-parties that websites work with to manage key elements of their business (user functionality and advertising, for instance). In most cases they do not involve or use personal information in any way. Cookies cannot harm your computer. 

They are used extensively online; for example, to store your preferences, keep you logged on so you don't have to log on each time you visit a site, and to provide hopefully relevant advertising. 

To place an order from most of the sites in our directory you will need to have cookies enabled. 

They are not used to share personally identifiable information such as credit card details. 

If you would like to delete, restrict or block cookies, you can use your browser to do this. 

We're giving you this information as part of our initiative to comply with recent legislation, and to make sure we're honest and clear about your privacy when using our website.
