Your privacy is important to us and we have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, and share information we obtain through your use of the Site. This Privacy Policy does not govern our use of any information you provide to us when you call us, write to us, or communicate with us in any manner other than through the Site. Because the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside. BY USING THE SITE, YOU EXPLICITLY CONSENT TO SUCH USE OF YOUR INFORMATION AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. This Privacy Policy is effective as of June 1, 2010.</p><p><b>1. Information We Automatically Collect.</b></p><p>We automatically collect certain information to help us understand how our users use the Site (which we will refer to in this Privacy Policy collectively as "Usage Data"). For example, each time you visit the Site we may automatically collect your IP address, geographical location, browser and computer type, access time, the Web page from which you came, and the Web page(s) that you access during your visit. We also use cookies (which are small amounts of data sent from a web server to your browser that are stored on your computer’s hard drive) to keep track of your use of the Site, to validate your identity, to remember your password, and to improve the quality of the Site. In addition, third parties who place advertisements on the Site may also collect information through cookies to ensure that their advertising systems and technologies work properly, to track geographical locations of users for the purpose of targeting advertising and to allow them to track responses to their advertisements. Cookies<br> set by these third parties are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties.
