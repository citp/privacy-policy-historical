CONTESTS AND GIVEAWAYS  
The Roar may request information from users via contests and giveaways. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email) and other information. The Roar reserves the right to publish all information submitted for the contests and giveaways on its website. We will keep the user details anonymous if they are published.

LOG FILES  
The Roar uses IP addresses and email addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

SHARING  
The Roar may share aggregated demographic profiles with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

LINKS  
Both the The Roar newsletters and websites contain links to other sites. The Roar is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information directly collected by The Roar.

FACEBOOK  
If you use one of our Facebook applications, The Roar may collect your Facebook name as part of the automated process.

SECURITY  
The Roar takes every precaution to protect users’ information. Access to your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job.

NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES  
The Roar reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these terms and conditions at any time. Such changes and/or modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Please review the [terms and conditions](http://www.theroar.com.au/terms-and-conditions/) periodically. Continued use of any The Roar publication following the posting of changes and/or modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised terms and conditions.
