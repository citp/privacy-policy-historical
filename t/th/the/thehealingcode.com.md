The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (S 877) is a set of guidelines set forth by the government to help cut down on unwanted email solicitations. We applaud the government for taking action and will comply with the guidelines set forth as a legitimate commercial emailer. As such, we will make sure that anyone who opts-out from receiving our offers will be removed from our email list within a 10-day period. Also, we will work with 3rd party mailing partners to make sure that to the best of our knowledge, our opt-out list is also removed from their mailings when dealing with our offers. If you have given us your email address and have opted-out from our mailings, your address will be included in our "Suppression File" for this purpose. If you have any questions or concerns with this policy, please contact [Privacy@TheHealingCodes.com](mailto:Privacy@TheHealingCodes.com).
