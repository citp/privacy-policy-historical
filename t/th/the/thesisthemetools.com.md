# Privacy Policy | Thesis Theme Tools

### We're marking our one year anniversary with a complete redesign!   
Come celebrate with us as we look forward to another great year of stimulating and useful articles -- and of course, our new skins!

Thesis Theme Tools is very serious about protecting your privacy. In general, any information collected here is never sold, shared or divulged to anyone or any organization.  
Your email address in comments or email is not sold, shared or divulged to anyone or any organization, ever.  
Any personal information shared in “Contact” emails is kept strictly confidential, and is not shared or divulged to anyone or any organization, ever.  
This site will respect the legal requirements of the State of Georgia and the United States of America.

Some of our site tools and advertisers use “cookies,” which are small files stored on your computer. These cookies do not store any personal information whatsoever, so your privacy is not violated by their use. 

For example, Google Analytics, which helps me determine the effectiveness of this site, uses cookies to tell whether you are a first-time or returning reader. The only information in the cookie is whether you have visited Thesis Theme Tools before. It does not identify you or your computer, and is completely anonymous.

If you do not want cookies stored on your computer, you may change your browser settings to refuse them. 

If you have any questions concerning our privacy policies, please email me using the “Contact” tab at the top of each page.
