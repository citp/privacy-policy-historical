# Privacy Policy :: Official Web Site of The Secret and The Power

The Secret's Customer Privacy Policy covers the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by Prime Time US Inc. ("The Secret" or "us" or "we") anytime you interact with The Secret or visit our website. Please take a moment to read the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is a priority at The Secret, and we go to great lengths to protect it. 

The Secret reserves the right to update this privacy policy from time to time.

Why We Collect Personal Information

We collect your personal information because it helps us deliver a superior experience and level of customer service. It enables us to give you convenient access to our products and services and focus on categories of greatest interest to you. In addition, your personal information helps us keep you posted on the latest product and other announcements, special offers, and events that you might like to hear about. 

What Information We Collect and How We May Use It

There are a number of situations in which your personal information may help us give you better products. For example:

  


  * We may ask for your personal information when you're registering for a service or purchasing a product.
  * When you interact with The Secret or our website, we may collect personal information relevant to the situation, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and contact preferences; your credit card information and information about The Secret or other products you own; and information relating to a support or service issue. 
  * We collect information regarding customer activities on our website. This helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites, products, and Internet services are of most interest to them. 
  * We may use personal information to provide products that you have requested as well as for auditing, research, and analysis to improve the products offered on our website.



Publicly Displayed Information is Public

If you use a story submission feature or bulletin board or chat room on The Secret website you should be aware that any information you share may be visible to other users. Personally identifiable information you submit in this manner can be read, collected, or used by other individuals to send you unsolicited messages. The Secret is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this manner. For example, if you submit a story that includes information, that was previously non-public, The Secret will collect that information from your interaction and the information may become publicly available. 

When We Disclose Your Information

The Secret takes your privacy very seriously. The Secret does not sell or rent your contact information to other marketers. 

To help us provide superior service, your personal information may be shared with the holder of the copyrights to the website and to the products sold on it, including The Secret book and film, who will take steps to safeguard it in accordance with our privacy policy. 

There are also times when The Secret makes certain personal information about you available to companies with whom The Secret has a strategic relationship or that provide products and services to you on our behalf. These companies may help us process information, extend credit, fulfill customer orders, deliver products to you, manage and enhance customer data, provide customer service, assess your interest in our products and services, or conduct customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are also obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with The Secret's policies, except if we inform you otherwise at the time of collection. Without such information being made available, it would be difficult for you to purchase products, have products delivered to you, receive customer service, provide us feedback to improve our products and services, or access certain services, offers, and content on the website. 

At times we may be required by law or litigation to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary. 

How We Protect Your Personal Information

The Secret takes precautions - including administrative, technical, and physical measures - to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

To make purchases from The Secret Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Safari, Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. Doing so protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it's transmitted over the Internet. 

Cookies and Other Technologies

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, The Secret's website uses "cookies" and other technologies to help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We may use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on our website. This information helps us make the website even more rewarding and helps us study the effectiveness of our customer communications. We also use cookies to customize your experience and provide greater convenience each time you interact with us. For example, your contact information and information about your computer helps us provide you with customer service. 

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. The Secret will not use this type of collected information to market directly to that person. 

In some of the email messages from us or those whose products are available on our website, we use a "click-through URL" linked to content on The Secret website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. We may track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.
