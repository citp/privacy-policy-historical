  This Privacy Policy describes the information that Score Media Ventures Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>"
  or "<strong>us</strong>") collect through websites that we operate and any mobile application of ours (each, an "<strong>App</strong>") (collectively,
  the "<strong>Service</strong>"), how we use, disclose and protect your information and the choices you can make about your information.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">1. CONSENT</h2>
<p>
  By accessing the Service, you expressly consent to the collection, use, disclosure and storage of your information and other information received by us as a
  result of such use in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use (<a href="https://www.thescore.com/pages/terms">https://www.thescore.com/pages/terms</a>) or your consent, and as
  permitted or required by applicable law. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, you should immediately stop using
  or accessing the Service. Please note that the Service may be hosted in countries other than yours, including the United States. By accessing the Service,
  you expressly consent to the transfer of your information outside of your home country, which may provide for different data protection rules than in your
  country. We make use of third-party service providers, including service providers located in Canada, the United States and the European Union to store and
  process data, including your information, on our behalf. When acting on our behalf, such service providers are only authorized to collect, use, disclose or
  store personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. However, the government, courts, law enforcement, security, or regulatory agencies of a particular
  country may be able to obtain access to or disclosure of personal information as permitted by the laws of that country.
</p>
<p>
  Any questions in this regard may be directed to the Privacy Compliance Officer using the contact information provided below.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">2. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</h2>
<p>
  We collect the following types of information as follows:
</p>
<p>
  <strong> a. Information you provide us directly:</strong> We may ask for certain information, such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone number,
  password (collectively “<strong>Personal Information</strong>”), and other information, from you in order to provide the Service to you, or if you contact or
  interact with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may retain other information you voluntarily provide us with, including but
  not limited to your comments and other content. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service,
  and as further detailed below.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>b. Information we may collect and/or receive from third parties:</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties including third party social
  networking services. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third party websites and services before linking or connecting
  them to the Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. We also may collect
  information about you from third party business partners, publicly available sources and our subsidiaries and affiliates.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>c. Analytics information.</strong> We may directly collect information, or we or our third party business partners may use analytics tools to help us
  measure traffic and usage trends for the Service (“<strong>Analytics Information</strong>”). Please review our Analytics and Advertising Tracking notice
  (<a href="http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences">http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences</a>) for
  additional information about how you can manage preferences regarding Analytics Information.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>d. Cookies information:</strong> When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
  characters — to your device that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service
  (“<strong>Cookie</strong>”). A Cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and
  other actions you take on the Service), and allow us and/or our third party business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent
  Cookie remains on your device after you close your browser. Persistent Cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent
  Cookies can be removed by following your browser's directions. A session Cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can set your
  browser to refuse certain Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability
  to accept Cookies is limited or disabled.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>e. Log file information:</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page or other content
  within the Service. We may also receive log information relating to your use of our Apps. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain
  log file information (“<strong>Server Logs</strong>”). These Server Logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP)
  address, operating system, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing
  pages, pages viewed, and other such information. The information contained in Server Logs is used to monitor, assess, manage, diagnose problems with, improve
  and otherwise administer the Service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>f. Clear gifs/web beacons information:</strong> “<strong>Clear Gifs</strong>” (also known as web beacons) are used to anonymously track the online
  usage patterns of our users. We also may use Clear Gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by
  recipients. You can disable the ability of Clear Gifs to track certain information by setting your browser to refuse certain Cookies. The information allows
  for more accurate reporting, monitoring and improvement of the Service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>g. Device identifiers:</strong> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart phones or tablets), we
  and/or our third party business partners may access, assign, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more unique device-specific identifiers, such as
  a universally unique identifier (UUID) (“<strong>Unique Identifiers</strong>”). Unique Identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored
  on and/or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A Unique Identifier may be data stored in connection with the
  device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A Unique Identifier
  may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A Unique Identifier may also be used to help you log in faster and enhance your
  navigation through the Service.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>h. Advertising identifiers:</strong> Advertising identifiers are unique strings associated with your mobile device provided by the operating system
  (“<strong>Advertising Identifiers</strong>”). Please visit our Analytics and Advertising Tracking notice
  (<a href="http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences">http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences</a>) for
  additional information about how you can reset Advertising Identifiers and limit advertising tracking.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>i. Location data:</strong> When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store location
  data, which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device
  (“<strong>Location Data</strong>”). Location Data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Location Data may be used to
  personalize and customize your experience when using the Service and to improve the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based
  services, may not function properly if use or availability of Location Data is impaired or disabled.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>j. Commercial and marketing communications:</strong> We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send
  you electronic messages containing Service-related notices (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, feature
  notifications, technical and security notices). We may also send you electronic messages containing product and/or service offerings, promotions,
  invitations and special offers. You can also stop receiving electronic messages (other than Service-related notices) from us by clicking on the
  "unsubscribe link" provided in such communications or by changing your account preferences or settings.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>k. Use of certain service type information we collect:</strong> We use or may use Cookies, Server Logs, Unique Identifiers, Advertising Identifiers,
  Location Data and Clear Gifs information to: (i) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit
  the Service; (ii) provide personalized content and information; (iii) provide and monitor the effectiveness of the Service; (iv) monitor aggregate metrics
  such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (v) diagnose or fix technology problems; (vi) help you efficiently access your information
  after you sign in; (vii) provide targeted advertising to your browser or device; (viii) automatically update our App on your mobile devices; (ix) allow you
  to comment on or provide content and participate in contests, special offers and/or promotions; and (x) conduct research, beta testing or surveys.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>l. With consent:</strong> We may use your information for any other purpose for which you consent.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>m.  Combining information we collect:</strong> We may combine any of the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">3. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  <strong>a. Who we may share your information with:</strong> We may share your information with third party business partners that function on our behalf.
  Examples include, but are not limited to, companies that assist us with serving advertisement within the Service, analyzing data, and providing marketing
  assistance. We may share information about you that they need to perform their functions. We will use contractual or other means to protect personal
  information disclosed to such third parties. We may also share your information with any subsidiary or affiliate of ours for purposes consistent with this
  Privacy Policy. Any subsidiary or affiliate of ours will be required to maintain that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>b. Who you may choose to share Your Content with; removal of content:</strong> Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting
  to the Service, such as Your Content (as defined in the Terms of Use at <a href="http://www.thescore.com/pages/terms">http://www.thescore.com/pages/terms</a>),
  becomes available to the public, except as limited by any privacy settings made available on the Service. Subject to your privacy settings, any of Your Content
  that you voluntarily make public may be searchable by others. If you remove information or content that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable
  in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information or content. If you are a California resident under age 18
  and a registered user of the Service, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the Service by emailing us at
  <a class="txt-highlight" href="mailto:privacy@thescore.com">privacy@thescore.com</a>. Please note that such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive
  removal of the content or information posted (for example, your content or information may remain visible because it was copied and posted or reposted by a third party).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>c. What happens in the event of a business change:</strong> If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture,
  securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or other transaction or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business
  otherwise changes, we may share or transfer your information to a third party or parties in connection therewith.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>d. Instances where we are required to share your information:</strong> Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent
  permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the Terms of Use or any applicable end
  user license agreement; (ii) comply with law, in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process or cooperate with
  government or law enforcement officials or private parties; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety and property, or that of our users or others; (iv)
  protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; and/or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding
  suspected illegal activities, suspected fraud, the rights, reputation, safety or property of us, users or others, violation of the Terms of Use, our policies
  or agreements or as otherwise required by law.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>e. Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:</strong> We may share certain service type information, including information obtained
  through tools such as Cookies, Server Logs, Unique Identifiers, Advertising Identifiers, Location Data and Clear Gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit
  pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with our third party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on "How We Collect
  and Use Information." We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics (such as your name and email address) and may
  share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>f. Ads on the Service:</strong> We may also share certain information and data, such as Location Data, browser and Cookie data, Unique Identifier data,
  Advertising Identifier data and other data relating to your use of our Service, with our business partners to deliver advertisements ("<strong>ads</strong>") that may be of
  interest to you. We may allow third party advertisers, including but not limited to direct advertisers, ad networks, ad exchanges, and private advertising
  marketplaces (collectively “<strong>Advertisers</strong>”), to serve advertisements on the Service. These Advertisers use technology to send, directly to your
  browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your Internet Protocol (IP) address when they do so.
  They may also use other technologies (such as Cookies, JavaScript, Unique Identifiers, Advertising Identifiers, Location Data, and Clear Gifs) to compile information
  about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on or off the Service and between multiple platforms such as your computer and your mobile device, measure
  the effectiveness of their ads, and personalize the advertising content to your interests. You can opt out of receiving certain Cookies by adjusting your browser
  settings to refuse certain Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed. Your browser settings may not permit you to block the use of certain non-Cookie technologies,
  and those browser settings that block Cookies may have no effect on such techniques. You may also reset Advertising Identifiers and limit advertising tracking (See
  "Your Choices About Your Information"&nbsp;below).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>We do not sell, rent, or share Personal Information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with third party Advertisers for their own
  marketing purposes, unless you choose in advance to have such information shared for this purpose.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Please note that Advertisers may ask us to show an ad to a certain audience of users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, we may (i)
  determine the target audience and serve the ads to that audience, or (ii) provide certain data as described above to the Advertisers to enable them to serve the ads
  to the target audience. If you respond to such an ad, the Advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>g. Data Analysis:</strong> We may use third-party data analysis service providers to collect data and to provide information to us on the performance of our
  Service. These companies may use information about your use of the Service and other websites and mobile applications to compare information about the performance
  of our Service. These companies do not use personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address or telephone number) when performing data
  analysis. These companies may also use non-Cookie technologies to recognize your computer, browser or mobile device and/or to collect and record information about
  your browsing activity, including your activities on or off the Service and between multiple platforms such as your computer and your mobile device. Please keep in
  mind that your browser settings may not permit you to block the use of these non-Cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block Cookies may have no effect
  on such techniques. Please visit our Analytics and Advertising Tracking notice at
  <a href="http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences">http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences</a>&nbsp;for more information.
