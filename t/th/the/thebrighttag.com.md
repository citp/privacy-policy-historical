## Information We Collect

### Information about you

In general, you can visit our Website without providing us with any “ **Personal Information** ” (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your name, mailing address, email address, or phone number). However, you may choose to submit Personal Information through our Website, and we may request other information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., your age, gender, ZIP code or similar information), payment information, information about your employer, and your preferences or interests. If we combine these types of other information about you with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Website Privacy Policy.

You should know that we also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through our Website, we will treat the combined information as described in this Website Privacy Policy.

Our Website is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we learn that we have in fact collected Personal Information from a user under 13, we will delete it.

### Information about your visit to our Website

As described below, we and our third party service providers may use certain technologies (such as cookies and Web beacons) that automatically or passively collect certain information regarding your use of our Website (“ **Usage Information** ”). Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Website, any search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to our Website, the areas within our Website that you visited, and the time of day you visited our Website, among other information. Usage Information also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (“ **Device Identifier** ”) for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access our Website.

## Use of Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Tracking Technologies

We and our third party service providers, including third party advertisers and analytics providers, may use the following or similar technologies to collect Usage Information whenever you visit our Website:

### Cookies

A “cookie” is a small data file that is transferred to and stored on your computer’s hard disk or similar device when you retrieve content from a Web server. Cookies may be stored on your device for different periods of time depending on how they are used. “Session cookies” store information that is only relevant for your current activity and are no longer accessible after you shut down your browser. “Persistent cookies” remain after you close your browser and may be accessed by your browser on subsequent visits. When you visit our Website, both session and persistent cookies may be transferred to your device. Certain Web browsers and certain browser add-ons such as Adobe Flash may provide additional data storage mechanisms that are used in a manner similar to cookies, and some of the content included on our Website may make use of this type of storage. For example, a Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html>. Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for a variety of purposes, e.g., to identify your device when you revisit our Website, to recall your authentication information, or to store information related to your navigation throughout our Website, or to enable certain features on our Website.

You may refuse to accept cookies, or remove cookies, by editing the privacy and security settings of your Web browser. For specific instructions on how to change privacy and security settings, consult the “Help” menu within your Web browser software. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Adobe Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the Website of its manufacturer.

You do not have to accept all cookies sent to you by our Website; however, depending on the particular cookie you reject, you may not be able to use some of the features of our Website.  


### Web beacons

We may also employ software technology known as “Web beacons” or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Website is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the Web pages you review or email messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Website, to monitor how users navigate the Website, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.

BrightTag Inc. (“ **BrightTag** ”) provides this Platform Privacy Policy to share with you how we treat personal information about you that we collect and receive in connection with providing our services to customers who license or otherwise use our technology and services (“clients”). If you would like to understand our privacy practices in connection with our Website and other services that BrightTag offers directly to visitors, please review our Website Privacy Policy.

Please read our full policy below but it is important to note that _**we do not collect any personal information on our own behalf – we collect information on behalf of our clients as service provider to those clients.**_ We only store, use and share information collected through our Services as directed by our clients on their behalf.

## Our Platform Management Service

We use our proprietary tag management technology to provide data processing services (the technology and services together, our “ **Services** ”) that enable our clients to manage and control the collection of data derived from their Websites, mobile applications, and other sources of data (collectively “ **Data Sources** ”) and its distribution to various third party marketing and technology partners.

Our tag management technology includes an integration library file, SDK, or API, which will be placed on or within a client’s Data Sources by the client or by us in accordance with the client’s instructions. If the client directs us to, we will set, read, and modify cookies or other stored content objects on the browsers of visitors to the client’s Data Sources. As a result, data pertaining to those visitors (“ **Client User Data** ”), which may include Personal Information, will be collected by us on behalf of the client. “ **Personal Information** ” includes information that identifies the user of a Data Source as a specific individual, such as the user’s name, mailing address, email address, or phone number.

## We’re Not Doing it for Ourselves, We’re Doing it for Our Clients

BrightTag does not have any relationship, contractual or otherwise, with visitors to its clients’ Data Sources. We act as a data processor on behalf of our clients and not as a data controller in relation to any data that is collected, stored, processed or distributed as part of our Services. This means that we do not use the information collected for ourselves, we just collect, store and act upon the data for our clients. Each client decides what types of information to collect and to which third parties to distribute that information. Then, using the client interface included in our technology, that client instructs us to collect, store, process, distribute, or otherwise act upon that information.

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. Our clients determine how they respond to any “Do Not Track” signal received and we follow their instructions in this regard when processing data on their behalf. Note, however, that there is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

Each of our clients is responsible for establishing and complying with its own Privacy Policy and for providing any required notice, obtaining any required consent, and offering and processing any applicable opt-out or similar choice option.  
Our clients may instruct us to process a variety of Client User Data including, for example:

  * IP address and other unique identifier for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the client’s Data Sources;
  * Information about a visitor’s Web browser and device;
  * Information about visitor interactions with the client’s Data Source, such as content viewed and products purchased;
  * Information that visitors have provided to the client, including Personal Information and information about personal interests;
  * Demographic data, such as age, gender and location; and
  * Data that identifies a visitor’s Web browser and device to one or more third-party services.



Some of our clients or the third parties to which our clients instruct us to distribute collected Client User Data may use our service to collect information, including Personal Information, about your online activities over time and across websites.

## How We Use the Information We Collect

We only use the information we collect for a client to provide services to that client. We may store and process the information and we may transfer the information to the client or to a third party at the client’s direction.

## Sharing Information with Third Parties

We will not share information we collect with anyone except the client for which we collect it, a third party at that client’s direction, or under the following limited circumstances:

  * Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf. Third parties who provide services to us may have access to Client User Data but only in order to perform the services we have hired them to provide.
  * Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may transfer and disclose information, including Client User Data, to third parties: (i) to respond to subpoenas or other legal processes or if in our opinion the disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; or (iii) to respond to an emergency or otherwise to protect the safety, rights, property or security of any person or entity.
  * Business Transfers. BrightTag may disclose and transfer Client User Data: (a) if we assign our rights regarding any of the information to a third party or (b) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, sale of certain of BrightTag’s ownership interests, assets, or both, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.



## Security

We take commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure Client User Data. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless connection, or electronic storage of data, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information we collect.
