## Our Services

Signal is a service provider. We license proprietary technology and provide data solutions to our clients. Our services include:

  * Integration of tracking tags and other code into client websites, mobile applications and other devices that allows clients and their various third-party marketing and technology partners to collect data relating to user interactions and interests;
  * Collection and distribution of data for the purposes of measuring the effectiveness of websites, mobile applications, advertising campaigns and interactions with other marketing channels;
  * Management and storage of de-identified data that allows our clients to recognize their customers across devices and platforms, to better understand their customers and to engage their customers with more targeted marketing messages



(the technology and services together, the “Services”).

## Data Signal Collects or Receives and Stores in Connection with the Services

Signal does not have any relationship, contractual or otherwise, with visitors to its clients’ Data Sources. In order to provide the Services to our clients, we collect data from our clients’ websites, mobile applications, advertising impressions, email campaigns, retail stores and other sources (collectively “ **Data Sources** ”).

The information we collect or that clients provide us about their customers we call “ **Client Data** “. “ **Personal Information** ” means information that identifies the user of a Data Source as a specific individual, such as the user’s name, mailing address, email address, or phone number or other information that identifies you as an actual person.

Client Data collected or provided in connection with certain Services (such as analytics), may include Personal Information but we do not use Personal Information in connection with any Services that assist clients with their interest-based advertising. Note that in providing the Services, we do not collect any Personal Information on our own behalf – we collect information on behalf of our clients as service provider to those clients. We only store, use and share Personal Information collected through our Services as directed by our clients on their behalf.

We do not use Personal Information in connection with advertising-related Services. For advertising related Services, we do use and store data that has been de-identified, which is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as a hash function) to convert information into a code that we cannot use to identify you directly. We combine this information with other de-identified information collected from or provided by other client Data Sources in order to help our clients recognize their customers and infer customer interests and preferences.

In order to provide the Services to our clients, we automatically collect certain information about your use of our client’s Data Sources when you visit or interact with those Data Sources (“ **Usage Data** ”). We collect a variety of Usage Data including, for example:

  * IP address and other unique identifier for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the client’s Data Sources (“ **device identifier** ”);
  * Information about a visitor’s Web browser and device;
  * Information about visitor interactions with the client’s Data Source, such as content viewed and products purchased;
  * Information regarding a user’s preferences and interests;
  * Demographic data, such as age and gender; and
  * Location information.



We consider the following “Sensitive Data,” and we do not use this Sensitive Data in connection with interest-based advertising Services:

  * racial or ethnic origin;
  * sexual preferences or practices;
  * criminal record;
  * health information;
  * genetic information that is not otherwise health information; or
  * biometric information or templates.



We further limit the collection and use of sensitive data as defined and required by applicable law in certain jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions define sensitive data to further include:

  * political opinions;
  * membership of a political association;
  * religious beliefs or affiliations;
  * philosophical beliefs;
  * membership of a professional or trade association;
  * membership of a trade union.



## Technologies Used to Collect Usage Data.

We use many technologies to collect Usage Data. Some examples include:

**_Cookies and Local Storage._** Cookies and local storage are data files placed within a browser on a device when it is used to visit a Data Source. Cookies and local storage can both be used to store a unique identifier for your device that can be used to recognize your device whenever you visit a client Data Source. Most browsers provide you with the ability to disable or decline cookies and local storage. You will need to check your browser’s settings for further information.

**_Web Beacons._** Web Beacons are small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) that are included in our clients’ Data Sources.

**_Embedded Scripts_**. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with a Data Source. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server, is active only while you are connected to the Data Source, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

**_SDKs and APIs_**. SDKS and APIs are programming codes that collect information about your interactions with a Data Source. This code is installed on a Device, typically within our clients’ applications that you choose to download onto your mobile device.

These technologies, and similar technologies we may use, and the information they collect may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking your visits to Data Sources, monitoring how you navigate a Data Source and determining your preferences and interests for the purposes of serving you targeted advertisements and other marketing messages.

Signal may receive Client Data through certain technology or services that clients license through affiliated services, including those offered by Signal Digital, Inc., if the client utilizes the services of both companies. We use all information we collect and receive in accordance with this policy.

## The Purposes for which We Collect, Hold, and Use Information

We collect, hold and use information collected or received in connection with the Services to provide the Services, to improve the Services, for our internal business purposes, and to meet any legal requirements or needs.

## Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

  * **Non-identifying data.** We may share non-identifying data, including aggregate statistics and de-identified data, with third parties.


  * **Client Data.** We may transfer Client Data and inferences about that Client Data to the client or to a third party at the client’s direction. We may share inferred interests and preferences with multiple clients and this information may be connected to your IP address, device identifier, or other information that our client has collected from you (including hashed Personal Information).


  * **Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf or on Behalf of Our Clients**. Third parties who provide services to us may have access to information, including Personal Information, in order to perform services for us or on behalf of our clients.


  * **Administrative and Legal Reasons**. We may transfer and disclose information, including Client Data, to third parties: (i) to respond to subpoenas or other legal processes or if in our opinion the disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; or (iii) to respond to an emergency or otherwise to protect the safety, rights, property or security of any person or entity.


  * **Business Transfers**. We may disclose and transfer Client Data: (a) if we assign our rights regarding any of the information to a third party or (b) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, sale of certain of Signal and/or its parent company ownership interests, assets, or both, bankruptcy or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.


  * **For other purposes**. We may transfer and disclose Client Data to other third parties as otherwise required by law.

You should know that we also may receive information (including Personal Information) about you from third parties. For example, if you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from Signal, that website will provide your contact and other information to us so that we may contact you as requested. Third parties may also provide information about you in connection with our Social Features. We may also supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through our Websites, we will treat the combined information as described in this Website Privacy Policy.

The information Signal collects in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy.

## Web Beacons

We may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Websites is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users.
