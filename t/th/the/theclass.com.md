As explained below, we collect information from you and other visitors and users (collectively, “you”, “your”, or “users”) of our website in various ways when you interact with our website (collectively, the “Site”), including, for example, registering for the Services, visiting or browsing through the Site for other purposes, or participating in or using any Service.  By using our Site and/or Services and providing any information to us through the same, you consent to our collection and use of information as explained in this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by our Terms of Use.

 **Collection of Information About You**

We collect non-personally identifiable information from you regarding your usage of our Site (“Non-Personally Identifiable Information”).  Non-Personally Identifiable Information may include, without limitation, website pages viewed in our Site, websites visited before coming to our Site, browser type, operating system, web pages clicked, time spent viewing pages on our Site, frequency of visits to our Site, connection speed, and your date(s) and time(s) of visits to the Site, and/or other information which does not specifically identify you.  We collect this information using various technologies (some of which are described below). We may use analytics programs and service providers, which can use first party cookies to report on your interactions with the Site. 

We also collect information from you when you interact with the Site in other ways, including but not limited to, registering for the Services.  For example, when you register for Services on the Site you will be voluntarily providing to us, through our vendor MINDBODY Inc., your first and last name, email address and postal or physical address, which is information that enables us to identify you personally (“Personally Identifiable Information”).

Please note that any Personally Identifiable Information or content that you voluntarily disclose in any potentially public areas of our Site becomes publicly available and can be viewed, collected, and/or used by other users of our Site.  You should therefore exercise caution before disclosing your Personally Identifiable Information via these public venues.

 **Use and/or Disclosure of Information About You**

We will use the information we obtain about you in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.  We will use information you provide to us, including Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, in connection with receiving email notifications from us.  We may also use your information, including Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, to better serve you and enhance your experience with the Site, among other things.  This may include having to modify or copy such Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, or other information such as images or textual content you provide, in order to provide you with a seamless and enjoyable user experience on our Site or Services.  Toward these ends, you consent to our use and disclosure of any such information submitted to us via the Site or Services, or information collected when you access the Site or Services in any manner.

We may disclose your information to certain business partners for the purpose of providing the Services or to send marketing emails to you.  We may also use your information: (1) to market our other products and services to you and other visitors; (2) to conduct research and analyze data to improve our Site, or Services; (3) to deliver email messages, updates, newsletters, service announcements, or to respond to inquiries; (4) to monitor and prevent fraud, diagnose problems, and estimate demographic information; (5) to enable our vendors and contractors to provide and assist us in the marketing, operation, troubleshooting and analysis of our Site and Services; (6) to comply with and meet any legal or regulatory requirements; (7) to protect our Site or its users; (8) to engage in any other lawful activities we believe are consistent with the foregoing; and (9) when required by law or to protect against legal liability.

We may provide or obtain any of the above services through third parties, which may necessitate sharing Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information with them.

We may also use and disclose Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information: to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity, fraud, or activities that threaten the integrity, functionality, or operation of our Site or Services; to protect and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of others; as required in any legal proceedings by courts, administrative agencies, or procedural rules; as required by federal or state laws; and in connection with a financing, sale, merger, or reorganization of our business or assets.  Any successor-in-interest to our business would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information, and may alter the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We do not and will not sell any of your Personally Identifiable Information to any third party for purposes of marketing, advertising, or soliciting.  We may, however, have to disclose your information, including Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, to other companies or entities in the event that our business may be sold or is sold to another company or entity.  In that case, your information, including Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Personally Identifiable Information, may be sold or transferred to such acquiring company or entity.

We may at times send you certain email communications, such as marketing or promotional emails, from which you may opt-out.  If you prefer not to receive such marketing or promotional e-mails from us, you may unsubscribe completely by selecting the “Opt-Out” or “Unsubscribe” link in the email containing the newsletter.  Please note that we will make reasonable efforts to process opt-out requests promptly, but, at times, the processing may take longer than that.  Please also note that at times we may need to send you e-mail communications that are transactional in nature such as service or announcements which are communications from which you will not be able to opt-out.

We are not responsible for removing, deleting, amending, retrieving, or modifying your Personally Identifiable Information from the lists of any Third Party Services or other third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

You may stop or restrict the placement of certain cookies, such as Google’s cookies and third party cookies, on your computer by adjusting your web browser preferences or a “Do Not Track” setting in your web browser.  If you do so, you may still use our Site, but this may interfere with some of its functionality such as your ability to automatically sign into the Site with a saved password.
