Users should be aware that if they access other websites, using the links provided, these are outside our control. If they provide personal data to other companies, the privacy polices of those companies determine the uses to which that information is put and The RSA's Privacy Policy will no longer apply.

## Security Policy

We recognise the concerns that many people have about giving personal information online. These are the measures that we take to secure your information from interception by a third party:

### How we secure your information to our web server?

All forms containing sensitive information, such as credit card details or bank details, are transmitted to our web server using a 'secure form' in which your details are encrypted using the most secure encryption level available.

### How we hold your information on our web server

All data is stored on hosted platforms which are secured to ISO27001 standards. Additionally we have an internal security policy to safeguard your data. Credit card and data deemed sensitive under the Data Protection Act 1998 is treated separately and is segregated from our general data records database.

### Who can you contact with a question about our security policy?
