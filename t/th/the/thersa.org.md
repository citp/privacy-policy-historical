_We monitor for, and try to prevent, security breaches. Please use the security features available through our online tools._

_We are not responsible for the content of third parties including any personal data contained._

_We store and use your data outside your country._

_Our statements regarding direct marketing._

_We target our communications using profiling based on the information we know about you._

**Security**

We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.

**Content provided by Third Parties published on our website**

We often publish and link to reports, blogs and articles written by Fellows and others who are not members of staff at the RSA. We are not responsible for the accuracy of either the content or any personal data contained within such content.

**Cross-Border Data Transfers**

We process data both inside and outside of the United Kingdom. Where we transfer data we do so either within the EEA, under EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks or through written contract terms.

**Direct Marketing**

We currently do not share personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

**Profiling**

Profiling is a common technique used in direct marketing and involves analysing data to improve the targeting of communications. The RSA uses profiling techniques to help ensure our communications are relevant.  Profiling allows us to target our resources effectively, which donors consistently tell us is a key priority for them. It enables us to raise more funds, sooner, and more cost-effectively, than we otherwise would. The data may have been provided to the RSA by our supporters when responding to our marketing campaigns, or when using our website, or social media sites such as Facebook. It may also have been provided by external organisations as described below.

 When building a profile we may analyse geographic, demographic and other information relating to you, as well as your previous responses to our marketing campaigns. We do this in order to determine whether we believe a particular marketing campaign might be of interest. Some of the data is provided by external organisations and may be provided at an aggregate level (e.g. by postcode). Where it relates to you as an individual we check that you have provided your express consent to the relevant third party for this use of your data. This helps to maximise the effectiveness of our campaigns and to minimise the wastage that would result from sending marketing information where it is not of interest.
