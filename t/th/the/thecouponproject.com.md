# Privacy Policy

This policy is valid from 20 April 2010

Maintaining your privacy is important to me, and it should be to you, too.  This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) outlines how and what information is collected and used by The Coupon Project and its affiliates.  Rest assured, I will never give or sell any information obtained by you on this site to a third-party without your express permission.  Please understand that information you voluntarily post on this site (such as your name, email address, or other personally identifiable information) is at your own risk and not protected under this Policy.
