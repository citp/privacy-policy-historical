The Department for Work and Pensions email facilities are a way of making general enquiries. The Department regrets that it cannot enter into long exchanges with individuals by email as this is not a secure way of sending personal information.

However, if you contact us by email and we cannot reply in the same way, we will reply by other means like the telephone or by post.
