# PRIVACY POLICY | Newtek Business Services ::..

**Dear The Small Business Authority Customer,**

We know that your privacy is important to you. At The Small Business Authority, we are committed to protecting it.

**Protecting your privacy is a priority to us.** The Small Business Authority does not share nonpublic information about you with third-party marketers outside Newtek family of companies — those related to us by some form of common control or ownership — without your consent, except as explained in our Privacy Policy. We do share customer information within Newtek family.

**The security of your information is a priority to us.** We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply fully with current federal law and standards to protect customer information. In addition, in those states where applicable laws are more restrictive than our Privacy Policy, we will restrict our sharing of your information to comply with those state laws.

**And, we want to make sure you know how we protect your privacy.** If you have questions about our Privacy Policy, please [Contact Us](http://www.thesba.com/the-small-business-authority/the-small-business-authority-powered-by-newtek-business-services-inc/).

Thank you for doing business with The Small Business Authority.

This information includes, but is not limited to, your name, postal address as well as e-mail address. The information obtained from the original registration is used to provide better services and products to meet the needs of our clients.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing Information Outside the Newtek Family of Companies**

Unless you authorize us to do so, Newtek and the Newtek companies do not provide non-public information about you to anyone to market their products and services except as provided for in this policy under sections titled “Sharing Information within the Newtek Family” and “Sharing Information with Newtek Alliance Members.”

If you are a consumer and not a business client, we will not share your non-public information with any third party other than our joint marketing partners or service providers without telling you and giving you a chance to say no. In some situations for business clients, however, we may provide the information we gather about you to third parties outside of the Newtek family of companies without your consent, subject to strict confidentiality requirements, as required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  * comply with any federal, state or industry standard or comply with legal process served on The Small Business Authority or a The Small Business Authority website;
  * to credit reporting agencies;
  * protect and defend the rights or property of The Small Business Authority and its websites
  * to protect against fraud, money laundering and other risks; or
  * act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Newtek, its Websites, or the public.



In addition, we may provide all the information we gather about you to our service providers and third parties referring you to us. These may include statement, billing, and telephone service companies, companies that help us perform marketing services as well as attorneys, insurers and third parties referring you to us.

**Sharing Information within the Newtek Family**

We also may share information about you within our family of companies serving small businesses. These companies include Newtek Small Business Finance, Newtek Merchant Solutions, Newtek Financial Information Systems, Newtek Tax Services, Newtek Insurance Agency, Newtek Data Storage, Newtek Web Hosting and other members of the Newtek family.

Since The Small Business Authority’s primary customer base is small businesses, by sharing this information The Small Business Authority can better understand your operational needs and develop products and services that fit those needs.

**Sharing Information with our Alliance Partners**

The Small Business Authority has many alliances with third party organizations and businesses to assist them in serving the financial needs of their small business clients. As an example, The Small Business Authority has an alliance agreement with a major credit union association to assist its 9,000 credit unions in bringing business services to their members.

When you are referred to us by one of these alliances, either directly or through an electronic connection that you have used in filing an application for a business service, we will share information about you with that specific alliance partner so that they may assess their success in reaching people or businesses such as you.

We do not share with our alliance partners personal consumer credit related information that is not public information but do share demographic information so that they may analyze the impact they are having on the small business community.

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information**

If you would like to verify and/or edit or update the personal information we have on file for you, please [Contact Us](http://www.thesba.com/the-small-business-authority/the-small-business-authority-powered-by-newtek-business-services-inc/) providing details on the information you would like to review and/or edit or update and contact information so that we can talk with you and get the information to you for review.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before providing such information or making requested corrections.

**Security Practices**

We have implemented and maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your non-public personal information. Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. Your personally-identifiable data is stored in our password-controlled servers with limited access.

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Links and Linked Internet Websites:**

Websites of the Newtek family of companies may provide links to sites that are separate from ours. These external sites may have their own privacy provisions in place that are different from those provisions listed in this document. Newtek and its affiliates are not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of information collected on these external sites and we expressly disclaim any and all liability related to any collection, disclosure or use of such information. In addition, we encourage visitors to seek out and read the privacy policies of any and all sites they visit on the internet.
