### Cookies

The Brick Fan uses cookies to enhance your experience of the site.

When you browse The Brick Fan, you may receive The Brick Fan cookies from TheBrickFan.com, and from 3rd party sites, such as Amazon, Rakuten, eBay, etc.

You can opt out of receiving some of the 3rd party cookies and information on how to do so is provided below.

### Affiliate Marketing Cookies

The Brick Fan is free to use but it costs time and money to run. The site is funded by affiliate marketing and cookies are necessary for this to function. When you click on links to Amazon, eBay and Shop@Home, for example, you may receive cookies that help the site remember that you’ve visited from The Brick Fan so that your activity (buying or bidding on things) is attributed to The Brick Fan, which then receives a small commission.

### Types of Cookies in Use

A session cookie, also called a transient cookie, is a cookie that is erased when the user closes the Web browser. The session cookie is stored in temporary memory and is not retained after the browser is closed. Session cookies do not collect information from the user’s computer. They typically will store information in the form of a session identification that does not personally identify the user.

A persistent cookie, also called a permanent cookie, or a stored cookie, is a cookie that is stored on a user’s hard drive until it expires (persistent cookies are set with expiration dates) or until the user deletes the cookie. Persistent cookies are used to collect identifying information about the user, such as Web surfing behavior or user preferences for a specific Web site.

Persistent cookies are created for analytical purposes, or in response to actions or choices you take at The Brick Fan and are saved so that, for example, your preferences are set the next time you visit the site.

The cookies created by The Brick Fan are split into two categories:

Analytical cookies allow us to recognise and to count the number of visitors to our website, to see how visitors move around the website when they are using it and to record which content viewers view and are interested in. This helps us to determine how frequently particular pages and advertisements are visited and to determine the most popular areas of our website. This helps us to improve the service which we offer to you by helping us make sure our users are finding the information they are looking for, by providing anonymised demographic data to third parties in order to target advertising more appropriately to you, and by tracking the success of advertising campaigns on our website.

Third party cookies are created by sites other than The Brick Fan and are used to support features such as advertising, affiliate marketing, and social bookmarking.
