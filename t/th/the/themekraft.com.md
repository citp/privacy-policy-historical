# Privacy Policy | Themekraft

**We respect your privacy, which is critically important to us. Our fundamental principles are:**

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates the following goals: 

[Themekraft](http://themekraft.com/) is an Open Source Community with the possibility to purchase Premium Products (Themes, Plugins, Services). It is Themekraft’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Themekraft collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Themekraft’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Themekraft’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Themekraft may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Themekraft also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on themekraft.com. Themekraft only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Themekraft’s websites choose to interact with Themekraft in ways that require Themekraft to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Themekraft gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at [themekraft.com](http://themekraft.com/) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Themekraft – by purchasing access to premium themes, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Themekraft collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Themekraft. Themekraft does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Themekraft may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, Themekraft does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Themekraft discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Themekraft’s behalf or to provide services available at Themekraft’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Themekraft’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Themekraft will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Themekraft discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Themekraft believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Themekraft, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Themekraft and have supplied your email address, Themekraft may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Themekraft and our products. We primarily use our website to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Themekraft takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Themekraft uses cookies to help Themekraft identify and track visitors, their usage of Themekraft website, and their website access preferences. Themekraft visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Themekraft’s website, with the drawback that certain features of Themekraft’s website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Themekraft and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Comments

Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Themekraft may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Themekraft’s sole discretion. Themekraft encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

### Note

[Automattic](http://automattic.com/ "Automattic") decided to make this privacy policy available under a **Creative Commons Sharealike** license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to replace references to WordPress with ones to you, and if you want they’d appreciate a link to WordPress.com somewhere on your site. They spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same.
