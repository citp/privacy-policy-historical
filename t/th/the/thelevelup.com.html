<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains to Users of the LevelUp website
(<a href="/">https://www.thelevelup.com/</a>), mobile applications offered by or powered by LevelUp,
microsites, software and service (collectively, the "Service"), how SCVNGR, Inc., doing
business as LevelUp ("LevelUp", "we" or "us"), gathers and uses information collected in
connection with use of the Service and the LevelUp platform. LevelUp takes reasonable steps
to protect User privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this Privacy Policy and
with all applicable laws. In this Privacy Policy, "User" or "you" means any person using the
Service, whether by browsing the LevelUp website or using LevelUp mobile apps, paying for
items and/or transactions using the LevelUp application, engaging in loyalty and rewards
programs ("Programs") offered by LevelUp merchants (each a "Merchant"), or participating in
any other activities available through the Service.
</p>
<p>
BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE AND/OR THE LEVELUP PLATFORM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE
READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR USER TERMS OF SERVICE
(<a href="/terms">https://www.thelevelup.com/terms</a>). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE
SERVICE.
</p>
<h2>2. First Up, We Want You to Know This:</h2>
<p>
You control your personal information on the LevelUp platform. We will never disclose your
email address, transaction history, or other information to any Merchant or any other third
party for their marketing purposes without you first authorizing that Merchant or third
party to access such information. This allows you to use the LevelUp Service and LevelUp
platform without receiving a whole lot of direct marketing you don't want.
</p>
<h2>3. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>
<span class="underline">Personal Information:</span>
LevelUp collects some of your identifying information in connection with the Service. When
you create a LevelUp User Account (whether through a LevelUp App or LevelUp website), pay
with LevelUp, engage in a Program, submit content to LevelUp, complete a survey, send us
feedback, request information about the Service, apply for a job, or sign up for special
offers from third parties, LevelUp may collect information from you, such as your email
address, first and last name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, location,
merchant transaction data (including the amount, date, and location of the transaction, the
amount of credit earned and redeemed, and the identity and amount of items purchased), and
some information related to your payment instruments, such as expiration date and
authentication codes or related information (collectively, "Personal Information"). You do
not have to provide Personal Information to LevelUp, but you may not be able to take
advantage of all features of the Service if you do not.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Financial Information.</span>
In order to use the Service and the LevelUp platform in connection with payments to
merchants, you will need to link a payment instrument to your LevelUp User Account
("Financial Information"). LevelUp will only collect this information using a secure,
transparent pass through to our third-party data vault and payment gateway provider, and
LevelUp will never store your payment information itself. LevelUp and its providers maintain
compliance with all laws and rules protecting the privacy of your financial information,
including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Web Tracking Information.</span>
LevelUp and its third party service providers may use web tracking technologies, such as
cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs, to collect data related to usage of the
Service, the Programs, and web and email marketing conducted by or on behalf of LevelUp.
Such data may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited
the Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what
pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on. In order to collect Web
Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more efficient, we may store
cookies on your computer. LevelUp and third party contractors engaged to provide services on
behalf of LevelUp ("Contractors") may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in
web pages on the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions
that users take when they interact with the Service or such email communications. Web
Tracking Information is not correlated by LevelUp to individual users. Some Web Tracking
Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be
able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted
when you use the Service, but this may affect the performance of the Service.
</p>
<h2>USA Patriot Act Notice to Merchants</h2>
<p>
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities,
federal law requires financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that
identifies each person who registers for a Merchant Account with LevelUp. Merchants will be
required to provide such information to the satisfaction of LevelUp prior to establishing a
Merchant Account.
</p>
<h2>How Does LevelUp Use the Information We Collect?</h2>
<p>
<span class="underline">Personal Information:</span>
LevelUp and its third party service providers may use web tracking technologies, such as
cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and clear GIFs, to collect data related to usage of the
Service, the Programs, and web and email marketing conducted by or on behalf of LevelUp.
Such data may include the address of the websites you visited before and after you visited
the Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, what
pages in the Service you visit and what links you clicked on. In order to collect Web
Tracking Information and to make your use of the Service more efficient, we may store
cookies on your computer. LevelUp and third party contractors engaged to provide services on
behalf of LevelUp ("Contractors") may also use web tracking technologies that are placed in
web pages on the Service or in email communications to collect information about actions
that users take when they interact with the Service or such email communications. Web
Tracking Information is not correlated by LevelUp to individual users. Some Web Tracking
Information may include data, such as IP address data, that is unique to you. You may be
able to modify your browser settings to alter which web tracking technologies are permitted
when you use the Service, but this may affect the performance of the Service.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Financial Information:</span>
We will only ever use your Financial Information for the purpose of submitting an authorized
charge to your payment instrument. Financial Information is never provided to LevelUp, and
is never disclosed to third parties, including LevelUp Merchants, other than LevelUp's vault
and payment gateway provider.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Aggregate Information:</span>
LevelUp may also use Personal Information to create aggregated data for analytical purposes.
This statistical information does not contain any individual identifying information or
contact information and is used to understand our customer base as a whole and to better
serve our market. LevelUp reserves the right to share such aggregated data with 3rd parties.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Web Tracking Information:</span>
LevelUp uses Web Tracking Information to administer the Service and to understand how well
our Service is working, and to develop aggregate, statistical information on usage of the
Services. This allows us to determine which features visitors like best to help us improve
our Service, personalize your user experience, and measure overall effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Email Communications:</span>
If you create a LevelUp User Account and provide your email address, we will send you
administrative and promotional emails concerning the LevelUp Service and LevelUp platform,
including new features, promotions, Programs, and rewards. If you wish to opt out of
promotional emails, you may do so by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in the email,
or by editing your LevelUp User Account settings as described below. All LevelUp Users
receive administrative emails. If you wish to opt out of administrative emails, you must
delete your account entirely and cease use of the Service.
</p>
<h2>What Information Do We Disclose to Third Parties?</h2>
<p>
<span class="underline">Personal Information:</span>
LevelUp does not sell or rent its mailing list, and we will not disclose your email address
to any third party for marketing purposes, unless you specifically authorize a third party
(such as a LevelUp Merchant) to access that information. LevelUp will disclose your Personal
Information to third parties only in the following limited circumstances:
</p>
<ul class="number-list">
<li>
<p>
When you use the LevelUp Service at a Merchant, LevelUp may disclose your name (first
name and last initial, but not your email address) to the associated Merchant to aid in
the utilization process and loyalty program tracking;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
LevelUp may allow our Contractors, who are performing marketing services, delivering
goods, administering promotions, analyzing data and usage of the Service, processing
credit card payments, operating the Service or providing support and maintenance
services for the Service, or providing customer service, to access Personal Information.
We require Contractors to use the Personal Information they access only in connection
with the services they perform for us, and never for any marketing or other purposes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
LevelUp may use Personal Information to investigate reports of fraud, and to correct any
issues associated therewith;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
LevelUp will permit access to your Personal Information by a Merchant or third-party
that you specifically authorize to access your information, either by granting a party's
request for permissions in your LevelUp App, or by downloading and logging into a
Merchant LevelUp App with your LevelUp credentials, which grants to the Merchant
providing the LevelUp App permission to access your Personal Information, including the
email address you use to log in, and your transaction history. You can revoke access
permissions granted to any Merchant or other third-party at any time by logging in to
the LevelUp website at: <a href="/login">https://www.thelevelup.com/login</a>; and,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you are a winner of a Merchant or LevelUp sponsored competition (as detailed in the
Applicable Contest Terms), we will share your contact information for purposes of prize
fulfillment only.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span class="underline">Web Tracking Information:</span>
LevelUp may disclose Web Tracking Information without individual identifying information, to
third party advertisers and advertising agencies, Merchants, and Contractors, in order for
LevelUp and such third parties to analyze the performance of the Services and the behavior
of users, to operate and improve the Service. We may also publish selected aggregated
information in order to promote the Service.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Aggregate Information:</span>
We may disclose anonymous, aggregated information to third parties such as potential
business partners, Merchants, advertisers, and funding sources, in order to describe our
business and operations.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Network Operators:</span>
Use of the Service may involve use of the services of third party telecommunications
carriers and service providers (such as the services of the carrier that provides cellphone
service to you). Such carriers and service providers are not LevelUp's Contractors, and any
information that a carrier collects in connection with your use of the Service is not
Personal Information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. LevelUp is not responsible
for the acts or omissions of telecommunications carriers or service providers.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Additional Disclosures:</span>
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, LevelUp reserves the right
to use or disclose Personal Information and any other information LevelUp collects in
connection with the Service: (a) to any successor to LevelUp's business, including as a
result of any merger, acquisition, asset sale or similar transaction; (b) to any law
enforcement, judicial authority, or governmental or regulatory authority, to the extent
required by law or legal process; or (c) if in LevelUp's reasonable discretion, such use or
disclosure is necessary to enforce or protect LevelUp's legal rights or to protect third
parties.
</p>
<h2>Privacy Settings/Opt Out</h2>
<p>
If you would like your Personal Information permanently removed from our database, please
contact us at <a href="mailto:support@thelevelup.com">support@thelevelup.com</a>. We will promptly disable your
LevelUp User Account and you will no longer receive email from LevelUp. Your removal from
the mailing list or database will not remove records of past transactions or delete
information stored in our data backups and archives as required by law. Data on past
transactions and data stored in backups and archives will be deleted in the normal course of
LevelUp's business.
</p>
<h2>Third-Party Apps</h2>
<p>
The LevelUp platform enables any third-party to develop applications, software, and websites
that can access the LevelUp platform on your behalf, with your permission. You may also be
offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties as part of your use of
any LevelUp App.
</p>
<p>
Third-party LevelUp Apps interfacing with the LevelUp platform are required to be operated
in accordance with LevelUp's
<a href="/merchant-terms">Terms of Service for Merchants</a>,
<a href="/developer-terms">Terms of Service for Developers</a>, and this Privacy
Policy, but they are not under the control of LevelUp, and LevelUp is not responsible for
the contents of any linked site or third party app or third party LevelUp App. You will be
responsible for reviewing and understanding any additional terms and conditions associated
with any third party app, LevelUp App, sites, or services. Please remember that once you
grant a third party or Merchant permission to access your personal information in the
LevelUp platform, or you use a link to go from a LevelUp App or website to another website,
LevelUp's Privacy Policy no longer applies, and you will then be subject to that Merchant's
or that website's own rules and policies. You should make whatever investigation you feel
necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any of these third
parties or granting permissions for any LevelUp App to access any of your Personal
Information. LevelUp is not responsible for any claims, liabilities, losses, or damages
suffered by you in connection with your use of a third party LevelUp App, site, or service,
in connection with the LevelUp platform.
</p>
<h2>Access and Updating of Information</h2>
<p>
LevelUp is happy to allow you to review or amend your email address or contact details in
the LevelUp platform at any time. Please contact us by sending an email to:
<a href="mailto:support@thelevelup.com">support@thelevelup.com</a> or by using your settings panel in your User Account
accessible at: <a href="/">https://www.thelevelup.com/</a>.
</p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>
<span class="underline">Facebook Connect:</span>
If you connect to the LevelUp Service using Facebook Connect, you agree that any identifying
information obtained by us by reason of your connection using Facebook Connect will
constitute Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, and you consent to
our use and disclosure of such information in accordance with this Policy. If we stop using
Facebook Connect as an access mechanism, you agree that we will nevertheless retain any
Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Security:</span>
We use reasonable security precautions to protect the security and integrity of your
Personal Information in accordance with this Policy and applicable law. However, no Internet
transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that security breaches will not
occur. Without limitation of the foregoing, we are not responsible for the actions of
hackers and other unauthorized third parties.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Amendments:</span>
LevelUp may modify or amend this policy from time to time. We will notify you of these
changes by posting the modified Privacy Policy, which will be available for review by you on
our website at <a href="/privacy">https://www.thelevelup.com/privacy</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Children:</span>
LevelUp does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from
persons under 13 years of age, and no part of the Service is directed at persons under 13.
If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use the Service. If LevelUp learns that
personally identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected
without verifiable parental consent, then LevelUp will take the appropriate steps to delete
this information. To make such a request, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:support@thelevelup.com">support@thelevelup.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="underline">Service Visitors from Outside the United States:</span>
LevelUp and its servers are located in the United States and are subject to the applicable
state and federal laws of the United States. If you choose to access or use the Service, you
consent to the use and disclosure of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and
subject to such laws.
</p>
<h2>Google Analytics for Display Advertisers</h2>
<p>
LevelUp uses remarketing to advertise across the internet. Along with the Google Analytics
cookie, the DoubleClick cookie is collected by Google Analytics based on your browsing
history. This optimizes your ad exposure to be more targeted to your interests throughout
the Google Display Network. This feature can be even more personalized, by letting you
customize which ads you see. LevelUp follows the Google AdWords Remarketing Policy, as well
as Google's restrictions for sensitive categories. If you decide that this isn't for you,
feel free to visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">this page</a> to opt out.
