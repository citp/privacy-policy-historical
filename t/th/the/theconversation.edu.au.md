# Privacy at The Conversation

Last updated: 14 Nov 2017

## 1\. Introduction

The Conversation Media Group Ltd ACN 142 923 653 is bound by the Australian Privacy Principles ( **APPs** ) set out in the _Privacy Act 1988_ (Cth) ( **Privacy Act** ).

This policy sets out how we handle Personal Information, including the Personal Information of our authors, commenters and readers ( **users** ), in accordance with the Privacy Act, and how you can exercise your rights under the Privacy Act.

We may amend this policy from time to time. At any time, the latest version of our Privacy Policy is available from our website at www.theconversation.com/au/privacypolicy.

We are a media organisation within the definition used in the Privacy Act. As such, for all our dealings with Personal Information in the course of journalism we may rely on the exemption contained in section 7B(4) of the Privacy Act.

## 2\. Definitions

‘ **Personal Information** ’ has the meaning set out in the Privacy Act. Essentially, Personal Information is information or an opinion about an individual who is reasonably identifiable (including names, addresses, birth dates, or email addresses).

‘ **Related Body Corporate** ’ has the same meaning as ‘Related Body Corporate’ under section 50 of the _Corporations Act 2001_ (Cth).

## 3\. How do we collect your Personal Information and what types of Personal Information do we collect?

We collect your Personal Information directly from you. The types of Personal Information we collect depends on the circumstances in which the information is collected. For example, we may collect Personal Information when you create an account for, or publish an article or comment on The Conversation, which may include:
