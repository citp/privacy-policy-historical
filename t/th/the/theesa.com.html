          <a name="1" id="1"></a>What information does this Privacy Statement cover?</h4>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to  personal information collected on the Web sites where this Privacy Policy is  posted (<a href="http://www.theesa.com">http://www.theesa.com</a>; <a href="http://www.jointhecteam.com" target="_blank">http://www.jointhecteam.com</a>; <a href="http://www.gameoverpirates.com" target="_blank">http://www.gameoverpirates.com</a>; and <a href="http://www.e3expo.com/" target="_blank">http://www.e3expo.com</a>), and does not apply to any other information collected by  ESA through any other means. </p>
        <p>          This Privacy Policy applies to the  use and sharing of personal information collected on and after the date that  this Privacy Policy is posted. </p>
        <p> Please note that this Privacy Policy  applies only to information submitted and collected online, and does not apply  to information that may be collected by ESA offline.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy  applies only to Web sites maintained by ESA, and not to our international  affiliates, or any web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to  which we link.&nbsp; ESA, therefore, is not responsible for the content or  activities provided on those web sites. </p>
        <p> Finally, the terms of this Privacy  Policy are subject to all applicable laws. </p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#container">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="2" id="2"></a>What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?</h4>
        <p>We don't require personal  information to access our Web sites.&nbsp; However, if you prefer not to  disclose personal information, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of  our Web site.&nbsp; Personal information is information that identifies you and  may be used to contact you.&nbsp; To offer our guests certain features on our  Web site, we may collect several types of personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p><em>Information You Provide to Us</em> </p>
        <p>All of the personal information we  receive comes directly from our guests.&nbsp; We may collect personal  information from our guests to: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other       promotions </li>
          <li>Report piracy, offer feedback, or other business       inquiries</li>
          <li>Sign up to receive newsletters (such as ESA Tools and       Updates)</li>
          <li>Receive customer or technical support </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information may include: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Name</li>
          <li>E-mail Address </li>
          <li>Telephone Number </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Children</em> </p>
        <p>We don't knowingly collect personal  information from children under 13.&nbsp; We take kids’ privacy seriously, and  encourage parents to play an active role in their children's online experience  at all times. </p>
        <p><em>Information Collected Through  Technology </em> </p>
        <p>We collect information through  technology to make our Web sites more interesting and useful to you.&nbsp; For  example, when you come to one of our Web sites, we collect your IP  address.&nbsp; An IP address often is associated with the portal through which  you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company  or your university.&nbsp; Standing alone, your IP address is not personally  identifiable.&nbsp; At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information  regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our Web  sites.&nbsp; We do not combine the information collected through technology  with your personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p><em>Cookies </em> </p>
        <p>Our Web sites also use  cookies.&nbsp; Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your  computer while you are viewing the Web site. We and other companies use cookies  for a variety of purposes.&nbsp; For example, when you return to one of our Web  sites after logging in, cookies provide information to the Web site so that the  Web site will remember who you are.&nbsp; You can choose to have your computer  warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all  cookies.&nbsp; You can do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer)  settings.&nbsp; Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser  Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.&nbsp; If you turn  cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web  experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our  services may not function properly. </p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#container">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="3" id="3"></a>How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?</h4>
        <p>We don't share, sell or rent your  personal information to third parties without your consent.&nbsp; We don't  require disclosure of personal information to access our Web sites, except for  Gameoverpirates.com, which is only accessible by law enforcement and ESA member  companies.&nbsp; If you prefer not to disclose any personal information, you  may not be able to enjoy certain features of our Web site. </p>
        <p>We will only collect information to  the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate  business objectives. </p>
        <p><em>ESA Tools and Updates </em> </p>
        <p>Information collected from those who  voluntarily submit it to us is used to provide services like updates on special  events, game news and e-mail announcements of interest to our users. We do not  share your personally identifiable information with third party  marketers.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
        <p><em>Operational Uses</em> </p>
        <p>We may also use the personal  information you provide to us for other "Operational Uses."&nbsp; For  example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications  either about your account with us or about features of our Web sites, including  any future changes to this Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p><em>Third Parties</em> </p>
        <p>We occasionally use third parties  (other companies, agents or contractors) to perform services necessary to our  operations.&nbsp; For example, we have partnered with other companies to  personalize our Web pages, analyze customers' interaction with our Web site,  send newsletters and process consumer surveys.&nbsp; We also provide postal  addresses to the U.S. Post Office for delivery purposes.&nbsp; In the course of  providing such services, these private, third party companies may have contact  with your personally identifiable information and have agreed to securely store  and maintain the personal information received from us and only use your  personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><em>Business Information</em> </p>
        <p>For practical reasons, we treat  personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from  information we receive in a non-business capacity.&nbsp; Personal information  submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g., resumes, event sponsorship) may  be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry. </p>
        <p><em>Purchase or Sale of Businesses </em> </p>
        <p>From time to time, we may purchase a  business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable  information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.&nbsp; If we  purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that  business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is  practicable and permissible to do so.&nbsp; If we sell a business, we will  include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat  your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this  Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).&nbsp; The  provisions of this paragraph also will apply if we are sold as part of  bankruptcy proceedings. </p>
        <p><em>Disclosures Required By Law and  Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web sites and Others </em> </p>
        <p>We will disclose personal  information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are  required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or  subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our terms of use; enforce contests,  sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security,  including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or  protect the safety and security of our Web sites or third parties. </p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#container">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="4" id="4"></a>What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?</h4>
        <p>As mentioned above, you have control  over the personal information you submit to us.&nbsp; If at any time you decide  to remove your personal information from our database, you may do so by e-mailing  us at <a href="mailto:privacy@theesa.com">privacy@theesa.com</a>. </p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#container">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="5" id="5"></a>What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?</h4>
        <p>The security and confidentiality of  your information is extremely important to us.&nbsp; We have implemented  technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your  personal information from unauthorized access, improper use, loss or alteration.&nbsp;  We use industry standard practices such as encrypted communications, physically  secured rooms, firewalls and password-protection systems to safeguard the  confidentiality of your personal information.&nbsp; We will notify users of a  data breach involving unencrypted personal information by e-mail or by posting  a notice on the affected Web site. &nbsp;We also strive to limit access to  personal information to employees performing a legitimate business  function.&nbsp; We periodically review our  security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.&nbsp;  However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure  is perfect or impenetrable. </p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#container">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4><a name="6" id="6"></a>How can you update your personal information and profile?</h4>
        <p>You can access and update the  contact information you gave us during registration (that is, your e-mail  address or any other information that would directly enable us to contact you),  by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@theesa.com">privacy@theesa.com</a>. </p>
        <p><em>Your California Privacy Rights</em>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Since 2005, California Civil Code  Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request  certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third  parties for their direct marketing purposes. For inquires regarding our  disclosure policy, please write us: </p>
