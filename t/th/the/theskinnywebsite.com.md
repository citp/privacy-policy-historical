# The Skinny Website: Privacy Policy

**THESKINNYWEBSITE.COM**

**PRIVACY POLICY**

(Last Updated: February 2009)

Thank you for visiting our site. At theskinnywebsite.com (“TSW”), we are committed to protecting the privacy of TSW’s online customers and visitors, and the privacy and security of any information TSW collects through the web site, www.theskinnywebsite.com (including all subpages thereto, the “Website”). TSW has prepared this Privacy Policy to highlight its commitment to your privacy and to inform you as to how TSW will use the information you entrust to TSW in connection with any products and services provided by TSW through the Website (the “Services”). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use the Website nor should you sign up for any Services.

_General Information_

You can visit the Website on the World Wide Web without telling TSW who you are or providing TSW with any personally identifiable information. TSW collects, however, the domain names (not the email addresses unless you choose to provide your email address to TSW) of all visitors to the Website to measure the number of visits, pages visited, average time spent on the Website, etc.

TSW may also conduct online surveys to better understand the needs and profiles of visitors to the Website to measure their interest in the features of the Website. TSW does not currently collect any personal information regarding users of the site. You should note, however, that any information disclosed in public areas of the Website (such as chat rooms or comments on postings) is public information that may be viewed and collected by any party. Since we cannot control the use of information you post on public areas of the Website, you should not disclose any personally identifiable information in these public areas. For example, do not use your real name or e-mail address on any public area of the Website. If you make a posting, we suggest you use a fictitious name, or use only first name or initials. TSW reserves the right to remove any information at any time from our site that we deem inappropriate or for any other reason.

TSW may tailor its offers to you based on information you provide when you purchase products and services, from online surveys, from information that may indicate your purchasing preferences and lifestyle, as well as information available from external sources, including demographic and census data (such as ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites). With your consent, TSW may also share your email address with other reputable companies so that they can send you product and service offers that may be of interest. You will be offered an opportunity to restrict access to your email address if you object to the use of your email address by any party other than TSW. Unless it is specifically stated otherwise, when you are asked for personal information on the Website, you are agreeing to share that information with TSW.

_Limited Information Sharing with Third Parties_

TSW is committed to protecting your privacy. Occasionally, TSW hires other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service they are engaged to provide. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

TSW may share aggregated and anonymous demographic information with our business partners but no such information can be linked directly to any personal information about you.

Although TSW will use every reasonable effort to preserve your privacy, it may need to access and disclose certain information, including personally identifiable information, when required by federal, state local or other governmental regulations or laws. Further, TSW may access and/or disclose information we maintain about users if it believes such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on TSW; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of TSW (including the enforcement of its agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of TSW services or members of the public. In such cases, TSW will use reasonable efforts to disclose only such information as is required under the circumstances.

_Cookies_

The Website uses a technology called “cookies” which may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a tiny element of data (a text file) that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so TSW can recognize you when you return. All pages on the Website where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. These cookies (a) will let TSW know who you are. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, however please note that by not accepting cookies from TSW, you will limit the functionality it can provide when you visit the Website.

_Third-Party Websites_

The Website may include links to other third party web sites. TSW is not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by any third party.

TSW may also allow third-party advertisement serving companies, including advertising networks, to display advertisements on the Website. Advertisement serving companies often place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize your computer each time they display an online advertisement to you. Because these companies may serve advertisements on many different web sites, they may be able to compile information over time about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they display. These companies may use this information to make predictions about your characteristics or preferences and to display targeted advertisements that they believe may be of interest to you. They may also associate this information with your subsequent visit, purchase or other activity on participating advertisers’ web sites in order to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.

These companies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on the company name on the Website and following the links to the web sites of each company.

_Change in Ownership and Other Business Transaction_

In the event TSW goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets (a “Business Transition”), information about our users will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. In such event, TSW’s custody of such information will be transferred subject to all the terms and restrictions in the then current Privacy Policy.

_Amendment of Privacy Policy_

TSW will occasionally update this Privacy Policy. You can determine when the Privacy Policy was last updated by looking at the “last update” date at the top of the policy. If there are material and substantial changes to this Privacy Policy, TSW will note these changes through a prominent notice on the Website. TSW encourages you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how TSW is protecting your personal information.

_Security_

Unfortunately no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While TSW strives to protect Your Information, it cannot warrant the security of the information you provide online. However, once TSW receives your information, it will do its best to ensure that its systems are functioning properly and will use reasonable and customary efforts to protect that information.

_California Residents_

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Website and Services who are California residents to request certain information regarding TSW’s disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to Rian at girl@theskinnywebsite.com.

_Questions_

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this Website, or your dealings with this Website, please send an email to girl@theskinnywebsite.com. Although TSW will in most circumstances be able to receive your email or other information provided through this Website, TSW does not guarantee that it will receive all such email or other information timely and accurately, or that it is legally obligated to read, act on, or respond to any such email or other information.
