# Privacy Policy - The Finance Buff

The privacy of visitors to The Finance Buff is important to us.

At The Finance Buff, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive and collect when you use or visit The Finance Buff, and how we safeguard your information. We never sell your personal information to third parties.

## E-Mail Addresses

The WordPress blog software we use requires an e-mail address when you add a comment to a blog post. It does not have to be a real e-mail address unless you want to use the “notify me of followup comments via e-mail” feature. Please use [anon@example.com](mailto:anon@example.com) if you don’t want to enter your real e-mail address. Whether you enter your real e-mail address or not, it will not be published. We do not use your e-mail address for marketing or disclose your e-mail address to any third party unless required by law.

When you subscribe to blog updates by e-mail using the service provided by Feedburner, or when you contact us using the contact form, we can see your e-mail address. Like the e-mail address entered in blog comments, we do not use your e-mail address for marketing or disclose your e-mail address to any third party unless required by law.

The information provided by the web analytics services include your IP address, your ISP (Internet Service Provider, such as Verizon or Cox Cable), the browser you used to visit the site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited the site and which pages you visited throughout the site.
