Our primary goal in collecting aggregate information from you is to be able to perform site metrics that allow us to improve the functionality of the website.  We need to collect aggregate information in order to track page visits and peak site usage times, and to perform site clickthrough analysis and site layout re-design.

We may use session and persistent “cookies,” session logs, spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags, banner ads or links, and third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as DART, Omniture tags, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, and Google Analytics) to collect aggregate or other non-personally identifiable information about site visitors.  An explanation for each of these items and how they work is included in Section 7 – Methods to Collect Information.

Non-Personally identifiable information collected on social.ford.com may be used to:

  * Compile aggregate and statistical data to help in website design and to identify popular features
  * Measure site activity to allow us to update our site to better meet user wants and needs
  * Make the user experience more customer friendly



social.ford.com utilizes non-personal data for the purpose of performing analytics on the user’s experience while visiting this site. This analysis:

  * Is performed on an aggregate level and does not identify you or your information personally
  * May involve the use of a third-party vendor acting on behalf of social.ford.com

**7.   Methods to Collect Information:**

A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences.  There are a couple different types of cookies.

A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer’s working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser’s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.

A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer’s hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them.  Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.

This site may use third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as DART, Omniture tags, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, and Google Analytics) to capture clickthrough statistics.

social.ford.com may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times.  Emails or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the applicable IP address.  In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.

When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically generates a “session log.”  We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we’re providing is being used.  The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the website that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits. ****

Users may be directed to social.ford.com via banner ads or site links.  Ads or site links that are placed by social.ford.com use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links.  They do not collect personal information from the user.

If you visit this site with an open ID, you may integrate with third-party social media sites, and social.ford.com may track on an aggregate level the number of visits to this site with an open ID, the number of items “liked” on this site, or items on this site that you choose to share with a third-party social media site.

**Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising**

Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising. On some pages of our site we may allow third-party advertising partners to set web tracking tools (e.g., cookies and web beacons) to collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information regarding your activities on those pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day).  We may also share such information we have collected with third-party advertising partners.  These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you when you visit other (non-Ford) sites within their networks.  This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising.”

Pages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices on the page.

Opting out (site pages).  If you do not want your browsing while on such pages to be used for interest-based advertising purposes, you may click on the AdChoices link to opt-out of such uses by the listed advertising partner(s).  Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your site activities and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes as described in this privacy statement.

Opting out (advertisements). **** Advertisements on third-party sites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this privacy statement may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-personally identifiable information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites.  These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.  Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect and use information from the advertisements for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.

Opt-out Compliance Service.  This site and advertisements on third-party sites that link to this privacy statement use the Evidon assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) ([http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/)).  When you opt-out on site pages or through such advertisements, Evidon conveys your opt-out election(s) to the applicable advertising partner(s), which then know to place a cookie on your specific computer and browser (and only the specific computer and browser from which you opt out) indicating that you have opted out. If you clear your browser cookies and wish to remain opted out of interest-based advertising, you must opt-out again.  The list of our advertising partners may be updated from time to time.  To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies, visit <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>.
