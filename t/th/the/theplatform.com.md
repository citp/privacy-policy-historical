# Privacy Policy | thePlatform

As the Internet and the World Wide Web accelerate the exchange of information between businesses and their clients, privacy and the safeguarding of information become increasingly important concerns. On our web site, we occasionally ask you to give us information that helps us learn your requirements so that we can refine both our web site and our product offerings to better match your specific needs. Because we know how important it is to handle any information about you responsibly, we follow a policy that protects your privacy and makes sure that any information you trust us with is used exclusively to help us form a business relationship with you that benefits both your company and thePlatform. 

## What kind of information do we collect?

We only collect information that you volunteer. When you request information from us, we may ask you to fill out a form soliciting information about you, your company, or your business. We might ask for contact information, such as your name, telephone number, address, and e-mail address. And we might ask you to tell us what your job function is or what digital media management solutions your company uses or plans to use. In most cases, the information is required, and you can't receive the information if you don't fill out the form.

## What do we do with the information we collect?

We use the information we collect to build strong business relationships with our customers. We want your business, so we want our sales team to contact you. But when they do, we want them to know your needs and business requirements so they can offer you solutions that help your business succeed. We also use your contact information to send you information that we hope will help you make sound purchasing decisions - white papers discussing industry trends; customer newsletters; invitations to events such as seminars, Webcasts, and user conferences; and product announcements and upgrades.

## Do we sell or otherwise share the information we collect?

The information you share with us is confidential. We never sell it. We may on occasion share it with business partners such as systems integrators who help us implement the solutions our customers buy, but only with your express permission.

## Do we use cookies?

When you visit our web site, our web server places a "cookie" on your hard disk - a small piece of information that tells our web server, when you revisit our site, whether you've visited before. It also tells us what sections of our web site you visit. Why do we use cookies? To analyze traffic and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of our web site design and the usefulness of the information the site displays. We use them to identify usage patterns so that we can offer you a more effective web site that has the information you need to evaluate our solutions and services.

## Do these policies apply to third-party sites linked to thePlatform site?

The policy described here applies only to information you supply directly to thePlatform via the thePlatform web site or via e-mail in response to offers and promotions on the thePlatform web site. As you explore thePlatform.com, you may find links to other web resources - partner and customer sites and professional resources such as organizations and publications. Our privacy policies do not apply to these web sites, and you should check the policies of any linked site before offering information to the sponsor of the site.
