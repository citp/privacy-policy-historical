# Mamamia - Privacy Policy

### 1\. Your Privacy

Mamamia.com.au Pty Limited (ACN 105 572 192) (“Mamamia”, “we”, “us”, “our”) recognises that your privacy is very important to you and believes that information received by us that can be used to identify an individual user (“you”, “your”, “User”) should be treated with respect. We are serious about adhering to the Australian Privacy Principals and other applicable privacy legislation. 

Before providing us with any information, you should read through this policy so that you understand and are comfortable with exactly how we will collect and what we will do with any information you share with Us. This Privacy Policy will also tell you how to access your information and/or seek correction of your information if desired. 

By using the Mamamia Sites and/or Services covered by this Policy and providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your account information and usage. 

Please refer to the “Enforcement” Section (Section 11) at the end of this Privacy Policy for our contact details should you wish to contact us about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices. 

### 2\. What We Collect

#### Personal and Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We collect “Personal Information”, as well as non-personally identifiable information on Mamamia Sites and/or Services. 

“Personal Information,” as used in this Policy, is personally identifiable information, such as your first and last name, mailing address, email address, billing information, IP addresses, demographics, passwords, telephone numbers and/or other online contact information. “Personal Information” can also include data that is usually non-personally identifiable (such as location data, data about personal attributes or online identifiers) but that, taken together with other collected data, identifies a natural person, either directly or indirectly. 

#### Sensitive Information

Mamamia does not collect sensitive information from users for marketing purposes. 

“Sensitive Information” includes information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or affiliations, political opinions, philosophical beliefs, health or genetic information, sexual preference or information about whether an individual is a member of a professional or trade association or union. 

  
Sensitive information might be collected during the course of surveys or competitions administered by Mamamia or its affiliated third parties, but only if volunteered by Users with their consent. 

You can choose not to actively volunteer information to Mamamia. However if you do provide information to Mamamia when asked or prompted, including Sensitive Information, you are also providing consent for Mamamia to collect, store and use that information as necessary for the purpose of collecting it. 

### 3\. How We Collect Information

We collect information in three ways.

(1) Voluntarily

(2) Automatically

(3) Via Third Party Sources

#### Voluntarily

We collect information you provide to us in optional, voluntary submissions, including but not limited to: 

(1) registration forms or user profiles, when you provide your name, email address or other information to us voluntarily; 

(2) subscriptions, when you sign up to our newsletters by providing your name and email address; 

(3) entries to promotions, sweepstakes, competitions or contest, by providing your name and email address and other Personal Information depending on the entry requirements; 

(4) feedback communications or customer service requests, where you may supply or we may ask for your name and contact details; 

(5) software and mobile application downloads, where you may provide your name and contact details and other information for the purposes of signing up to the application and obtaining its services; and 

(6) curriculum vitae submissions, where you provide your Personal Information to us. 

#### Automatically

We create and record information automatically when you visit our Site. We use cookies (or files sent directly to your computer or device) and other similar technology to collect information such as your IP address, the site you visited immediately prior to our Site and the frequency and duration of your visit to our Site. 

We may track activity relating to your interaction with our email communications and with links contained within our email communications and our Site. 

  
We may also collect, use, and share, with Mamamia partners, service providers and licensees, precise location data, including the real-time location of your mobile or fixed location device. 

Some cookies may be associated with Personal Information about you and some may not. This information is generally collected, used and stored to deliver relevant messaging and enhance your experience when visiting our Site. Wherever possible, we anonymise and pseudonymise your Personal Information. 

For more information about how Personal Information and non-personally identifiable information is used in relation to marketing and advertising go to “How We Use Your Information – Marketing & Advertising” and “Your Choices – Marketing & Advertising”. 

#### Via Third Party Sources

We may also obtain information, including Personal Information, from third party sources. This may include soliciting third parties to collect non-personally identifiable and personally identifiable information on our behalf. In such cases we instruct those third parties to comply with this Policy and require confirmation of their compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. 

We may use analytics tools and other third party technologies, to collect non-personally identifiable information in the form of various usage and user metrics when you use our Sites and/or Services. These third party analytics companies may combine the information collected for us with other information they have independently collected across their network of websites, products and services. 

Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. 

For example, we have implemented Google Analytics Advertising features to collect data about your traffic via Google advertising cookies and identifiers. 

At the moment we only use these tools to collect non-personally identifiable information. We will only use these tools to collect personally identifiable information with your express, informed consent. We do not identify users or merge non-personally identifiable information that we collect with other information to make it personally identifiable. 

Our properties may also feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which provides market research, like Digital Content Ratings, by collecting anonymous and pseudonymous information from users. To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and your choices with regard to it, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy at <http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy> . 

You may, at any time, opt out of the data collection or analytics practices offered by the third party organisations that we use on our Site. Please refer to Point 8, Marketing and Advertising for opt out options. 

### 4\. Security and Integrity

We take measures, including the implementation and maintenance of physical, electronic, and managerial procedures, in an effort to assure the security, integrity, and accuracy of all Personal Information that we collect. If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. 

We will destroy or de-identify your information if we no longer require the information to provide you with access to our Site/s or Services and if the information is not required to be saved under Australian law or other Commonwealth record. 

### 5\. Storage

We store your information on networks in Australia and the US and take steps to protect your Personal Information from misuse, loss or unauthorized access. These reasonable steps include password access, firewalls, and secure servers. 

### 6\. How We Use Information

Generally, we use Personal Information to establish and enhance our relationship with our Users through four main categories: 

(1) Communication

(2) Optimization

(3) Marketing & Advertising; and

(4) Sharing Features.

Below, we provide some specific examples of how we use the information we collect.

#### Marketing & Advertising

To personalise and display advertisements and other content for you, we may drop a cookie on your browser linked to data that is known about you so that third party advertisers can show you more relevant ads.

Unless you have provided us with express, informed consent to collect your personal information for targeted marketing and advertising purposes, the information that is collected is not personally identifiable, and is pseudonymous or aggregated data that does not identify any individual user. 

  
The third party analytics companies that we use may share the User information they collect from our Sites with other measurement companies, who gather data from various sources, analyse and report on it for their clients. The reported information will cover various elements, for example it may summarise how many people have viewed a certain webpage within a certain age bracket. 

In some instances, the non-personally identifiable information collected from our Site and/or Services may be linked with information collected by a third party source, such as Google Analytics, to become personally identifiable. We will not link or merge non-personally identifiable information collected by Us with personally-identifiable information collected by a third party organisation, such as Google Analytics, without your informed, express consent. Google may merge or link your information with the non-personally identifiable information collected from our Site and/or Services if You have expressly provided your consent for them to do that.
