# Customer Service: The Limited

As you may have noted, as of September 2008 our site is a full e-commerce site, so many of the revisions that you see in this privacy policy are the result of this change to our site. 

This Privacy Policy applies only to the information collected online by TheLimited.com.

WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DOES THELIMITED.COM COLLECT ONLINE?

  
**1\. General Browsing:**   
TheLimited.com gathers navigational information about where visitors go on our Web site and information about the technical efficiencies of our Web site and services (i.e., time to connect to our Web site, time to download pages, etc.). This information allows us to see which areas of our Web site are most visited and helps us better understand our visitors' experiences at TheLimited.com. With the navigational information, we can improve the quality of our Web site by recognizing and delivering more of the features, areas and services our visitors prefer. In the process of gathering navigational information, non-personally identifiable information (for example, domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected which will provide information regarding a visitor's use of our Web site. 

  
**2\. Collection of Personal Information:**   
TheLimited.com may ask you to provide personal information when you establish or update an Account on this site, sign up to receive e-mails from The Limited or other marketing materials, make a purchase, create or update your My Favorites list, send items to a friend, view your order history, participate in contests, surveys or contact us. 

HOW DOES THELIMITED.COM USE AND SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ONLINE?

TheLimited.com uses the information you provide to:

  * deliver products that you have ordered, 
  * to contact you or the product recipient(s) in the event of order delay or difficulty,
  * to deliver information through the various communication channels you have provided to us about our products or website, including adding you to our email list or to our customer phone and mail marketing list when you register for an account or make a purchase
  * to send information about events, surveys, promotions and possibly contests to you,
  * to tailor your experience on our website to your interests, 
  * if you have set up an Account at this site you may save personal information in that Account, such as name and shipping information, and we will access this saved information to make your shopping quicker and easier.  We require you to create and/or access your Account to use various services on the Website, such as your order history, and My Favorites.  Because you must create or access your Account prior to using these services, it is possible that we could associate you with the information you provide through these services,
  * We will use the information you provide in a career profile, including in your resume, to assist in your goal of becoming an associate with The Limited and, if hired, we will use the information submitted for employment and business-related purposes,
  * to develop our products, services, and Website, and 
  * to respond to your inquiries. 



With respect to The Limited e-mail, you will receive exclusive information about special offers, media events, new products and much more. If at any time you would like to stop future delivery of The Limited e-mail, please follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of each message. Please note, however, that your request not to receive email information will not preclude us from contacting you by email or otherwise regarding questions we have about your purchase and other operational e-mails, such as shipping information.

WHAT INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES?

We may use third party vendors to help us provide services to you, such as monitoring site activity, hosting the Web site, processing orders, running promotions and events and surveys, maintaining our database, providing store locator services, processing employment applications, and administering and monitoring e-mails.

We may make names and addresses collected online available to other companies. If you do not wish to have your name and address shared with other companies (other than third parties who provide services to TheLimited.com) please call us at 1-877-LTD-1963.

When you send an E-mail a Friend from TheLimited.com, we will send your selected recipient your e-mail address, message, and your selected outfit or item(s). We may include an opportunity for the recipient to sign up to receive promotional materials from TheLimited.com.

World Financial Network National Bank (WFNNB) issues and owns The Limited credit card accounts. If you apply online for a Limited credit card with WFNNB and, once opened, you elect to pay your account online, you will be providing your personal information directly to WFNNB and the information you provide to WFNNB would be subject to WFNNB's privacy policies.  We also use a third party when you purchase our gift certificates online (giftcertificates.com).  If you purchase one of our gift certificates online, you will be providing your personal information directly to giftcertificates.com and that information would be subject to the giftcertificates.com privacy policy.
