**When personal information is used and disclosed**

The primary purpose of collection is determined by the reason we collected and/or submitted the information.  For example, if you subscribed to our mailing list, we will use your personal information to send you emails.

Other reasons include:

  * verifying your identity if you enter a contest or subscribe to our mailing list;
  * communicating with you in general:

  * sponsors of contests to allow the sponsor to award the prize of the contest or trade promotion.
