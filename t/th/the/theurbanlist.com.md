## Collection of Personal Information

The Urban List only collects information about you that you elect to provide to us (e.g. during the registration process, or when you add businesses to your list of favourites).

We may automatically record other information provided by your web browser as well, in order to provide you with a better Urban List experience. Information that is automatically collected may include your domain name (the web address after the @ symbol in your email); the IP address used to connect to the Internet; the average time spent on our website; the number of pages you view and the time you view them for; search terms you use to find us; and the websites you visit before landing on our site. The amount of information collected depends on the settings of your web browser. We use Google Analytics to supply this information.

## Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to the hard drive of a visitor's computer for record-keeping purposes. These cookies will enhance your Urban List experience by storing information about your preferences. Most major websites use cookies and the majority of internet browsers are pre-set to accept them. However, if you prefer not to receive cookies you can disable them within your computer’s browser preferences.

On occasion, we will be required to disclose some of your personal information to third party organisations, including outsourced service providers; legal, accounting, financial or other professional advisors; regulatory, government and other authorities as required by law; and our related organisations.

Information that we collect from your web browser will be used to enhance your Urban List experience, enabling us to provide personalised content that is tailored to your needs.

  * There are reasonable grounds to believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent a threat to life or health; or
