### NBS Privacy Policy

RIBA Enterprises Limited (trading as NBS) (“we” or “us” in this policy) respects your privacy and will do its best to safeguard your personal information.

We sometimes need to collect and hold personal information so that we can deliver our services and products to you and/or your employer. If we do not collect such personal information, then we may be unable to provide you with the services and products you have requested or need to use in the course of your work.

This privacy policy tells you about our use of any personal information you give to us including via phone, by email, in letters or by using our services, products or online content. This policy also tells you about personal information we may obtain from sources other than directly from you.

Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page (and, where appropriate, notified to you by email). Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.

### How to contact us about this policy

We hope that we can resolve any query or concern you may raise about our use of your information.

If you have any questions about how we may use your personal information data, have any concerns or wish to make a complaint about our handling of your personal information, please contact us by post at:

The Old Post Office  
St Nicholas Street

or by email to [privacy@RIBAEnterprises.com](mailto:privacy@RIBAEnterprises.com).

We will investigate any complaints you notify to us and we will aim to ensure that any complaint and any queries you submit to us are resolved in a timely and appropriate manner.

The [General Data Protection Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) also gives you the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority at any time. The supervisory authority in the UK is the Information Commissioner who may be contacted at [https://ico.org.uk/concerns](http://ico.org.uk/concerns/) or telephone: 0303 123 1113. You can contact the ICO at any time if you have any concerns about how we collect or process your personal information, but we hope that you will contact us first to discuss your concerns and give us an opportunity to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

### 1\. Who we are

NBS is leading the built environment with powerfully connected knowledge, products and services around the world. Please see “How to contact us” above for our full company details and who to contact if you have any concerns about how we collect and process your personal information.

### 2\. What personal information we collect

Personal information means any information that identifies or can be used to identify you directly or indirectly.

When you use any of our services, products or online content, whether on your own behalf or your employer’s behalf, we may receive personal information about you.

The kind of information we collect and hold includes, but is not limited to:

  * Your name (first and last name)
  * Email address
  * Telephone number and
  * Company name
  * Your profession
  * CV (if applying for a vacancy with NBS or its subsidiary companies).



We may also keep information about your use and payment for our services, products and online. 

### 3\. Information about other people

Should you provide information to us about any person other than yourself, such as your employees, your suppliers, or your counter parties you must ensure that such third parties have been informed and understand how their personal information will be used and that they have given their permission or you have other lawful grounds under the data protection legislation justifying you disclosing it to us and for you to allow us to use it lawfully and in the ways outlined in this privacy policy.

### 4\. How we obtain personal information

**Directly by you**  
Most personal information we hold will be collected by us directly from you. For example you may provide personal information to us when you: 

  * Set up an NBS ID account 
  * Provide personal information on a subscription order form
  * Provide personal information to us via telephone, email, letter or your CV.



**Not directly by you**  
There are certain circumstances where we may obtain your personal information without you providing that information to us direct. For example, if a recruiter provides your CV to us for consideration as part of a job application. Or where your employer provides your email address to us in order to obtain user access for you to one of our subscription products, services or content.

### 5\. How we protect your personal information

We take appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction and to comply with our obligations under the data protection legislation.

We provide services to you from data centres with 24/7 physical security. Our data centres have international security accreditation including ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 9001:2015. All our data centres are based within the EEA. We secure your connections to our services with TLS encryption.

Your personal information is logically separated from other’s to ensure data segregation.

NBS ID accounts need a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. NBS ID passwords are hashed, which means we cannot see your password. We cannot resend forgotten passwords; we will only provide instructions on how to reset them.

We restrict our access to your personal information by job role and limit staff access to your personal information to those individuals who have a genuine business need to access it. All employees receive regular security training and sign our information security policy annually. We have an ongoing programme to raise security awareness.

Although we make all reasonable efforts to prevent the loss or misuse of your personal information, we cannot guarantee your personal information will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the internet. Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that we assume no liability regarding the theft, loss, alteration, or misuse of your personal information during transmission.

### 6\. How long your personal information will be kept

**We will keep your personal information while you have an account with us or we are providing products and services to you.**  
Thereafter, we will keep your personal information for as long as is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure we can:

  * respond to any questions, complaints or claims made by you or on your behalf;
  * show that we treated you fairly; and
  * keep records required by applicable laws or regulations.



We will not retain your personal information for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this policy. Different retention periods apply for different types of personal information and we can make available more detailed information on our retention and deletion policies upon request.

When it is no longer necessary to retain your personal information, we will securely delete or anonymise it.

**Personal information from a CV or employment application**  
We will process such information on the basis of preparation to perform a contract with the candidate and/or legitimate interests in recruiting and vetting potential employees of the business.

We will hold such data for a maximum of 6 months for unsuccessful candidates but for successful candidates we will hold such data for at least the duration of employment and usually for a period of 7 years thereafter (the length of time being determined by our regulatory and legal obligations, and any potential for legal claims).

### 7\. How we use your personal information

Under data protection law, we can only use your personal information if we have a lawful reason for doing so. We may process your personal information in connection with any of the purposes set out in this policy or more on the following legal grounds:

* because our legitimate interests, or those of a third party recipient of your personal information, make the processing necessary, provided that those interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; or

Please note a legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information, so long as this is not overridden by your own rights and interests.
