### Cookies and web analytics

We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.

We also use third party advertisements on  **https://theitbros.com**  to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program ([Adsense terms](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites) and list of [Adsense ad providers](https://theitbros.com/ad-providers/)) and Google Analytics, Amazon ads) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.

### DoubleClick DART cookies

We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (“interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.

### Information you make public or give to others

There are lots of ways that you can find yourself providing data to other people, like when you are posting a public message on a forum thread, share information using social media, or make a contact with another user (such as a third party Author) whether via our site or directly through email. Before making your information publicly available or giving your information to anyone else, think carefully. If giving information to another user via our sites, ask them how they will handle your information. If you’re sharing information via another website, check the privacy policy for that site to understand its information management practices as this privacy policy will not apply.



### How long we keep your personal information

  1. We retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide the services to you and others, and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your personal data, you can request that we erase your personal information (you can do that via Contact form on the website).



### How you can access your personal data

  1. You are also entitled to ask us to erase it, or restrict its processing. You also have rights to object to some processing that is based on our legitimate interests, such as profiling that we perform for the purposes of direct marketing, and, where we have asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent as more fully described below.
  2. In case you have concerns that are not resolved – you also have the right to complain to data protection authorities. The relevant data protection authority will be the data protection authority of the country: (1) of your habitual residence; (2) of your place of work; or (3) in which you consider the alleged infringement has occurred.
