			<p>We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines the information we collect and how we use it. 
			This Policy applies solely to information collected through this Site and not other sources.</p>

			<h3>Conditional Use of this Site.</h3>

			<p>Your access to and use of this website and its contents (the “Site”) is subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy” or “Policy”), and all applicable laws.

			<h3>Collection of your personal information.</h3>

			<p>We collect personal information about you (i.e. information which may identify you in some way, such as your name, address, age, other contact details such as telephone number, email address etc. and passwords) through this website only when you voluntarily submit it. This may be when you register on the website, request information, submit comments or participate in some game, promotion, survey or other feature of the website. Providing personal information is up to you. If you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it.</p>

			<h3>Use of your personal information.</h3>

			<p>We may use your personal information as follows:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>To respond to your questions and requests, to provide you with access to certain areas and features and to communicate with you about your activities on this website.</li> 
				<li>To share it with our Related Parties as required to perform functions on our behalf in connection with the Site (such as delivery of merchandise, administration of the website or promotions or other features on it, marketing, data analysis or customer services).  To do so, it may be necessary for us to transmit your personal information to outside the above Jurisdiction*, and, where the site is based within the European Economic Area (EEA), to outside the EEA, and you agree to this transfer.  Further use or disclosure of the information by them for other purposes is not permitted.</li> 
			</ul>

				<li>The EEA currently comprises the following states: Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Lithuania, Estonia, Spain, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Austria, Greece, Latvia, Hungary, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden.</li>
				<li>To provide you with product information or promotional and other offers from us or our Related Parties*. </li>
				<li>However, at the point of collection of your information we will provide you either an “opt in” or “opt-out” mechanism depending on the requirements of the Site’s Jurisdiction and the Site.   An “opt-in” mechanism will provide you the opportunity to positively indicate that you would like or do not object to our sending you such further communications and we will not send you any unless you have “opted-in”.  An “opt-out” mechanism will provide you the opportunity to indicate that you do not want us to send you such further communications, and if you “opt-out” we will not send you any. </li>
				<li>Either way, opting-in or opting-out will be up to you and, in addition, if you do not want us to use your personal information for a particular purpose or disclose it to a third party, you may “opt out” at any time by contacting us as provided above.</li> 
				<li>Specific opt-outs may also be provided at the point of collection or along with the communications to you. </li>
				<li>Please note though, by opting-out, you may not be able to participate in certain activities on the Site.</li>  
			</ul>
			
			<ul>
				<li>For other purposes set out when your information is collected or in any additional terms and conditions applicable to the particular feature of the Site.</li>  
				<li>For disclosures required by law, regulation or court order.</li>
				<li>For the purpose of or in connection with legal proceedings or necessary for establishing, defending or exercising legal rights.</li>  
				<li>In an emergency to protect the health or safety of Site users or the general public or in the interests of national security.</li>
				<li>Except as provided in herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to any third parties without your specific consent.</li> 
			</ul>
