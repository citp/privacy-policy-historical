### **Our Privacy Commitment**

[](https://www.esrb.org/confirm/esa-confirmation.jsp)

The Entertainment Software Association, and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "ESA"), respects the privacy rights of our online visitors and recognizes the importance of protecting all information that you may choose to share with us.  To further this commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") to guide how we collect, store and use the information you provide to us.

This Privacy Statement and the certification seal shown on this page confirm that ESA is a member in good standing of ESRB's Privacy Certified Program.  ESRB's Privacy Certified Program is designed to ensure that our Web sites’ information disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate.  To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our Web sites have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection and use practices. As part of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our Web sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB.

Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information submitted and collected online, and does not apply to information that may be collected by ESA offline.  This Privacy Policy applies only to Web sites maintained by ESA, and not to our international affiliates, or any web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link.  ESA, therefore, is not responsible for the content or activities provided on those web sites.

#### What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?

We don't require personal information to access our Web sites.  However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of our Web site.  Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you.  To offer our guests certain features on our Web site, we may collect several types of personally identifiable information.

_Information You Provide to Us_

All of the personal information we receive comes directly from our guests.  We may collect personal information from our guests to: 

  * Participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions 
  * Report piracy, offer feedback, or other business inquiries
  * Sign up to receive newsletters (such as ESA Tools and Updates)
  * Receive customer or technical support 



This information may include: 

  * Name
  * E-mail Address 
  * Telephone Number 



_Children_

We don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  We take kids’ privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times. 

_Information Collected Through Technology_

We collect information through technology to make our Web sites more interesting and useful to you.  For example, when you come to one of our Web sites, we collect your IP address.  An IP address often is associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company or your university.  Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable.  At times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our Web sites.  We do not combine the information collected through technology with your personally identifiable information.

_Cookies_

Our Web sites also use cookies.  Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes.  For example, when you return to one of our Web sites after logging in, cookies provide information to the Web site so that the Web site will remember who you are.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.  You can do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings.  Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.

#### How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?

We don't share, sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your consent.  We don't require disclosure of personal information to access our Web sites, except for Gameoverpirates.com, which is only accessible by law enforcement and ESA member companies.  If you prefer not to disclose any personal information, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of our Web site. 

We will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. 

_ESA Tools and Updates_

Information collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us is used to provide services like updates on special events, game news and e-mail announcements of interest to our users. We do not share your personally identifiable information with third party marketers.    

_Operational Uses_

We may also use the personal information you provide to us for other "Operational Uses."  For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Web sites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy. 

_Third Parties_

We occasionally use third parties (other companies, agents or contractors) to perform services necessary to our operations.  For example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize our Web pages, analyze customers' interaction with our Web site, send newsletters and process consumer surveys.  We also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office for delivery purposes.  In the course of providing such services, these private, third party companies may have contact with your personally identifiable information and have agreed to securely store and maintain the personal information received from us and only use your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

_Business Information_

For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity.  Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g., resumes, event sponsorship) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry. 

_Purchase or Sale of Businesses_

From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.  If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.  If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).  The provisions of this paragraph also will apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings. 

_Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web sites and Others_

We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our terms of use; enforce contests, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or protect the safety and security of our Web sites or third parties.

#### What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?

As mentioned above, you have control over the personal information you submit to us.  If at any time you decide to remove your personal information from our database, you may do so by e-mailing us at [privacy@theesa.com](mailto:privacy@theesa.com). 

[Back to Top](http://www.theesa.com/privacy/index.asp#container)

#### What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?

The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us.  We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, improper use, loss or alteration.  We use industry standard practices such as encrypted communications, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password-protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information.  We will notify users of a data breach involving unencrypted personal information by e-mail or by posting a notice on the affected Web site.  We also strive to limit access to personal information to employees performing a legitimate business function.  We periodically review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.  However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time.  If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you provided us, or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Web sites covered by this Privacy Policy.  Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective 30 days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or 30 days following our posting of notice of the changes on the Web sites covered by this Privacy Policy.
