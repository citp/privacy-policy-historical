Thank you for visiting our web site and reviewing our privacy policy. Our privacy policy is clear. We will not collect any personal information about you when you visit our web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

Here is how we handle information about your visit to our web site:

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically  
** If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the web site, do searches, read pagers, enter or download information, we will automatically gather and store certain information about your visit. This information will identify you personally, but no information about users/visitors will be sold, shared, or utilized in any commercial way. We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:

1\. The Internet domain (for example “company.com”) if you use a private Internet access account, and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our web site;

WE DO TRACK AND RECORD INFORMATION ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF USERS AND THEIR VISITS BUT DO NOT DISCLOSE SAME EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE USER AGREEMENT OR BELOW.

Sometimes we write a small file on the user’s computer called a “session cookie.” Session cookies automatically expire when users leave a Web site; session cookies retain information only during the session or for the purpose of completing a particular online transaction, without any capacity to track users over time and across different web sites. Other than a session cookie, and the six items described above, we do not obtain any information from the user or the user’s computer. We do not use “persistent cookies.”

1\. The information will not be shared with anyone not on the staff of Therap Services.

3\. We do not create individual profiles with the e-mail information you provide or give it to any other organizations.

4\. The e-mail material, including your e-mail address and/or name will in no way be correlated or linked to the material that is automatically collected as described above.

5\. We do not collect information for commercial marketing.

The only exceptions to Item 4 above would be pursuant to a bona fide Court Order.

The use we will make of your information is to

1\. Consider your suggestions.

2\. Possibly respond directly to you for clarification of information.

3\. Try and answer your questions if you ask them.

4\. To create summaries of reports and other relevant data for the governmental agencies responsible for the care of Care Recipients, as defined in the User Agreement, but such summaries shall not identify individuals or entities unless pursuant to a bona fide court order.
