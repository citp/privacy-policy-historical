#### INFORMATION & COOKIES

In order to perform certain search inquiries and handle the technological navigation through our web sites, we sometimes have to have a way to identify who has requested what from our website. We may do this, through means of a "cookie" which is used by The Green Head to identify certain technology settings. These cookies are only for use on our website and do not affect your computer in any way. 

We may use cookies to track usage of the Site and further customize your experience when you are visiting our site. By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the Site best serve the users. We never give out information to others about individual usage. However, we may provide advertisers with aggregate information about our users, such as "100,000 people viewed your ad today.".

Some of our third party advertisers and affiliates may use cookies on the Site to track information such as the number of times an advertisement has been viewed (but not personal identifying information such as user names). The Green Head may give third party advertisers permission to set cookies for advertising, but The Green Head has no control over or access to such third party cookies.

#### WHAT CAN A COOKIE DO/NOT DO?

A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. This element of data is a piece of text, not a program. The Site can only access the information from a cookie sent by the Site. We cannot access other cookies sent by other web sites nor the information contained therein. Additionally, we cannot learn your email address or any other information about you through the use of a cookie.

However, some portions of the Site may require registration in order to access those areas. In such case, we ask that you register and provide us with basic information on our registration page. Finally in other cases, our website may not handle your "navigation request" correctly, without a cookie.
