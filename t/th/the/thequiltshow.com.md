This Privacy Policy does not apply to web sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we link. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by ARJJ Inc. online, not offline.

**Third Party Sites**  
If you click on a link to a third party site, including our sponsor's, advertiser's or member's websites, you leave the ARJJ Inc. site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personal information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as ARJJ Inc. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to an ARJJ Inc. site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.

**What is personal information and when does TheQuiltshow collect it?**  
Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you on-line or off-line. ARJJ Inc. collects personal information from our online visitors during (1) the member registration, (2) contests (registration or claiming a prize), 3) warranty registration and/or during customer support or technical service requests, (4) marketing surveys and email campaigns, (5) when you order products or subscriptions from us online, (6) when you request services from third party service providers on our site, or (7) through the use of our online services.

**A Special Note About Children**  
ARJJ Inc. encourages parents to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. Therefore, children age 12 or younger are not permitted to become a member of The Quilt Show without written permission or other verifiable consent from a parent or guardian. A Consent Form is available upon request. This consent form must be completed, signed by a parent or legal guardian, and sent to the address found on our "Contact" page. Once we validate this form, the appropriate permission form will be made available and instructions for registering will be provided. This form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to ARJJ Inc. by fax or mail to the Privacy Policy Administrator.

Once we have obtained parental consent and a child is registered, we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.

If for any reason you are concerned that your child's personally identifiable information maintained by ARJJ Inc. is not correct or complete, should you wish to have your child's personal information deleted from our records, or if you want ARJJ Inc. to discontinue further collection or use of your child's personal information, please contact your Privacy Policy Administrator who will be happy to review, update or remove your child's information as appropriate.
