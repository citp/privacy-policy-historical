<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><span><span>Welcome to The Real Tooth Fairies. Please review each part of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use before using this service. </span></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><span>Here at the Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC, (referenced as “RCRF,” “us,” or “we”) we are dedicated to protecting your online privacy when visiting our sites and related mobile apps. We are committed to child safety and providing your child with a wholesome play experience online. &nbsp;We want to  share the steps we have taken to make this a safe and secure environment. Parents, you can support your child’s healthy use of apps or internet by spending quality time with your children and observing your children’s use of digital media online. To help assure a positive, enriching online experience for all our guests, we provide this Privacy Policy, including information about how &nbsp;we collect, use and disclose personal information.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><span>Whenever we reference the term “parents” below, we intend to include legal guardians. Note that sites/servers related to the website and app are located in the U.S.&nbsp;By using this media, you agree to the transfer, collection, processing and use of data by Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC, its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies. Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC &nbsp;adheres to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supports guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. in all of our sites and apps for children. </span></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><span>We encourage our guests to read and understand our Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to alter, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy (including Terms of Use) at any time and said changes are effective upon &nbsp;posting of the revised Policy at the domain where the previous policy version was posted. Parents, please refer to this Privacy Policy. Notices of changes to this Policy may be sent by email or other means, but that does not waive a guest’s responsibility to regularly read the Policy’s latest version and to terminate use of the service if you are not in agreement  with the most current Policy. Continuing to use the website or app constitutes your acceptance of the terms herein.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><span>Our certified Kid-Safe interactive world for children allows no chat between  users and there is no exchange of child-written content that can be shared online from child-to-child.&nbsp;Any areas where children write content are only  viewable from that child’s own computer or app and member account or parent account; their writing is not viewable by any other child online or in that other child’s app. Words children write to their Real Tooth Fairy are shared with the child’s parent, but never with other child site or app guests. </span></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><span>Please help us protect your child’s privacy by instructing your child to never provide personally identifying information on this site or any other without your permission. </span></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"> <b>1. What information we collect:</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Your child can explore the online site or mobile app and view some content without any information being collected. When a child does a free site registration at our site or in an app, the only information collected is the child first name, birth date (to validate guest age), a fictitious child member name, child password and parent’s email. During the registration process, we do not collect any other information from children.&nbsp;A child’s participation in any of this site or app’s activities never requires a child to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity. A child does have to have a previously created free child registration account with The Real Tooth Fairies to use this app. The child is required to enter the fictitious or nickname user name she created at registration and her password to enter this app. The app also may ask users to provide information that is not personally identifiable through preset choices such as what number tooth was lost.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><b>2. How we notify and obtain parent consent for collection of information from their children:</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">For the free child registration which occurs separately from the content of this app, parents receive a welcome email from us immediately when their child does their free registration and we allow 48 hours for parents to refuse their child’s registration. If the parent does not contact us by email, mail or phone, we assume the parent is consenting to the child’s registration. If the parent refuses the child’s registration, which can occur at any time, we cancel the child account per the parent’s request within 5 business days or less. This child account cancellation will make it impossible for that child to log in to this app. A parent may cancel the child’s participation by clicking in the registration’s Welcome email link that says: “to cancel this Real Tooth Fairies account, click here.” Or a parent may go to the “For Parents” page, scroll to the bottom above the Official Seal and click the line that says: “to cancel a child’s participation on this site or a parent member account, <a href="http://trf-content.s3.amazonaws.com/printable_pdfs/parents/parental_review.pdf">click here</a>.”&nbsp;This link offers a form to submit to our site via mail refusing your child’s participation on the site. The Contact Us page also shows parents a phone number and email address to make this or any other request. Inside this app, at the start of the Privacy Policy page, parents also have a link to cancel their child’s participation in the app and website.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><b>3. How can parents view, change or delete personally identifiable information about their child?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">By identifying yourself appropriately, parents may review their child’s personal information that we have collected at the website TheRealToothFairies.com. Parents can, at any time, refuse to permit the site and app to collect further personal information and can request that any personal information collected be deleted by providing the parent email and child member name by contacting Guest Services by email at <a href="mailto:help@therealtoothfairies.com">help@therealtoothfairies.com</a> or call 910-509-0565. Or a parent may go to the “For Parents” page, scroll to the bottom above the Official Seal and click the line that says: “to cancel a child’s participation on this site or a parent member account, <a href="http://trf-content.s3.amazonaws.com/printable_pdfs/parents/parental_review.pdf">click here</a>.”&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">The RCRF site and this app offer communication with parents about their child’s activities so parents have the option to choose if they want to be involved directly with the girl’s online or app activities with her Real Tooth Fairy. Many parents choose to be helpers to their daughter’s Real Tooth Fairy to create special family moments by going to the Parent’s Only Zone, but this is not required for children to participate in site or app activities.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">As stated, parents receive a welcome email called Share Mail when your child does the free site Registration and/or takes the Royal Quiz to get matched up to a Real Tooth Fairy at the website, TheRealToothFairies.com. In this app, when the child completes a message to her tooth fairy by asking for a tooth fairy letter, a Share Mail email is sent to parents referencing your child by first name and sharing with the parent the specific message your child wrote to her Real Tooth Fairy. Through these emails, parents see what their child writes to her Real Tooth Fairy and can choose to respond in any way they wish. Parents may opt out of receiving Share Mail or they may opt out of special promotional offer emails by clicking the Share Mail Preferences button in My Profile Page in My Royal Account at the Parent’s Only Zone section of the website TheRealToothFairies.com. &nbsp;Parents may also click “unsubscribe” in any parent email and within 5 business days, they will receive no more informational or promotional emails from us. The My Royal Account area is where parents can view their purchase history, their Upgraded Membership History and their Magic Letter History and Child Profile. Parents may change your information, reset your password or change your child’s first name and password. A parent may also change information by emailing <a href="mailto:help@therealtoothfairies.com">help@therealtoothfairies.com</a> or calling our Guest Services number on the Contact Us page.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">RCRF does not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information in any website or app activities.&nbsp;There are no chat rooms or message boards. In keeping with child-safe policies, children can on the website view other children’s fictitious screen names for the site (not the child first name), they can view other avatar/dolls, castle rooms, and pre-set pictures of generic site activities that another user has recently done, such as a generic picture shows when a user recently played a site game or a generic preset letter topic title and picture that a user chose in doing this app. However in viewing these generic images, there is no child-written content or personally identifying information shown and there is no way in our site or app activities to exchange any child-created or personally identifying information among children under age 13.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><b>4. How does Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC use personally identifiable information collected about children?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">At RCRF, we don’t require anyone to share any information about themselves in order to enjoy certain free features of our websites or apps. You may visit parts of our web sites or certain mobile apps without any need to register. However, some apps or site features require a free child registration. Some apps may be free to download while others may have a cost. Our web sites may contain special sections and privileges, such as certain activities for members that require a free registration. Families can participate in free website activities like Every Kindness Counts, Dream Tree, Ask For A Magic Letter, Lost Tooth Garden, Me Doll Dress-Up, Castle Suite decorating with virtual shopping items, games and other tooth fairy-related activities. Optionally, parents may choose to purchase an Upgraded child membership on the website which offers additional site access and activities. To obtain a paid website membership for your child, a parent inputting their personal credit card information is required. This is the personal information that we typically ask of adult users: first and last name, birth date, credit card billing address, shipping address if different from billing address, phone number and parent e-mail address. We do not collect any personal information from you online or in app unless it is voluntarily provided, such as when registering for contests, sweepstakes, promotions, downloads, or free demos, completing our online customer surveys, filling in statements in certain activities, or purchasing products. If a parent does a free Parent’s Only Zone registration on the website using Facebook for age verification, we only collect your parent name and parent email. If a parent does not use Facebook for age verification when registering for the Parent’s Only Zone, then a one time 49 cent purchase is required, so that we know you are a parent by using your valid credit card.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">We also collect information from you offline if you contact us to request a RCRF catalog or participate in a Real Tooth Fairies promotion, like a sweepstakes or drawing. We may obtain customer lists, demographic and other information from other sources. We may combine this information with information we collect online to better understand your needs, improve our site, our products, and our services, and better serve your needs. We also collect an email address on our Contact Us website page for the purpose of being able to reply to resolve a question or problem experienced by a site user, however that email address is only used for a one-time response to the user’s specific inquiry.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><b>5. What ordering information does Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC collect in the online shopping sites and/or for online purchases?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">We advertise RCRF’s Real Tooth Fairies products on the entertainment website where each ad is marked with the word Ad.&nbsp;We also offer products to purchase in RCRF’s online Real Tooth Fairies Store as well as parent purchases of Magic Letters, Parent’s Only Zone membership (free with Facebook age verification or 49 cents to register as a parent if not verified with Facebook), and children’s Upgraded Memberships for the website. Every purchase online or by phone requires a valid credit card, therefore only adults may purchase products on our site. We offer a paper or printable download Wish List on the website for visitors under age 18 to use for browsing product choices. When an adult places an order or requests a catalog online, we collect information associated with the requested transaction, such as the customer’s name, mailing address, products ordered, shipping addresses, email address, and/or credit card information. We ask for this information so that we may fulfill your order or catalog request. We will send a confirming e-mail message to the e-mail address provided when a customer places a credit card order online.&nbsp;Credit card information is not stored by RCRF for items sold at shop.therealtoothfairies.com or purchases of Magic Letters, VIP Upgrade, or Parents Only Zone membership.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">RCRF has security measures in place to help protect misuse of information under our control. When you make credit card purchases on the shopping website pages, your transaction is secured by use of a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which is an advanced encryption technology that safeguards your personal information. Credit card information is not saved by our online store; it is securely transmitted via a secured third party credit card processor.&nbsp;Notwithstanding, perfect security is never guaranteed.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Parents or other adults have the option of registering certain information for future orders while completing their online website order. For the customers who choose to register during a purchase, we will save their login information (password is not viewable in our customer administrative records unless one is inputting a new password), name, phone and mailing address, alternate ship-to addresses. When applicable, we will record the name of your child’s Real Tooth Fairy or a child name if input during the parent purchase for a personalized product.&nbsp;A customer account will be created when an adult customer has successfully entered all the required information. Customers can access their online account information through the “My Royal Account” feature at our site that will give you access to the Parent’s Only Zone and also your Royal Account menu. We may keep this information in our database for use at later time. When registered online customers return to the site to place subsequent orders, they can identify themselves with an adult login name and password. Be sure to use a password for adult login and registration that your child does not know.&nbsp;The Parent’s Only Zone is accessible only to parents by entering their personal email and password.&nbsp;Each time a parent requests to enter the Parent’s Only Zone, the parent will be asked to enter that email and password as a measure to only allow parents into the parent section of the website.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">With the information of a child’s birth date and the parent e-mail address at registration, this information will be used to help us provide products and services that meet your needs, improve customer service, and help you with options to make your child’s tooth fairy experience more rewarding. We will keep parent information in a database if you request a catalog, online or offline, or sign up to receive promotional e-mails, including as part of a sweepstakes or drawing entry. Unsubscribe to email options are shown in every parent email.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;"><b>6. Will Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC collect any other personal information about anyone under age 13?</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Without ever registering or providing any information, a child can visit certain website areas or apps directed to children. We offer child visitors the opportunity to voluntarily register a free request to use the site through an online registration form that asks only for the child first name, age/birthdate (to validate ages of our guests), a fictional “member name” and password, and a parent email address.&nbsp;Thus, we do not collect any personally identifiable information from a child in our registration process. When a child’s e-mailed or mailed in submission is posted to any area of the web site, we only use the child’s first name and age, and then only with prior written permission by the child’s parent using our online permission form. Likewise, any photographs or videos of children posted on our site are only done with prior written permission from the child’s parent using our online form which parents download and submit.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">We do not collect personal information online on the website or apps from children under 13 without their parent’s consent except in special, limited circumstances.&nbsp;Registered children, whose parents have allowed their child to participate in the site, will have opportunities to voluntarily share their news with their Real Tooth Fairy at the site or in an app, write a Custom Kindness ticket or record kindnesses they did in the Every Kindness Counts program on the site, write about their newest lost tooth, and write about their Dream Tree on the site. Anything written by a child on a site or app activity cannot be viewed by other site users via site activities but can be viewed by parents in Sharemails sent to the parent email address or in the Magic Letter History Page in the My Royal Account page. Parents please be aware that Royal Council of Real Fairyland, LLC cannot control what someone enters in a write-in field in our website or app activities, but do be assured though that we do not allow any site guest other than the child herself or the child’s parent to view any areas of the site or app where a child can write freely in a typed field.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">We do not ask for more information from your child than is necessary for your child to participate in any activity such as RCRF site activities or promotions, like sweepstakes or special contests, which may be open to children even if they are under 13.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">In this situation, we ask the child for the parent’s email so that we may notify you of their activity online. If we need more information than First name/Screen name and birth date, we will contact you directly and ask that you provide that information for your child. We might ask for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your child, any prizes your child wins, or ask you for your telephone number so that we can notify you when your child has won. Any information you or your child give us in these special circumstances will be removed from our database once the promotion, program or activity is finished, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete.&nbsp;Once you are properly identified, parents may review the personal information we have collected online from their child, request we remove any identifying information, or refuse to allow further collection. However, if you ask us to cancel your child’s account from our database, we will ask that you advise your child not to participate in our activities to avoid further information collection.</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">If we collect online contact information from a child under 13 years for the sole purpose of responding directly to a specific request from the child, and if we know it is a child making the contact, such as for help with a website problem, we will not use this information to re-contact the child and will delete the information immediately from our records after responding to the help request.&nbsp;If a child calls our guest services phone line, we will only ask for their first name and fictitious member name to assist with their help request.
