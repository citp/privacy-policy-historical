            in effect January 1, 2011</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">You and your Earthie child’s use of this web site signifies that you accept our Terms and Conditions.<br>
            <br>
            Here at the Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC, we are dedicated  to protecting your online privacy when visiting this web site. We do not  collect and keep any personally identifying Earthie information online  from you unless you volunteer it, and only if you are 13 years or older. We do  not collect and keep personal information online from Earthie children  under the age of 13 years without permission of their parent and/or  legal guardian, except in limited circumstances authorized by law and  set forth in this Privacy Policy. Whenever we reference the term  “parents” below, we intend to include legal guardians. Do note that this  site and in its servers are located in the U.S.&nbsp; By using this site  you agree to the transfer, collection, processing and use of data by  Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC, its affiliates, subsidiaries  and parent companies.<br>
            <br>
            IF YOU ARE AN EARTHIE UNDER 18, PLEASE READ THIS POLICY WITH YOUR  PARENTS AND ASK ABOUT PARTS THAT ARE NOT CLEAR TO YOU. IF YOU ARE AN  EARTHIE UNDER AGE 13 YEARS&nbsp;OLD, IT’S IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET YOUR PARENT’S  PERMISSION BEFORE YOU TELL ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING YOUR  E-MAIL ADDRESS, TO ROYAL COUNCIL OF THE REAL FAIRYLAND, LCC—OR TO ANY  OTHER PARTY ON THE INTERNET. ALSO, PURCHASING PRODUCTS AT OUR ONLINE  STORES REQUIRES USE OF A VALID CREDIT CARD AND CONFIRMATION THAT THE  USER IS OVER 18.<br>
            <br>
            PARENTS, PLEASE NOTE: Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC adheres  to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and the  guidelines of the Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the  Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. in all of our web sites for  children.<br>
            <br>
            Parents, you can support your child’s healthy use of the internet by  spending quality time online with your children and observing your  Earthie children’s online website use by seeing what they write in their words. Our online interactive worlds for  boys and girls offer much family enjoyment and sharing through the  Every Kindness Counts, Real Dream Tree, Ask For a Magic Letter and Faves Page activities.&nbsp; Please  help us protect your Earthie child’s privacy by instructing him or her  to never provide personal information on this site or any other without  your permission. By identifying yourself appropriately, parents may  review their Earthie child’s personal information that we have  collected, request deletion of their information and account, or refuse  to allow further collection or use for marketing purposes. Parents have  the option to receive Sharemails from us, which list for you much of the  content that your child writes and shares with her Real Tooth Fairy or  his Tooth Elff online. Those Sharemails, (which become parent keepsakes  to print and save) keep parents informed as soon as your child writes  about herself or himself online in the Magic Letters, Every Kindness  Counts, Real Dream Tree, and certain Faves Page sections.&nbsp; We offer a  one-of-a-kind experience for parents to easily share in your child’s  online activities by seeing it in their words.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>1. How does the Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC notify Earthie  parents and obtain consent for the collection of information from  children?</strong></p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">Your child’s Real Tooth Fairy sends parents an email called SHAREMAIL  when your child registers and/or takes the Royal Quiz to get matched  up to a girl’s Real Tooth Fairy or a boy’s Tooth Elff.&nbsp; Parents are  provided 48 hours to refuse their child’s registration and/or Quiz  Match, and if the parent refuses, that child’s information is promptly  removed from our database.&nbsp; If the parent doesn’t notify us to refuse,  the Royal Council assumes that the parent approves of the child’s  registration and participation in Real Fairyland online activities.&nbsp; The  Real Tooth Fairies website does not offer online, instant message chat  rooms to children, so parents can be assured that their children are  only interacting with the Real Tooth fairies and the other humorous  characters from Real Fairyland, unless a child elects to email an image  or fill-out activity from our website to a friend.<br>
            <br>
            Parents may unsubscribe from Sharemail or any parent email by clicking the unsubscribe button in the email. On that unsubscribe page click to email the unsubscribe message that is already filled out for you. Another way for parents to unsubscribe from Sharemail (if the parent is  registered in the Parents Only Zone) is to click on My Royal Account and go to the My Profile page. Click on Sharemail and choose your Sharemail preference. Sharemails are to be distinguished from special offer  emails because  Sharemail shares with the parent specific things your  child is  writing about herself on the Faves Page, Real Dream  Tree, Lost Tooth  Pages and Letter Requests to her Real Tooth Fairy.&nbsp; Sharemail also  shows you the Kindness activities your child  has chosen to do in your  family whenever your child picks or records a  new kindness completed. Sharemail can include product information related to your child's online activities that you just read about.<br>
            <br>
            Also in My Royal Account-My Profile, parents will also find the option to access &amp; change your child’s personal  information and change your child's password.  A parent may change your personal information at any time by clicking My  Royal Account and go to My Profile page. <br>
            <br>
            A parent may refuse a child’s participation in our site by going to the  "For Parents" page, accessible to all site visitors and click on the  link "To cancel a child’s participation on this site or a parent member  account, click here." Fax or mail the completed form.&nbsp; You will need  your child’s password and member name. With any additional questions about how to  change or delete the personal information we have gathered from your  child, email your request to Help@TheRealToothFairies.com. <br>
            <br>
            Children have the option to send an email to a friend about the site activty she's doing. Children select pre-approved messages to assure all content is appropriate and safe. In those cases we never save the email address of a child's friend or the message email to the friend.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>2. Will Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC collect personal information about me if I’m 13 or older?</strong></p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">At Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC we don’t require anyone to  share any personal Earthie information about themselves in order to  enjoy the magic of our websites. You may visit our web sites without any  need to register with us. However, our web sites may contain special  sections and privileges, such as clubs and certain activities, for  members that register. Membership in clubs or special online activities  open to Earthie children may require registration by a parent or legal  guardian. Information we require to register and rules or restrictions  are available at all registration areas. This is personal Earthie  information that we typically ask of adult users: first and last name,  birth date, mailing address, phone number and an e-mail address. We do  not collect any personal Earthie information from you online unless it  is voluntarily provided, such as when registering for contests,  sweepstakes, promotions, downloads, or free demos, completing our online  customer surveys, filling in statements in certain activities, joining a  club, or purchasing products. <br>
            We also collect information from you offline if you contact us to  request a Real Fairyland catalogue or participate in a Real Tooth Fairy  promotion, like a sweepstakes or drawing. We may obtain customer lists,  demographic and other information from other magical sources. We may  combine this information with information we collect online to better  understand your needs, improve our site, our products, and our services,  and better serve your very fairy needs.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>3. What ordering information does Royal Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC collect in the online shopping sites?</strong></p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">We offer products to purchase online in our online Real Tooth Fairy  Online Stores. Earthie customers must be over age 18 and have to provide  a valid credit card or other valid payment method accepted by Royal  Council of the Real Fairyland, LLC to purchase products online. We offer  a Wish List for Earthie visitors under age 18 to use while browsing the  online store, but Earthie children cannot make purchases without their  parents. When an Earthie customer places an order or requests a  catalogue online, we collect information associated with the requested  transaction, such as the customer’s name, mailing address, products  ordered, shipping addresses, email address, and/or credit card  information. We ask for this special Earthie information so that we may  fulfill your order or Real Tooth Fairy catalogue request. We will send a  confirming e-mail message to the e-mail address provided when an  Earthie customer places an order online.<br>
            <br>
            Customers have the option of registering certain information for future  orders while completing their online order. For the customers who choose  to register, we will save their Earthie adult login name, password,  name and mailing address, and credit card  information. When applicable, we will record the name of your child’s  Real Tooth Fairy.&nbsp; An account will be created for them online when they  have successfully entered all the required information. Customers can  access their online account information through the “My Royal Account”  feature at our site that will give you access to the Parents Only Zone  and also your Royal Account. We may keep this information in our  database for use at later time. When registered online customers return  to the site to place subsequent orders, they can identify themselves  with an adult Earthie login name and password. Be sure to use a password  for adult login and registration that your child does not know.&nbsp; The  Parents Only Zone is accessible only to parents/adults by entering their  personal email and password.&nbsp; Each time a parent requests to enter the  Parents Only Zone, the parent will be asked to enter that email and  password as a security measure to ensure that only parents enter that  zone.<br>
            <br>
            If a customer includes a child’s birth date and e-mail address, this  information will be used to help us provide products and services that  meet your Earthie needs, improve customer service, and to make your  child’s friendship with her Real Tooth Fairy or his Tooth Elff more  positive and rewarding. We will keep your information in a database if  you request a catalogue, online or offline, or sign up to receive  promotional e-mails, including as part of a sweepstakes or drawing  entry.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>4. Will Royal Council of the Real Fairyland collect any personal information about any Earthies under 13?</strong></p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">Without ever registering or providing personally identifiable  information, an Earthie child can visit our sites or certain areas of  our sites directed to children. We offer our Earthie child visitors  opportunities to tell us about their interests through online forms. We  may invite a child to provide a first name, age, and state when  submitting a response in areas directed to children, which is completely  voluntary and could be entered as fictional answers to protect the  child’s privacy such as using a ‘screen name’ instead of a real name. A  Royal Council editor looks over all the responses we receive and  deletes any personally identifiable information before any of the  information is posted to our web site. When a child’s e-mailed  submission is posted to any area of the web site, we only use the  child’s first name, age, and state. We do not collect personal  information online from children under 13 years old without their parent’s consent  except in special, limited circumstances.&nbsp; Children will have  opportunities to voluntarily share their latest news with their Real  Tooth Fairy, record kindnesses they did in the Every Kindness Counts  program, write about their newest lost tooth, and write about their  dream, talents, achievements, kindnesses, and habits tn their Real Dream  Trees or their Faves Pages. Royal Council of the Real Fairyland might  collect an e-mail address and first name (or screen name) from your  child under 13 years old without your consent online, but only in the following  special instances:</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"><br>
            A. If a child under 13 sends a request to us, we keep a submitted e-mail  address long enough to respond to their request and delete this  information from our system immediately after we respond.&nbsp; If the child asks to send an email to a friend about an activity they’ve participated in online, we use the child’s email and recipient email only to send that requested message to the  child’s friend.&nbsp; Emails to a Friend have prescripted fixed statements to ensure that any email to a friend contains appropriate and safe statements. We also do not save any friend email addresses, once the email is sent, that information is deleted.<br>
            <br>
            B. If we offer an e-mail newsletter or subscription or other activity  that requires multiple online contacts with the Earthie child, we will  only ask for the child’s first name and for that child's parent’s e-mail address so we can notify you and give you an  opportunity to opt out. If you no longer wish your child to participate  in an e-mail newsletter or a downloadable subscription, simply follow  the instructions in the news subscription section to delete your child’s  account.<br>
            <br>
            C. We do not ask for more information from your Earthie child than is  necessary for your child to participate in any activity such as Royal  Council of the Real Fairyland’s magical site activities or promotions,  like sweepstakes or special contests, which are open to children even if  they are under 13 years old.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            In this situation, we ask the child for the parent’s email so that we  may notify you of their activity online. If we need more information  than First name/Screen name and birth date, we will contact you directly  and ask that you provide that information for your Earthie Child. We  might ask for your mailing address so that we can send to you, for your  Earthie child, any prizes your child wins, or for your telephone number  so that we can notify you when your child has won. Any information you  or your child give us in these special circumstances will be removed  from our database once the promotion, program or activity is finished,  and after any legally required period for keeping such information is  complete.&nbsp; Once you are properly identified, parents may review the  personal information we have collected online from their child, request  deletion, or refuse to allow further collection. However, if you ask us  to delete your child’s account from our database, we will ask that you  ask your child not to participate in our activities to avoid further  information collection.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;"><strong>5. Does Royal Council of the Real Fairyland use cookies or gather other information automatically?</strong></p>

But what it will do is help your computer recognize our website; it will  optimize your online experience, and it helps us customize your  experience in Real Fairyland. Cookies help track the items in your  shopping cart and wish list; cookies also remember choices your child  made in activities, so they remain there on the next visit.&nbsp; Cookies  assist us in knowing how many people visit our sites, how long they stay  there, and which pages get the most use.

Your IP address and cookies are not  connected to any personally identifiable or on-line contact information  like a name and address, unless you register or place orders at our  site.&nbsp; Any Earthie who registers at our site will have that information  stored in the Real Fairyland database, and it will be connected with  your Earthie customer file.<br>
            <br>
            In our online advertising activities, Royal Council of the Real  Fairyland, LLC may work with third party network advertisers who use  pixels, cookies, or transparent GIF files.
