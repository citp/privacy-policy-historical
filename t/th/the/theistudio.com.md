# Privacy & Security | At Your Service...

### The IStudio® and Your Privacy

This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for The IStudio®. This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this Web site. It will notify you of the following:

  1. What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the Web site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
  2. What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
  3. The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
  4. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.



### Information Collection, Use, and Sharing

I am the sole owner of the information collected on this site. I only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give me via e-mail or other direct contact from you. I will not sell or rent this information to anyone - ever!

I will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted me. I will not share your information with any third party outside of my organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request(s).

Unless you ask me not to, I may contact you via e-mail in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

### Your Access to and Control Over Information

You may opt out of any future contacts from me at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting me via the e-mail address or phone number given on my Web site:

  * See what data I have about you, if any.
  * Change/correct any data I have about you.
  * Have me delete any data I have about you.
  * Express any concern you have about my use of your data.



### Security

I take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and offline.

Wherever I collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to me in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your Web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the Web page.

While I use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, I also protect your information off line. I am the only person with access to your information. The computers/servers in which I store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment and are password protected.

### Miscellany

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that I am not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. I encourage my users to be aware when they leave my site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.

I use “cookies” on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor’s hard drive to help me improve your access to my site and identify repeat visitors to my site. Cookies can also enable me to track and target the interests of my users to enhance their experience on my site. Usage of a cookie is in **no way** linked to any personally identifiable information.

If you have any difficulties or questions about The IStudio®’s privacy policy, you should contact me immediately via telephone at 662-560-6956 or via [e-mail](http://www.theistudio.com/muse/contact/).
