Consumers' Privacy Rights   
MGON International AB holds the consumer relationship in the highest regard and pledges: 

To ensure that consumers have the ultimate right to control dissemination of their personal information. We support the self-regulation efforts of the direct marketing industry and believe this action is the best way to protect consumer privacy. We support legislation and regulatory efforts, which introduce fair, workable guidelines that protect the privacy of consumers. We will work to ensure that any such guidelines are consistent with and complement established self-regulatory measures, and that they allow the consumer to continue receiving the benefits that sophisticated marketing techniques can provide.

To respond quickly to questions about the accuracy of information we process for our customers. We appreciate the fact that inaccurate data can have a negative impact upon consumers. If a data error is called to our attention, we will use our best efforts to determine the source of the error and to notify the responsible party and update our records. If the error is in data, which originates with us, we will promptly correct it. 

To monitor privacy issues and assure that any changes in legislation or industry standards regarding privacy issues are reflected in our Privacy Policy. MGON International AB has appointed an executive level Privacy Committee, which uses a variety of resources to stay informed about changes in legislation and regulation. We are in constant contact with our network affiliates to identify and resolve misunderstandings about the law, industry standards or our Privacy Policy. 

To maintain strict data security systems that ensure specific individual information will not be made available to any unauthorized person. We use a multi-level security system to control access to information stored for our customers. We also provide stringent physical security and only provided access to authorized personal.
