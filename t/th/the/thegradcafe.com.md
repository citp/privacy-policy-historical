Survey and Results

theGradCafe.com in no way assures the accuracy of the results within the survey. It is by an “honor system” that entries are submitted, and while we will do our best to delete double entries from the same user, we will in no way contact programs to determine accuracy. By participating in the survey through viewing results or submitting them yourself, you agree with the fact that the information submitted is not confirmed as correct. We reserve the right to delete any entry we find to be misleading or abusive, and we also reserve the right to edit comments left on the survey.
