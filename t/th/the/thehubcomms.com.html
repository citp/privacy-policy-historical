    <h2>US Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>       
            Haymarket Media Inc. ("Haymarket") has created this privacy statement to demonstrate
            our firm commitment to protect your privacy and to fully disclose what information
            we collect and how we use it. Please note your use of our Digital Offering is also governed
            by the Terms and Conditions of use.
    </p>
    
    <p>
         <strong>Information Collection and Dissemination </strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>General Principles </strong>
    </p>
    

   <ul>
        <li>
                In general, you may visit this Digital Offering or use the companion mobile applications (collectively referred to as the "Digital Offering")without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.
                 
            </li>
        <li>
            As you browse our Digital Offering, the Digital Offering collects
                log file, IP address of your computer, and other standard tracking data we use to
                evaluate Digital Offering traffic and usage patterns. Such information is aggregated with tracking
                data from all Digital Offering visitors. We will use the information to personalize the Digital Offering
                according to your preferences based on the aggregated information. We also use the
                aggregated information to evaluate products and services we may offer to you.
               
            </li>
        <li>Some portions of this Digital Offering may require you
                to give us personally identifiable information such as your name, job title, company,
                physical mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers (Personal Information)
                and, if applicable, financial information such as your credit card information (Financial
                Information), for, without limitation, (i) registration for attendance at certain  Haymarket trade shows, conferences and events; and (ii) subscriptions to our publications.
                If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin
                boards or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries,
                any information provided in such communications may be collected as Personal Information.
               
            </li>
        <li>If you elect to provide us Personal Information,
                we use it primarily to deliver the service you requested. Other uses of Personal
                Information are described elsewhere in this Policy.</li>
        <li>If you submit Financial Information, we use that
                information primarily to verify your credit and collect payments for your purchases,
                orders, registrations etc.
               
            </li>
        <li>Haymarket uses a third party to process credit
                card transactions and does not store financial information, such as credit card
                information on its website. We do retain the last four digits of the credit card number solely for customer service purposes. 
                
            </li>
   </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Information Sharing</strong>
    </p>
       
    <p>   
           Unless you opt-out, we share your Personal Information with Haymarket's affiliates and partners and third parties licensed to access your Personal Information 
           by any of the foregoing. To opt-out, send us an email to <a href="mailto:Newslettersupport@haymarketmedia.com">Newslettersupport@haymarketmedia.com</a>
    </p>

    <p>
            Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal
            Information and your Financial Information private and will not share it with third
            parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court order or
            other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) 
            enforce our terms
            of service.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Several companies unaffiliated with
            Haymarket provide email deployment services for our email messages. The personally
            identifiable information, such as e-mail address, we provide to these vendors for
            the purposes of e-mail deployment is only used by them for that purpose and not
            for any other business activity.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to comply with the Federal
            CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide lists of customers who have opted-out
            of email promotion for Haymarket products to other companies, so they can be suppressed
            from mailings those companies send on
            Haymarket’s behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe
            from a mailing we send to our own list
            on behalf of a third party, your removal
            instruction may also be supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression
            file. If you continue receiving email after opting out, please contact us at web@haymarketmedia.com.
        
    </p>

        <strong>Online Ad Serving</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
       We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Digital Offering.
        These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address
        or telephone number) about your visits to this Digital Offering and other Web sites in order to provide
        advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more

    </p> 

    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    
    <p>
    A "cookie" is a bit of data sent by a Web site through the browser to the computer
        of the user visiting the site, and enables the site to return the results the browser
        expects. Haymarket uses temporary, session-specific cookies to ensure visits to
        its Web site are smooth and customized for the visitor. Such cookies allow us to
        provide a visitor's browser with information tailored to the visitor's preferences
        and needs. Haymarket also uses permanent or persistent cookies that remain on a
        visitor's computer after the visitor leaves a Haymarket Web site.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can turn off the cookie acceptance
        option in the browser's settings. However, disabling the cookie support function
        of the browser will prevent our Web site from functioning properly and you may not
        be able to utilize fully all of the site's features and information.
        </p>
        <p>
        We use advertising companies to develop banner ads for our Digital Offering. These ads may
        contain cookies. These companies collect cookies sent to your browser through the
        banner ads and we do not have control or access to this data. Information may be collected from a third party through the use of cookies and web beacons to measure website traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Pixel Tags</strong></p>
    <p>
        Like many web sites, Haymarket may
            also use pixel tags, also known as beacons, spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve
            our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional
            campaigns, as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and response
            measurement. Pixel tags are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based
            applications, also for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement
            pixel tags provided by other companies, for the same purpose. You can disable pixel
            tags by changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or
            there are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most
            advertisements.
      </p> 
      
      <p><strong>Opt-out Option</strong></p>

            will include instructions on how to be removed from Haymarket's promotional e-mail
            list. If you continue receiving
                email after opting out, please contact us at web@haymarketmedia.com.
