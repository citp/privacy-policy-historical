Privacy Policy 

This Privacy Policy applies to _CompassLearning Odyssey_ ® only and not necessarily to information collected by affiliates and/or partners linked to the CompassLearning Odyssey Web site. 

What We Collect 

CompassLearning will collect personally identifiable information to assist your school in monitoring your students' skills development. Some of this information may be gathered by technology, so you may not notice that it is being collected. That information will include your name, grade level, username assigned by our system, school-issued ID or tracking code, class affiliation, and certain information that is collected pursuant to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and similar state and federal laws. We will also collect the work you perform. We may also gather information about you to improve the content on our Web site and in our product and for marketing, promotional, and other reasonable commercial purposes. Such data may include information gathered when you first subscribe to our service or respond to surveys or other requests for information. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it voluntarily or your school provides it. We will not require disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary for participation in our services. 

CompassLearning Campus 

The CompassLearning Campus available at support.compasslearning.com ("Campus") is an online community of teachers, administrators and other school personnel with active agreements with CompassLearning for support of Odyssey and who have licenses to use Odyssey. 

The Campus is a place to discuss how to use Odyssey, tips & tricks, integrating Odyssey into the classroom, etc. The Campus is moderated by CompassLearning. Posts do not require pre-approval, although inappropriate posts, as determined in CompassLearning’s sole discretion, will be removed. 

You post content to the Campus at your own risk. CompassLearning cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share information. Therefore, CompassLearning does not guarantee that the content you post on the Campus will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Any personally identifiable information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of the Campus, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. CompassLearning is not responsible for the personally identifiable information or other content you or other customers choose to post on the Campus. Access to the Campus and all content posted or linked thereon is provided "AS IS" and "WHEN AVAILABLE." We reserve the right to edit or delete any content we deem, in our sole discretion, to be inappropriate or offensive, and to deny comment or participation rights to you or other users who post inappropriate or offensive materials. 

Odyssey Community 

The Odyssey Community available at www.compasslearningodyssey.com ("Odyssey Community") is a discussion forum that is integrated into Odyssey and designed to accompany and compliment the Odyssey curriculum. Access to the Odyssey Community is limited to teachers, administrators and students in a particular class or school with active agreements with CompassLearning for support of Odyssey and who have licenses to use Odyssey. The applicable teacher or administrator who creates a discussion thread, or assigns a CompassLearning-created thread, is considered the "moderator" of that discussion and is solely responsible for defining and maintaining appropriate behavior among participants. 

The Odyssey Community provides multiple tools to help moderators manage participation. Moderators may: approve comments before posting, remove inappropriate posts, limit access to specific discussion threads, and set student access to "read only". A school or district may also choose to disable the Odyssey Community entirely. CompassLearning is not responsible for the content or any Odyssey Community discussions. 

You post content to the Odyssey Community at your own risk. CompassLearning cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share information. Therefore, CompassLearning does not guarantee that the content you post on Odyssey Community will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Any personally identifiable information you submit can be read, collected, or used by other users of the Odyssey Community, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Access to the Odyssey Community and all content posted or linked thereon is provided "AS IS" and "WHEN AVAILABLE." We reserve the right to edit or delete any content we deem, in our sole discretion, to be inappropriate or offensive, and to deny comment or participation rights to you or other users who post inappropriate or offensive materials. 

How We Use Your Information 

Except with respect to material posted on the Campus or the Odyssey Community, CompassLearning maintains all student data, student educational information, and student files as confidential, which guards the privacy of students and families. CompassLearning and/or contractors to CompassLearning use the information collected for assessment (such as scoring), reporting, and other purposes as your school system may require. We may aggregate information without identifying students for internal research and generally to inform the public about the results achieved through the CompassLearning Odyssey Web site. Except as otherwise provided herein, we do not sell or share our student database. We have established strict security procedures designed to prevent personally identifiable student files from unauthorized access. Authorized parties that have access to student information are limited to CompassLearning employees and contractors, school districts and/or the student's immediate family with proper request and identification. 

Some information may pass through third-party suppliers of services (such as Web hosting services) who have been engaged to assist in the delivery of the CompassLearning Odyssey product. In addition, like any company, CompassLearning may acquire or be consolidated with other enterprises, and another enterprise may assume the duties of CompassLearning and so have access to your personal information. 

We may also share aggregated demographic information about our user base with other companies who market our products. This information does not identify individual customers and we do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information. 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and/or to comply with judicial proceedings, government investigations, court orders, or legal process served on us, as well as when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, investigate or prevent fraud or other illegal activities or to prevent breach of CompassLearning’s Terms and Conditions of Use Policy.

Privacy Protection for Children 

CompassLearning urges parents and guardians to discuss with their children restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know and to monitor their children's Internet activities. We strive to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). Please read this [Privacy Policy](http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm) in its entirety to understand what personal information is collected from children on our Web site and how we use such information. We have established and will maintain reasonable procedures designed to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information collected from children, although no assurances are provided. 

No part of our Web site is specifically structured to attract children under the age of 13, except as a student under the guidance and supervision of an adult. Parental/Guardian consent is required in order for any child under 13 years of age to submit personal information to the CompassLearning Odyssey Web site, and before CompassLearning will use or disclose that personal information. Only a parent or guardian may register a child for access to the CompassLearning Odyssey Web site. 

We will provide to a parent or guardian, upon proper request and identification, the following information about their child: (a) a description of the specific types of personal information collected from the child, and (b) the opportunity at any time to refuse to permit us further use or maintenance in retrievable form, or future online collection of personal information from that child. We request the parent or guardian send your request to [ Customer Support](http://support.compasslearning.com/), by U.S. mail, or by facsimile with a sufficiently detailed request for information or notice, referring to contact information below. Certain exceptions may apply to the foregoing provisions, pursuant to COPPA and other applicable law. 

If you are a teacher, school administrator, tutor, or similar party entering information about children, you represent that you have proper authority to submit the child's personal information and you agree to hold harmless CompassLearning from any and all claims relating to the acceptance and use of such information.
