    <p><b>The Sill Website Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p><b>Effective Date of Current Policy: May 14, 2012</b></p>
<p>The Sill Plants LLC, d/b/a The Sill ("The Sill", "we," or "us") operates the website located at www.thesill.com (the "Site").

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:help@thesill.com"><span>help@thesill.com</span></a><span>.&nbsp; </span>This Privacy Policy applies to the services and products offered by The Sill, as well as any other applications, content or features that we may from time to time offer on our website.</p>
<p><b>The Types of Information that We Collect</b></p>
<p>We collect two types of information from visitors of our website: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>If you purchase our products or services, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. This includes contact information such as your name, email address, and shipping address, as well as financial information such as a credit card number and its expiration date. We use the personally identifiable information that we collect for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we also will use this information to contact you.</p>
<p>In addition, if you contact us by email through our website, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence.

Alternatively, if you receive materials from us by email you can make use of the "opt out" provision in our communications so that we know that you no longer wish to receive any materials from us.</p>
<p>Like most websites, our website may incorporate “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, or similar tracking technologies and “cookies” that allow us to track the actions of visitors of our website. Pixel tags and cookies are used to collect non-personally identifiable information, such as the name of your internet service provider, the IP address of the computer you are using, the type of browser software and operating system that you use, the date and time you access our website, the website address, if any, from which you linked directly to our website, the website address, if any, to which you travel from our website, your home page customization preferences and other similar traffic-related information.
