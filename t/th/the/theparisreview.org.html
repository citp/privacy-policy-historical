				<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>We, at The Paris Review Foundation, Inc. (the “Foundation”, “we”, &nbsp;“our” or “us”), are committed to protecting the privacy and security of those who visit our website and who purchase products from our Website (as defined in the <a href="/terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>). This Privacy Policy is part of the Terms and Conditions of the Website. This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather on the Website and how we use that information.</p>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information to anyone. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis. By using our Website, or any of the products or resources that we provide on our Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Website.&nbsp; Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept those changes.</p>
<h3>2. Collection and Use of Information</h3>
<p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE?</strong></p>
<p>We collect information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you (“Personally Identifiable Information”), which may include your name, address, email address, telephone number and billing and credit card information.</p>
<p>You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to purchase our products online, such as a subscription to <em>The Paris Review</em> or a book that is available in our online <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/store.php"><strong>store</strong></a> (the “Store”).</p>
<p><strong>WHERE AND WHEN INFORMATION IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE</strong></p>
<p>We may collect Personally Identifiable Information from you in different manners and at different places on our Website, such as when you subscribe to the <em>Paris Review</em> Newsletter or post a comment to a blog entry on the Website.&nbsp; In addition, when you purchase a subscription to <em>The Paris Review</em>, purchase any product from our Store, or make a donation on the Website, Personally Identifiable Information is collected by us and by our third party e-commerce partners Shopify.com and Stripe.com. We will collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>USE OF INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>In general, we use the information collected on our Website to help us understand who uses our Website, to improve our Website, and to collect payments you made in our <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/store.php"><strong>Store</strong></a>. On occasion, we may send you information on new products or upcoming events. However, if you do not wish to receive E-mailed marketing messages from us, please let us know by sending an E-mail to webmaster [at] theparisreview.org or writing us using the contact information on our <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/page.php/prmID/31"><strong>Contact Page</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any information we gather from you on our Website.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if we believe in good faith that we are required by law to do so. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our Website, or the general public.</p>
<p>We may employ independent contractors, vendors or suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website or products, such as providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and fulfilling purchase orders. Access to your Personally Identifiable Information by these Outside Contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited functions for us. We also require that these contractors (i) protect the privacy of your Personally Identifiable Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted.</p>
<p>In addition, through our Website, you may be given the opportunity to purchase (or obtain more information regarding) certain content, products, or services which are sold through a person or company other than us (collectively, “Third Party Sellers”). Third Party Sellers may request that you submit certain information to them in order to purchase their products or services or to obtain additional information from them. By submitting the requested information, you affirmatively consent to have that information shared with the Third Party Seller. This information is used by the Third Party Seller and may be subject to a privacy policy that is different from our Privacy Policy. We do not otherwise share or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to Third-Party Sellers.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Foundation provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We will notify users of any such transfer through notice on our Website and to the extent possible, through E-mail.</p>
<p>If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a comment. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in comments.</p>
<p><strong>DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?</strong></p>
<p>Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by the Foundation. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, privacy practices and performance of those websites. We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other websites and read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected by our Website.</p>
<p><strong>IS THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT SECURE?</strong></p>
<p>We strive to secure transmission of your Personally Identifiable Information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the Personally Identifiable Information you provide via the Internet at the time you purchase any product or donate online, the above mentioned third party e-commerce partners Shopify.com and Stripe.com provide Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) digital security. Only employees who need access to your Personally Identifiable Information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such Personally Identifiable Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee of the Foundation will have access to your credit card information provided through this Website. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>CHOICES THAT I HAVE REGARDING THE COLLECTION, DISCLOSURE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use Personally Identifiable Information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you. You may “opt-out” of receiving other communications by contacting our Postmaster at the address set out below.</p>
<h3>3. General Information</h3>
<p><strong>UPDATING AND CORRECTING YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<p>You can always contact us in order to (1) update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you may receive from us, or (3) delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained about you on our systems, by contacting our Postmaster at the address set out below. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.</p>
<p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us on our systems. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. After receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be promptly updated, corrected, changed or deleted as appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p>
<p>If at any point we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner we deem significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time it was collected, we will notify you by posting changes on our Website in this Privacy Policy, or by email or otherwise, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in the new manner. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p><strong>CONTACT REGARDING PRIVACY QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or feel that we are not abiding by the terms of our posted Privacy Policy, please contact our Postmaster in either of the following ways:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">E-mail our Postmaster <br> webmaster [at] theparisreview.org</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Or, write to our Postmaster at:<br> The Paris Review Foundation, Inc.<br> 544 West 27th Street<br> New York, NY 10001<br> Attn: Postmaster</p>
