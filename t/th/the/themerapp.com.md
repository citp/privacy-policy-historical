  5. #### Use of Cookies

Like most web sites and mobile applications, we use cookies to track site usage, to send you advertisements and to customize your experience of Themer. A cookie is a tiny text or graphics file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us and/or our business partners to recognize you as a user. For more detail on how businesses use cookies on websites, please see www.allaboutcookies.org. You can find an overview of the various types of cookies used by Themer and/or our business partners, in the table below.   
Cookie type | Purpose  
---|---  
Essential Operational | These cookies are necessary to allow us to operate the Themer websites and apps as you have requested. These cookies, for example, let us recognize what type of subscriber you are and then provide you with the services to which you are entitled.  
Performance | These cookies are used by us or our business partners to analyze how the Themer websites and apps are used and how they are performing. These cookies do not let us identify users (as all user data is aggregated). They are also used to monitor when you link from our app to one of our partner apps so that we can check what levels of traffic we are generating for our partner apps.  
Functional | These cookies let us operate certain functions of the Themer websites and apps in line with the choices you make. These cookies mean that we can "remember" you in-between visits – e.g. we will recognize your user name and remind you how you customized our services.  
Targeting/advertising | These cookies are used by us and our business partners to send you advertisements when using the Themer websites and apps and to target those adverts to you and your interests. In doing this our business partners may use the profiles they have developed of other apps and websites that you have previously visited.

  6. #### Sorry kids, over 13s only

We take our responsibilities to the online community very seriously. As such, if you are under the age of 13 we have to ask you not to use our apps or websites in any way. We don't knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 13 and we do not direct any of our products or services at this age group. If we become aware that we have inadvertently captured any personal data about a person who is under 13 years of age, then we will take the appropriate steps to shut down the account of that person.
  7. #### How to access and correct your data (and a special note to Californian residents)

You can update your personal data through the Themer apps and you can ask us about what data we are holding by sending us an email. We will do our best to respond to your request (upon verification of your identity) within a reasonable period of time. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 also permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we disclosed their personal data (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the categories of data disclosed to those third parties. To make any sort of access request, please email or write to us using the details above.
