# ThePRP.com’s Privacy Policy : Theprp.com

#### **What Information Do We Collect?**

We collect information required to give each user an individual user account to post comments and or submit user review ratings on ThePRP.com.

#### **What Do We Use This Information For?**

We use the information received to maintain an individual user account for the end user should they choose to register for one.

#### **Do We Use Cookies?**

Cookies are used should a user wish to maintain a “logged in” status. Cookies may also be employed from time to time in order to better serve our readers with specific advertising, also known as ‘geo-targeting – the process of limiting advertising campaigns to be shown to users from a specific region. Yeah, we’re tech wizards like that

#### **Do We Disclose And Information To Third Parties?**

No, we do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable user information with any third parties. Though we may release information if necessary to comply with the law, enforce site guidelines or protect ours or others rights.

#### **Posting Guidelines**

While we at ThePRP.com are a fairly twisted bunch, do try to avoid any incessant usage of racist, homophobic or otherwise offensive slurs. We’re not prudes, but we’re not about to sanction a hate group either. Let’s face it this is the internet and we can be tolerant within reason, but excessive use may result in your removal.

Please also try to refrain from harassing other users to an extent that they feel persecuted. Failure to do so on either accord may result in the termination of your posting account. Spamming with links, advertising products and other similar behavior will also likely result in termination of your account as well. Please note all user accounts will first need to be manually approved by our staff before being enabled to fully comment.
