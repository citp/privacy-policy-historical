# The Yeogiyo | Privacy Policy

We assure you that when it comes to collecting personal information on TheYeogiyo.com, we have absolutely no need or interest in distributing it elsewhere, so we just won't.

  
We collect information for a few reasons, and we'll honestly tell you why we do this.

  
First, is to determine who you are so that we can better serve you — this means that if you sign up at TheYeogiyo.com and are honest about who you are and what you're interested in seeing, we'll be able to meet those needs. Otherwise, it's hard for us to get a good grasp of who might be visiting our site. If you don't feel like offering all of your information, you don't need to and that's fine by us too.

  
Secondly is to tell our advertisers who is visiting ' hold on, not so fast — we really aren't giving them any information that might lead to who you actually are. We might tell them the general ages, locations and occupations of our users, but frankly, we're spammed out and we're sure you are too. Even the offer of a free, cute baby would not sway us from our commitment to keep any other information you give us locked away tight. 

  
When it comes to information that you might have to give us to book travel, you can rest assured we're not telling anyone else for any reason. It might feel uncomfortable to you to give up information that involves your passport, credit card, birthday-|and we know that. If you'd feel safer telling us over the phone, by all means, do. If you'd feel safer telling us in person in a dark alley, we'll meet you there. We don't expect you to trust us, but please know that you can if you need to, and we have references all over the place to vouch for us if you have any hesitancy. Please do not worry about asking us to prove our integrity — you won't hurt our feelings (and not because we don't have them!).

  
In the interest of full disclosure, we're also checking where you're coming from — if you're living in Bulgaria and logged in to the site, we might just know that. That doesn't mean we know where you live though — but we'd like to if you're having a party. 

  
We are a legal, licensed business and we have the utmost respect for your personal information.
