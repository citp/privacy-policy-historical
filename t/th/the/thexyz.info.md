PRIVACY OF YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS

We use encrypted SSL connection to process your credit card information and DO NOT store any of your payment details in our system. The payments are carried out in the background by the PayPal payment processing gateway and go through the HSBC bank’s terminal. Working with the two leaders in online payment operations, we guarantee fast and secure processing of your payment. Not only do we NOT make a record of your credit card details in our system, but also – for maximum online security – we do NOT share this information with any third party.

PRIVACY OF YOUR ACCOUNT  
We consider your registration data and the content of all your messages private and confidential. Our ad-free webmail does not have any tracking built into it. We do not participate in, or co-operate with, any kind of blanket surveillance or monitoring. We also take technical measures where feasible to prevent surveillance of our users occurring without our co-operation, such as:

  * ensuring encrypted access for webmail, IMAP and POP.
  * using [Perfect Forward Secrecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy) where possible for encrypted connections.
  * using encrypted SMTP for sending your mail when the receiving server supports it.
  * encrypting email while at rest on our servers.
  * encrypting communications between our data centres.



The header of the messages that you send will contain your name (e-mail address) and Internet Protocol (IP) address. We will not monitor or disclose any of your email content or registration data unless we are required to do so: by law, to defend ourselves in any legal action, or to protect our property. Unless prohibited by law, we will disclose to the account holder when we receive a warrant for their account.

Since your password is essential for protecting your privacy, we encourage you to NOT share it with anyone and change it frequently. Additionally, you agree to respect the privacy and confidentiality of others.

PRIVACY OF YOUR REGISTRATION DATA  
Thexyz collects certain information during the registration process. The personally identifiable information that Thexyz collects includes first and last name. Thexyz also collects non-personally identifiable information, such as country, age, gender, etc. You may update your Registration Information at any time from your Web Hosting Control Panel – > My Account – Change Login Credentials section. 

We may disclose aggregate registration statistics in connection with our marketing activities.

WHY WE NEED THIS INFORMATION  
Your registration information is needed in order for us to operate the site, to provide support for your account, for statistical purposes, etc. Thexyz will NOT send you any unsolicited information, including e-mails, except as mentioned hereby.

New customers will receive a Thexyz welcome e-mail containing information about the features provided by the Service, as well as WHCP (Web Hosting Control Panel) and FTP login details.
