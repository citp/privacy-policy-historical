# Privacy & cookie policy | The Pensions Regulator

## What is a cookie?

Cookies are small pieces of information sent to your computer or other device when you visit a website. We use cookies to store information which we can access when you visit our site in future.

We do this to:

  * improve your experience of some of our online services
  * improve our understanding of how people use our website
  * measure the effectiveness of online advertising.



We will not use cookies to collect personal information about visitors to The Pensions Regulator website.

If you delete cookies or you set your browser not to accept cookies, you will not be able to use some of our services.

## Why are cookies necessary?

When we provide services we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, your computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.  
These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
  * recognizing that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.



You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through  
'[Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them](http://www.direct.gov.uk/managingcookies "Internet browser cookies - what they are an how to manage them on the DirectGov website")‘
