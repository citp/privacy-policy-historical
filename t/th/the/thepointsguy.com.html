<p>PRIVACY POLICY / YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</p>
<p>Last updated: December 16, 2013</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share information when you use our Services.<br>
The terms “we,” “us,” or “our” mean The Points Guy, a Delaware corporation, and its legal subsidiaries<br>
and affiliates. The term “Services,” means, collectively, various websites, applications, widgets, email<br>
notifications and other mediums, or portions of such mediums, through which you have accessed this<br>
Privacy Policy. By accessing or using our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation,<br>
storage, disclosure and other uses of Your Information (collectively, “Use of Your Information”) as<br>
described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Your Information” means information about you, which may be<br>
of a confidential nature and may include personally identifying information, medical and health history<br>
information, and/or financial information.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to our Use of Your Information as a result of you using our Services, and does<br>
not apply to the following:</p>
<p>• Information collected through mediums other than our Services;<br>
• Information collected through our Services where a separate privacy policy applies, such as a sweepstakes<br>
entry (you should refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each individual</p>
<p>sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry); or</p>
<p>• Information collected by any person or entity other than us, even if related to our Services (such as a third-party<br>
website, application, widget or lead form).</p>
<p>In addition to this Privacy Policy, our Services are also governed by our Terms of Use and any other<br>
documents referred to in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. These documents describe<br>
information that we collect from you or that you provide on or to the Services and how Your Information<br>
may be used and disclosed by us. They also describe the choices available to you regarding our Use of<br>
Your Information and how you can access and update Your Information. Please read this Privacy Policy<br>
and the Terms of Use carefully.</p>
<p>Information We Collect and Receive About You<br>
We might receive or collect several types of information about you, such as the information described</p>
<p>Information You Provide</p>
<p>The following are situations in which you may provide Your Information to us:</p>
<p>• When you fill out forms or fields through our Services;<br>
• When you sign up for any newsletters or other materials through our Services;<br>
• When you provide information to us through a third-party application, service or website;<br>
• When you communicate with us or request information about us or our Services, whether via<br>
• When you participate in online surveys;<br>
• When you participate in any of our marketing initiatives, including, contests, events, or<br>
• When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.</p>
<p>Information Third Parties Provide</p>
<p>We may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as from social media websites<br>
(i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), blogs, other users and our business partners.</p>
<p>General Use and Preference Information</p>
<p>We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details<br>
of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that<br>
you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type, and your device type), as well as your<br>
preferences.</p>
<p>Device Information</p>
<p>When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may collect<br>
information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type,<br>
operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information<br>
about your use of our Services, such as date and time. In addition, we may collect information regarding<br>
application-level events and associate that with your account to provide customer service. We may also<br>
collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and<br>
application data caches.</p>
<p>Location Information</p>
<p>If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may collect information about<br>
your actual location, such as your mobile device’s GPS coordinates. We may also use other technologies<br>
to determine your location (such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or<br>
obtain your location information from third parties.</p>
<p>Phone Numbers</p>
<p>We may collect your phone number in several ways. For example, we may collect your phone number:<br>
(i) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services; (ii) by capturing your phone number if you<br>
call us; or (iii) if a third party provides your phone number to us.</p>
<p>Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers</p>
<p>We and third parties use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services,<br>
including sending cookies, pixel tags or other anonymous identifiers to your device. “Cookies” are pieces<br>
of data stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. A “pixel tag” is a type of technology<br>
placed within a website or email for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often used in combination<br>
with cookies. Other “anonymous identifiers” are random strings of characters used for the same purposes<br>
as cookies, such as with mobile devices where cookie technology is not available. These technologies<br>
help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand<br>
when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services.<br>
The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine<br>
your identity. Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally<br>
identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you). If this happens, we will treat the combined<br>
information as personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Please note that, in most cases, you can remove or block cookies (such as by using the settings in your<br>
browser), but doing so may affect your ability to use our Services.</p>
<p>The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other third party assets<br>
(such as social media) on the Services is not covered by our Privacy Policy. These third parties may use<br>
cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our Services. We do<br>
not have access or control over these technologies.</p>
<p>How We Use Information</p>
<p>We may make Use of Your Information for various lawful business purposes. Among others, these<br>
purposes may include using Your Information to:</p>
<p>- Engage in customer support. For example, we might confirm and complete transactions<br>
requested by you, verify information you provide to us and provide you with administrative<br>
notices.</p>
<p>- Contact you and provide you with information. For example, we might provide or contact you<br>
through telephone, email, postal or other communications with Service updates, promotional<br>
materials, surveys, offers, quotes, personalized information and other information from us or our<br>
business partners.</p>
<p>- Analyze, improve and manage our Services and operations. For example, we might obtain<br>
feedback regarding our Services, understand and anticipate your needs and preferences, better<br>
understand your use of our Services, customize and tailor Service content and advertising,<br>
improve our marketing and promotional efforts, engage in statistical analysis and provide<br>
feedback to our vendors, advertisers and other third parties.</p>
<p>- Resolve problems and disputes, and engage in other legal and security matters. For example,<br>
we may use Your Information to comply with, monitor compliance with and enforce this Privacy<br>
Policy, our Terms of Use and any other applicable agreements and policies, meet other legal and<br>
regulatory requirements, and to protect the security and integrity of our Services.</p>
<p>How We Disclose Information</p>
<p>General Disclosure of Your Information</p>
<p>We may disclose Your Information:</p>
<p>- To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive Your Information as<br>
your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (for example, your<br>
attorney);</p>
<p>- To our third-party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and business<br>
operations, including for the handling of data processing, data verification, data storage, surveys,<br>
research, internal marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing and transaction materials,<br>
and our Services’ maintenance and security. These companies are authorized to Use Your<br>
Information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are contractually obligated to<br>
keep Your Information confidential;</p>
<p>- To third parties such as insurance providers when you use our Services to request a quote,<br>
services, or information from one or more of those third parties (“Requested Service Providers”),<br>
such as by clicking “get your quotes” or other similar buttons at the end of a form;</p>
<p>- To third parties when you engage in certain activities through our Services that are sponsored<br>
by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by a third party, electing to receive<br>
information or communications from a third party, or electing to participate in contests,<br>
sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored, in whole or in part, by a third party. When<br>
we disclose Your Information to these third parties, Your Information will become subject to the<br>
information use and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by<br>
this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of Your Information;</p>
<p>- To third parties that are interested in contacting you or providing offers to you that may be related<br>
to our Services or about products or services you may find of interest;</p>
<p>- As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative agency;</p>
<p>- As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are violating any applicable<br>
law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering with another’s rights or property, including,<br>
without limitation, our rights or property;</p>
<p>- If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or<br>
national emergency;</p>
<p>- To enforce our Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and<br>
policies;</p>
<p>- To enforce or protect our rights;</p>
<p>- In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see Business Transfers below); and</p>
<p>- To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or management with us).</p>
<p>If you do not want Your Information shared as described above, then you should not<br>
provide us with Your Information.</p>
<p>Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers</p>
<p>As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service Providers when you<br>
use our Services to request a quote, services or information from one or more third parties<br>
(a “Request”). IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY<br>
CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, TEXT MESSAGE, FAX,<br>
EMAIL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION. YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING<br>
CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST THROUGH OUR SERVICES,<br>
EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT<br>
CALL REGISTRY.</p>
<p>If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Service<br>
Providers conducting any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request. Requested<br>
Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such research. As an example, if<br>
you request insurance quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance<br>
application. Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance<br>
and the price you may be charged for insurance. Consumer reports may also be used for updates,<br>
renewal or extensions of this insurance. In addition, insurance companies may use third parties in<br>
connection with the development of a “insurance score” for you. If you do not want Requested Service<br>
Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a quote for your Request, then you<br>
should not submit a Request.</p>
<p>Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share Your Information as<br>
described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the opportunity to opt out of<br>
the disclosure of Your Information in connection with that Request.</p>
<p>Aggregation and De-Personalization</p>
<p>We may take Your Information and de-indentify it either by combining it with information about<br>
other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information about other individuals), or by<br>
removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to<br>
you (de-identifying Your Information). We reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise<br>
disclose such information to third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose, without notice or<br>
compensation to you.</p>
<p>Sharing with Friends</p>
<p>If the Services contains any functionality allowing you to send content to a friend, then please be aware<br>
that: (a) we may display your email address to your friend; and (b) we may use information you provide<br>
about your friend to facilitate the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Sweepstakes</p>
<p>If you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we reserve the right to share,<br>
loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose the information that you submit with third parties at any time, for any<br>
lawful purpose without notice or compensation to you. Participation in these sweepstakes is completely<br>
voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose Your Information. Please refer to<br>
the official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding<br>
information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes entry.</p>
<p>Circumvention of Security Measures</p>
<p>We cannot ensure that Your Information will only be disclosed as described in this Privacy Policy. No<br>
method of transmission or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee<br>
absolute security. Additionally, by way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to<br>
disclose Your Information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties<br>
may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, notwithstanding<br>
anything to the contrary within this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or any other applicable agreement<br>
or policy, you use our Services at your own risk and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not<br>
expect, that Your Information will always remain private. In the event that an unauthorized third party<br>
compromises our security measures, we will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly<br>
caused by an unauthorized third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate Your information.<br>
Business Transfers</p>
<p>We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or transfer Your Information<br>
collected through our Services, and any of our databases, together with any personally identifiable<br>
information contained in such databases, to third parties in connection with a Business Transfer. A<br>
“Business Transfer” means a share or asset sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-<br>
off, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our affiliates, even if the Business Transfer<br>
is only being contemplated and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole<br>
of our business. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part<br>
of our business, equity, and/or assets (including our Services) to an affiliate or independent third party at<br>
any time, for any lawful purpose, without compensation to you.</p>
<p>Children’s Information</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years of age to register with or use certain portions of the Services. The<br>
Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under 13 years of age may<br>
provide any personal information to or on the Services. We do not knowingly collect personal<br>
information from children under 13. If you believe that we may have any information from or<br>
about a child, please contact us at webmaster@bankrate.com.<script type="text/javascript">

<p>Network Advertising</p>
<p>From time to time, we may participate in or use advertising networks, such as third-party<br>
advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms. We may use<br>
these third-party advertising networks for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as<br>
well as to serve advertisements to you. Advertising networks often gather data about consumers<br>
who view advertisements to make inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences,<br>
which enables their computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s<br>
specific interests. This practice is often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.” For<br>
example, a third-party advertising network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the<br>
type of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or<br>
not you visit specific pages of a website, the location of your Internet service provider’s presence,<br>
the date and time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and a website.<br>
Please see the “Online Behavioral Advertising” subsection of Choices About How We Use and<br>
Collect Your Information below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party advertising<br>
networks from collecting information about you.</p>
<p>User Generated Content</p>
<p>We offer publicly accessible blogs and other interactive media through our Services. To request removal<br>
of Your Information from our blog or community forum, contact us at webmaster@bankrate.com.<script type="text/javascript">

some cases, we may not be able to remove Your Information, in which case we will let you know if we are<br>
unable to do so and why.</p>

a comment. We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog. You will need to<br>

<p>You are responsible for any content, including personal information, that you contribute to be published<br>
or displayed (“posted”) on our Services, or that you transmit to other users of our Services (collectively,<br>
“User Generated Content”). Your User Generated Content is posted on and transmitted to other users<br>
of our Services at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of our Services with whom<br>
you may choose to share your User Generated Content. We are not responsible for circumvention of<br>
any privacy settings or security measures of our Services. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee<br>
that your User Generated Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. You understand and<br>
acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your User Generated Content may remain viewable in<br>
cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Service users. Proper access<br>
and use of information provided through our Services, including User Generated Content, is governed by<br>
our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Social Media Widgets</p>
<p>Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button or interactive mini-<br>
programs that run on our Services. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are<br>
visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Your interactions with these<br>
features are governed by the privacy policy of the third party providing it.<br>
Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</p>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. Below are<br>
some mechanisms that provide you with control over certain information:</p>
<p>- Cookies. If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies,<br>
or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of our<br>
Services may then be inaccessible or may not function properly.</p>
<p>- Email Offers from Us. If you do not wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us, you can<br>
opt out of receiving email information from us (other than emails related to the completion of<br>
your registration, correction of user data, change of password and other similar communications<br>
essential to your transactions through our Services) by using the unsubscribe process at the<br>
bottom of the email.</p>
<p>- Online Behavioral Advertising. Certain third-party advertising networks that deliver behavioral<br>
advertising are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). You can prevent NAI<br>
member companies from collecting preference data about you by clicking here and following<br>
the NAI’s directions. Note that if you opt out through the NAI, you will still receive advertising. In<br>
addition, if you opt out through the NAI and later delete your cookies, use a different browser or<br>
buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt out choice.</p>
<p>Information You Disclose to Third Parties</p>
<p>You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from third<br>
parties in connection with our Services. All information you disclose to such third parties will be subject to<br>
the privacy policy and practices of such third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and<br>
practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of such<br>
third parties prior to disclosing information to them. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive<br>
communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.</p>
<p>Links to Third-Party Websites</p>
<p>Our Services, as well as the email messages sent with respect to our Services, may contain links or<br>
access to websites operated by third parties that are beyond our control. For example, if you click to<br>
apply for a product such as a credit card through our Services, you may be linked to a third-party website<br>
to complete an application. Links or access to third parties from our Services are not an endorsement<br>
by us of such third parties, or their websites, applications, products, services, or practices. We are not<br>
responsible for the privacy policy, terms and conditions, practices or the content of such third parties.<br>
These third-parties may send their own cookies to you and independently collect data. If you visit or<br>
access a third-party website, application or other property that is linked or accessed from our Services,<br>
we encourage you to read any privacy statements and terms and conditions of that third party before<br>
providing any personally identifiable information. If you have a question about the terms and conditions,<br>
privacy policy, practices or contents of a third party, please contact the third party directly.</p>
<p>Third Party Widgets and Plug-ins</p>
<p>Our Services include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, links to our various social<br>
media pages and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our<br>
Services. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may<br>
set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either<br>
hosted by a third party or hosted directly through our Services. Your interactions with these features are<br>
governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
<p>Operation of our Services in the United States</p>
<p>Our Services are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, Canada or<br>
elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will<br>

consent to this transfer.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to update, amend and/or change this Privacy Policy at any time in our sole<br>
discretion. Amendments will take effect immediately upon us posting the updated Privacy Policy on<br>
our Services. You are encouraged to revisit this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to review any<br>
changes that have been made. The date on which this Privacy Policy was last updated will be noted<br>
