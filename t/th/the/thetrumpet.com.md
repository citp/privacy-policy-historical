**HOW WE USE COLLECTED INFORMATION**

When a visitor provides personally identifiable information to us, the pcg uses it for the purpose for which it was provided at the point of collection (or as obvious from the context of the collection). This includes processing literature requests, sending e-mail newsletters, and communicating with a user who has identified themselves. Those purposes may include follow-up information and promotional offers necessary for providing services to users.

The pcg may share non-personally identifiable information with pre-screened third parties for marketing or promotional purposes. This information is collected through a unique cookie, pixel tag or similar technology and is anonymous to us. See the "Cookies" section to learn more about how that is shared. The pcg uses this information to deliver promotions of our services to website visitors, or users who are similar to website visitors, through a third-party partner.

The pcg reserves the right to disclose personal information, when the pcg believes in good faith that disclosure is legally required, to protect our rights and/or the safety of others.

The pcg restricts access to collected information and requires that it only be used as required for the purposes of fulfilling the services offered by the pcg.

The pcg does not sell or otherwise distribute information to third parties except as previously described.

The pcg retains personally identifiable information for as long as needed to provide service to them, or as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
