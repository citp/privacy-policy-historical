<h2><strong>2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES UBISOFT COLLECT?</strong></h2> <h2><strong>2.1 When you use Ubisoft services</strong></h2> <p><strong>2.1.1 While Browsing Ubisoft websites</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong>&nbsp;Ubisoft uses cookies on the Services. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that web sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies are not intended to include people's names, or other information that is directly identifiable; rather, they are typically used to quickly identify a user's device and to "remember" things about the user's visit. Ubisoft may set cookies for your web browser as you visit our websites, use our products, or visit a website where Ubisoft provides ads, content or analytics. For example, Ubisoft uses cookies to keep track of selected items in your shopping cart on our online store, and to remember your Account identifier. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to shop online or to access certain features of our Services. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" resources for your web browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. In addition to Ubisoft using cookies on our network of websites, Ubisoft may allow certain partners to set and access their cookies on your computer. These companies’ use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not the Ubisoft Privacy Policy. Please review them carefully. For more information about cookies, please see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. You can see the list of companies that may implement and/or access cookies on your computer, mobile or device, and how to opt-out to such cookies (where available) at&nbsp;<a href="https://legal.ubi.com/cookies/" class="uri">https://legal.ubi.com/cookies/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Other passively collected information.</strong> While browsing our sites, Ubisoft may, on its own, or with the help of third party tools, collect non-personally identifiable information concerning your gaming hardware, habits, behaviors and use of our Services.

<p>(d) sending your unsubscribe request to Ubisoft, Inc. Attn: Privacy Rights Administrator c/o Legal Department, 625 Third Street San Francisco, 94107 CA, USA</p>
<p>To access certain Services, you will need to give an additional consent to allow Ubisoft to share some of your personal data with third parties, such as companies or organizations, which provide services and products you may be interested in.

Standing alone, this information is not personal data; however, if Ubisoft combines any of this information with personal data, Ubisoft will treat this information as personal data pursuant to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You can find a list of our partners whose analytic tools and ad serving technologies are used in our Services at&nbsp;<a href="https://legal.ubi.com/cookies/" class="uri">https://legal.ubi.com/cookies/</a>.

<p><strong>2.1.8 Social media and other third parties’ platforms</strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft may also collect personal information on third party social networks, platforms or services.

<p>Ubisoft may work with trusted marketing partners to bring you more useful and interesting advertising content on our Services and on third party sites and services. If the box labeled "Share my information with select parties" box on your Ubisoft Account settings is checked, we may do this by sharing or matching the personal information you have provided us on the Services with the information (which may include personal information) you have provided third party marketing partners. If you do not want Ubisoft to match your Personal Information with trusted partners to tailor ads or other custom content for you on our Services and/or third party sites, you can uncheck this box at <a href="https://account.ubisoft.com/" class="uri">https://account.ubisoft.com/</a> at any time.

<h2><strong>3.1 Legal basis for your personal data collection and processing</strong></h2> <p>Ubisoft processes your personal data, wherever necessary:</p>

<p>- To offer the best possible experience to users, and improve the Services (in-game data analytics, etc). It is in Ubisoft’s legitimate interest to process your data for these purposes.</p>
<p>- To provide you with supplementary services (custom content, etc.). In such case, Ubisoft will ask for your consent before processing your personal data for this purpose.</p>
<h2><strong>3.2 Security</strong></h2> <p>We take your privacy and the security of your personal information very seriously. To protect your personal information, Ubisoft maintains appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided. We use robust security measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse and alteration. We use industry-standard practices such as encrypted communications, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. In addition, we take reasonable steps to assure that third parties who collect personal information on our behalf provide sufficient protection of personal information, in addition to requiring their compliance with this Privacy Policy at all times. Please note, we will notify Users of a data breach pursuant to applicable law<strong>.</strong></p>

If you share a computer with other people, please consider disconnecting from your accounts before allowing others to use your computer. Services may contain links leading to third party websites, such as but not limited to social media sites. Whenever you click on a link leading to a third party’s website, you agree to leave Ubisoft Services as governed by this Privacy Policy, and you understand and agree that Ubisoft does not control such third party’s website. Ubisoft cannot guarantee that third parties’ websites will be governed by the same security and confidentiality obligations. Ubisoft is not liable for the use of your personal data by these third parties. Please consider checking privacy policies of any service provider you transfer your personal data to.</p>
<p>DESPITE OUR REASONABLE EFFORTS TO KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE, NO COMPANY CAN GUARANTEE THE SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF ITS SERVICES, INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA. OUR PRIVACY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE "AS IS" AND UBISOFT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AS TO THE FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR MERCHANTABILITY.</p>
<h2><strong>4. FOR HOW LONG DOES UBISOFT KEEP MY PERSONAL DATA ?</strong></h2> <p>Unless relevant legal provisions mandate a different data retention period, Ubisoft will store your personal data only as long as necessary to process it according to this Privacy Policy. For instance, we may retain certain information after you close your account for a period of time needed to protect Ubisoft from legal claims. In this case, we will archive your personal data during the relevant statutory period of limitations.</p>
<h2><strong>5. WITH WHOM DOES UBISOFT SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></h2> <p>Ubisoft does not disclose your personal data to any third party without your prior consent.</p>
<h2><strong>5.1 Sharing your personal data with Ubisoft affiliated companies</strong></h2> <p>Ubisoft may share your personal information among the Ubisoft group of companies. To the extent that our corporate affiliates and/or technical partners have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2><strong>5.2 Sharing your personal data with third parties</strong></h2> <p>While browsing on Ubisoft websites, or while using Ubisoft Services, external providers may collect your personal data for and on behalf of Ubisoft, and Ubisoft may share some of your personal data with these partners to allow the functioning of the Services. For example, these third parties may help deliver your purchases, provide discounts or offer products, promote the Services, perform electronic payment processing, and any other service that may be required by Ubisoft. External providers must comply with this Privacy Policy when collecting your personal data. These external providers will share your personal data with no one other than Ubisoft, and they may not use your data for their own independent marketing purposes, unless you consent to their privacy policy and terms directly,.</p>
<h2><strong>5.3 Sharing your personal data with government authorities</strong></h2> <p>In accordance with relevant laws, Ubisoft may have to disclose your personal data to a judiciary or administrative entity, whenever such disclosure is deemed necessary for protecting, challenging or enforcing the legal rights of Ubisoft, its Users, or third parties. Unless required by law, Ubisoft will not be required to notify you of any such disclosure.</p>
<h2><strong>5.4 Sharing your personal data in case of mergers</strong></h2> <p>In the unlikely event Ubisoft’s business activities or shares are transferred partly or totally to any third party, such third parties may access your personal data. In this case, Ubisoft may also allow your personal data to be transferred to the acquiring third party.</p>
<h2><strong>5.5 Transfers of personal data to third countries</strong></h2> <p>Please be aware that your personal information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed by affiliated companies, subcontractors and/or Ubisoft partners, located in third countries such as, but not limited to, United States, Canada and China. A list of Ubisoft affiliated companies is available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ubisoftgroup.com/en-US/about_ubisoft/world_presence/world_presence.aspx" class="uri">http://www.ubisoftgroup.com/en-US/about_ubisoft/world_presence/world_presence.aspx</a>. Some personal data recipients are located in countries that are not considered as ensuring an adequate protection level according to the EU Commission. In such case, Ubisoft uses the strict framework of the EU Commission’s approved standard contractual clauses, which are available on the EU Commission website (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_fr">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_fr/</a>), or by request at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@ubisoft.com">privacy@ubisoft.com</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>5.6 Business Information</strong></h2> <p>For practical reasons, we treat Personal Information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity. Personal Information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g. resumes) may be shared with third parties as described at the time of collection.</p>
<h2><strong>6. DOES UBISOFT MAKE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION PUBLIC? WHO CAN SEE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></h2> <p>Ubisoft Services may offer a public profile feature ("Public Profile") that allows you to publish information, including personal information, to the public Internet. Other than as stated on the applicable Public Profile site, the information you upload or input to your Public Profile will default to the privacy level you choose at sign-in, and you can choose to change the privacy settings at any time. By default, certain aspects of the Public Profile are set to "public". Those aspects of the Public Profile that are designated as "public" will be visible to everyone, potentially including people not registered within the Ubisoft environment, and may be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for you. If you post your personal information to a Public Profile, including a video, image or photo, you should be aware that these may be viewed, collected, copied and/or used by other users without your consent.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for disclosure by other users of your Personal Information, including without limitation, videos, images or photos that you choose to make public on the Ubisoft Services. Also, please remember that the Personal Information you provide to us as part of your Public Profile may reveal or allow others to identify aspects of your life that you may not choose to state on your Public Profile directly (for example, your picture may reveal your gender). Certain Services may feature a friend finder tool. By using our friend finder tools, you acknowledge that these tools will help you find your contacts, and will also allow your contacts to associate your Ubisoft Account, other Ubisoft accounts (if any), and related gaming entitlements, including games played on PC, mobile and console platforms with your social networking profile and/or email address. Your resulting friends' list, which may be accessible across Ubisoft’s sites, will be subject to this Privacy Policy. Note that the friends that you choose to include on your friend list may be able to find and/or identify you in the context of different Ubisoft products and Services, and may see the profiles and information you have made visible to them or to everyone. Similarly, Ubisoft may also collect or receive information about you from other Ubisoft users who choose to upload their emails and other contacts. This information will be stored by us and used primarily to help you and your friends connect.</p>
<h2><strong>7. MINORS</strong></h2> <p>Unless stated specifically to the contrary in a given Service, our Services are not intended for children, and Ubisoft will not request any Personal Information from children. For games that are not directed at children but nonetheless likely to appeal to younger players, we take additional steps to limit access to these Services on age grounds, and limit data collection for underage players to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of the Service.</p>
