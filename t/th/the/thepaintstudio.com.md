For example, the information is used to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations, to manage billing and payment processes, to operate the Ace Rewards program, to provide emails, newsletters and other communications you have requested, to administer and fulfill sweepstakes and contests, to conduct audits, to manage our information and financial systems, and to provide customer service. This information also may be used to contact you about sales, product recommendations, special offers and new site features from Ace Hardware and other selected vendors, unless you have opted not to receive promotional communications from us. When you opt not to receive emails, newsletters or other promotional information, we collect and store certain information, such as your email address, in order to comply with your preferences regarding such materials.

#### Information We Collect Through Technologies

Like many online services, we use technologies to collect and store certain other information whenever you interact with our Online Services.

This information is used to analyze and improve the Online Services and to provide our customers with a fulfilling shopping experience.

##### Interest-Based Advertising

We and our ad management partner(s) collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites so we can manage advertising effectiveness and provide you with online advertisements, including advertisements on the websites of third parties not affiliated with Ace Hardware, more likely to be of interest to you. We may use web beacons (also known as action tags, pixels, or transparent GIF files) and similar technologies to help manage online advertising. These technologies are provided by our ad management partner(s) and enable our ad management partner(s) to recognize a unique cookie.
