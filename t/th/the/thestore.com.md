TheStore is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. The following Policy, describes how TheStore collects and treats personal information. By using the Site you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, terms used in this Policy have the same meanings as in our TheStore Terms of Service, accessible at our Site. As used in this Policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our Affiliates within the United States or internationally.

We also want to inform you about your choices regarding information. 

### PART 2: INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION

When you visit our Site, we may collect certain non-personal information such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, pages you visit, type of browser and operating system you are using. When you register or login with TheStore, we may also collect the personal information that you submit such as but not limited to your name, age, gender, address, email address, country of origin ("Registration Information").

We may also collect non-Registration Information from our users, including the number of downloads on the Site, metadata found in comments or captions from the user and profile changes.

We may use “cookies” to better facilitate the use of our online and mobile environments. You may remove or block cookies using your browser settings, but this may also negatively impact your ability to use our Platform. For example, you may have difficulty logging in or using certain interactive features of our Site.

TheStore may utilize Non-Personal Information, i.e. data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, for certain general purposes such as to customize content and advertising, improve services, provide generic research and reporting to internal parties. The following are some examples of the Non-Personal Information: individual behavior, location, gender, age, friend’s behavior and connection, etc. Non-Personal Information will never be handed out, reported or otherwise transmitted to external parties without your permission.

We collect information when you register to join TheStore by logging into an account that you already have with certain third-party social networking Sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter) via our Site. For example, our Site allows you to create an account and login to the Site using your Facebook account credentials through Facebook Connect. If you are not currently registered as a user on the Site and you click on “Sign in Using Facebook,” you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join TheStore.

TheStore may sell, share, or trade Non-Personal Information about the users, including and not limited to age, gender, location, occupation, time zone, language, zip code, area code, etc., for statistical purposes. Each user has choice to agree or decline to use the user’s Non-Personal Information for statistical purposes. The user can always change their decision through settings available at the user’s profile.

TheStore does not sell, trade or share your personally identifiable information with third parties unless we obtain your permission first unless such use is under the following circumstances: 

  * Verify a user’s identity for security purposes.
  * Create and manage your account.
  * Provide customer service.
  * Present services or offers that may be of interest to you.
  * Monitor our users' downloads and changes in profiles.
  * To communicate with you about your transactions, new products and services.

Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, gender, profile photo, free-form biography, location/hometown, website and email address. If you decide to create your User account by logging into a SNS via the Site, you are using the Personal Information you have already provided to the SNS (such as your “real” name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your User account on our Site; the information we collect may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS, so please consult the SNS’s privacy and data practices. For example, by using Facebook Connect, you are allowing TheStore to access the Personal Information in your Facebook account pursuant to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the Site via Facebook.

Only a select number of authorized personnel are authorized to access our servers. Your Registration Information is protected by a unique customer password and user ID, and your password is encrypted. You should not disclose your password information to anyone and you should always remember to log off if using a shared computer. We may retain your personal information for as long as it is required to fulfill our business objective and for as long as it is required by legal requirements. If the user logins to the Site through 3rd party sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and the like, the user is subject to and bound by privacy policies and terms of the 3rd party sites.

Additionally, the personal information collected by TheStore may be stored and processed in a country other than your home country, and such other country may have privacy laws that are less protective than those in effect in your home country. By providing us with your personal information and using the Site, you are consenting to any such transfer of information outside of your home country.

We have taken certain security protections in safeguarding your personal information. However, as with most electronic transactions, no method is 100% safe.

### PART 7: INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER

Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.
