We are committed to the protection of subscriber, customer and community privacy. The Great Courses has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate its commitment to the privacy and protection of your personal information. To better protect your privacy, The Great Courses provides this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used in connection with our The Great Courses Daily Website.

**Information about Us**

The Great Courses Daily Website is operated by The Teaching Company Sales, LLC, 4840 Westfields Blvd., Suite 500, Chantilly, VA 20151-2299 (under the trading name of “The Great Courses”). If you would like information on how to contact us, click Contact Us.

  1. **What Information Is Collected**



The following are the types of information we may collect:

The Great Courses may collect personal information, which shall include but is not limited to, name, telephone number, email address, date of birth, and home or business mailing address, as well as cookies associated with your visits to the Website and other information when you access the Website.

At other times, The Great Courses may collect information that cannot or might not be used to directly identify you, such as browser type, Dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) address, cookie-enabled data, “click stream” data, and similar non-personally identifiable information.  For example, we may aggregate non-personal information about you and other visitors who visit certain areas of our Website. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you.

While we take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our Website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor every personal browser preference. In particular, we have _not_ implemented the necessary program changes to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. As our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this Privacy Policy for further updates on this topic.

Further, our online service providers or business partners and vendors, as well as those third party websites which visitors can link to from our Website, may implement technologies that allow for the collection of personally identifiable information over time and across Websites. We recommend that you review each privacy policy posted on the Websites that you visit to better understand privacy practices on those Websites.

**Electronic Communications**

When you open emails from us or engage in other communication with us, we may log and store such information. We may also keep records of various communications regarding the types of products and services that you indicate are of interest to you via your response to email and text messaging. You will always have the option to opt-out of such communications from The Great Courses Daily by clicking an “unsubscribe” link or replying “STOP” to our text messages.

We will use any number of tools to collect information about you, your computer access points, and the web browser that you use to connect to our Website, including but not limited to “cookies”. “Cookies” are tiny text files that we place on your computer’s hard drive when you visit our Website. We may use cookies to personalize your Website experience. You do not have to accept our cookies and you may delete them after they have been placed on your hard drive.

Our Internet Service Providers and supporting service platform providers may also use other standard web-based technologies to analyze your movements while accessing our Website. The technologies may include analytic solutions, web “beacons,” “pixel tags,” and “clear gifs.” These technologies help us ascertain the effectiveness of our Website and marketing programs, allow us to customize the services offered on or through our Website, and help determine the best use for Website content, and product and service offerings. Some of this information, including the IP address, may be stored on our Internet Service Provider’s server logs, and may be available for extended periods of time.

The Great Courses uses or links to the services of independent companies to provide content and certain services to you, including, without limitation, Website hosting services, third party content linking and distribution services, mobile application providers, and Internet connectivity services in connection with The Great Courses Daily.  We may share your non-personal and personal information with these third parties as necessary to provide these services to you.

From time-to-time you may receive e-mail surveys to vote for The Great Courses you want us to make, to rate the quality of The Great Courses Daily Site or individual course titles, and to tell us what improvements to make to The Great Courses Daily, and our other products and services. We may also use your personal information to notify you of special offers. You may receive e-mails from The Great Courses Daily notifying you when individual courses featured in our print catalogs and newsletters go on sale. These e-mails also make ordering extremely simple—if you see courses that interest you, simply click on the links in the e-mail to find out more.

We may also use your IP address to help protect us and our Internet Service Providers from fraud. Additional uses of your non-personal and personal information will allow us to tailor products and services specific to your needs, to help organize and manage your customer relationship and our business, to conduct business, to provide you with customer and member support, to perform functions that are described to you at the time of collection, and to enforce our Website’s Terms of Use.

We may also use non-personal aggregate information to improve our Website. For example, our Internet Service Providers may report to us that there were a particular number of visitors to a certain area of our Website, or that a certain number of men or a certain number of women completed our registration form in particular areas of our Website. Such information may also be used to analyze the effectiveness of our business and advertising models.

    4. **Shared Information**

We may share your personal information with our Internet Service Providers as appropriate.  We may also share personally identifiable information with outside, non-affiliated third parties that offer products and services that are complementary to our products and services. We may also disclose your personal information as is necessary to: (a) comply with a subpoena or court order; (b) cooperate with law enforcement or other government agency; (c) establish or exercise our legal rights; (d) protect the property or safety of our company and employees, contractors, vendors, and suppliers; (e) defend against legal claims; (f) help with internal and external investigations; or (g) as otherwise required by law or permitted by law.

We use third-party ad serving, analytics, and audience and traffic measurement services.   We may use a third-party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Website or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Website or the use of our Services. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Website and other Websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or Websites you might be interested in.  Audience and traffic measurement services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information from the Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Other companies’ uses of their cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp in order to learn more about the information collection practices and “opt-out” procedures of third-party ad servers we may use.

From time to time, The Great Courses Daily will send you email, catalogs, or other information about other products and services from The Great Courses or The Great Courses Plus.  In addition, we may make our mailing and email list(s) available to carefully screened companies.
