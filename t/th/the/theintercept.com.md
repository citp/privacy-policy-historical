Importantly, we do not control the data collection, use and sharing practices of third parties whose features or content may appear on our Services.

Additionally, if you leave our Services, including through a hyperlink on the Services to a third party service, or access our content hosted on a third party service outside of the Services, you should be aware that third parties may continue to collect information about you.
