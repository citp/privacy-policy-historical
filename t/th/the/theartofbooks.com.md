Information Sharing and Disclosure
   !  ZOOBILEE does not sell, rent, or share personal information about you with other
      people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide services that you have
      requested, when we have your permission, and under the following circumstances:
                  !   We provide the information to trusted partners and affiliates who work
                      on behalf of or with ZOOBILEE. These companies may use your
                      personal information to help ZOOBILEE communicate with you about
                      offers from ZOOBILEE and our marketing partners and affiliates.
                      However, these companies do not have any independent right to share
                      this information;
                  !   We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to
                      establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims;
                  !   We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,
                      prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
                      situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
                      person, violations of ZOOBILEE’s Terms of Service, or as otherwise
                      required by law;
                  !   ZOOBILEE may display targeted advertisements based on personal
                      information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume
                      that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the
                      targeting criteria.
                  !   ZOOBILEE will not provide any personal information to the advertiser
                      when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting
                      with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the
                      advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting
                      criteria used to display the ad.


                  !   We will transfer information about you to our successors and assigns if
                      ZOOBILEE is acquired by or merged with another company, or if
                      ZOOBILEE sells all or substantially all of its assets to another company,
                      or if a controlling interest in ZOOBILEE is transferred or sold to another
                      company. In this event, ZOOBILEE will notify you before more
                      information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a
                      different privacy policy.
