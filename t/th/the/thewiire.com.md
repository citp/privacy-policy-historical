# Privacy Policy

---  
By The Wiire   
  
At The Wiire, we strive to bring readers current and accurate news, information, and media relating to Nintendo's Wii. The Wiire is not endorsed, sponsored, nor otherwise affiliated with Nintendo. We recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use our services, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. If you have any questions or concerns about this Policy, you may contact us [here](http://thewiire.com/contact).

  


### Data Collection

  * **The Wiire will never rent, share, or sell any information you provide to us with any other people, websites, or companies, unless compelled to by law.**
  * The Wiire, its forums, and other website services do not collect any personally identifiable information when viewing in a read-only mode.
  * The Wiire automatically collects limited non-personally identifying information your web browser makes available whenever you visit a page on our website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your web browser. We use this information only to develop and improve our services.
  * Some of our website services require you to register for a free account. By registering for an account, users are granted the privilege to post their own information, comments, and opinions onto our message boards, provided that they follow the Terms of Service.

  


### The Wiire Website Account

  * When registering for an [account](http://boards.thewiire.com/index.php?act=Reg&CODE=00), the following information is required: a username, a password, and a valid e-mail address. Your e-mail address can be optionally used for administrative contact, and for contact from other site members. You can choose whether to receive such e-mails from administrators or site members during the registration process.
  * Registering for a website account does not grant the user unlimited or unrestricted access to The Wiire. Certain administrative functions are hidden for security purposes, and may not be accessed by standard users. Attempting to access or otherwise manipulate these administrative controls will have your account temporarily or permanently suspended. By registering for an account, the user must also comply with the The Wiire Terms of Service (see below).

  


### The Wiire IRC Chatroom

  * The Wiire has an IRC channel available for members and guests to chat live with each other. A Wiire Account is not required to use this service, but a computer with either Java or an independent IRC client installed is.
  * All of the rules in The Wiire Terms of Service apply to this chatroom. Any user spamming, insulting, or otherwise being disruptive may be kicked and/or banned from the channel.
  * The IRC channel can be either accessed from a standalone IRC client (available at **irc.wyldryde.org #thewiire** ), or by visiting [this page](http://www.thewiire.com/irc/ "The Wiire IRC"). (Java required)
