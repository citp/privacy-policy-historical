**COOKIES POLICIES**

Our site uses so-called cookies (simple and secure files saved by the site on your computer or other access system to save preferences like login information) that will be reused for subsequent site accesses. Cookies can be classified into four different types:

  * Cookies for site functions: they allow the full navigation in the site using all functions made available by the site to the customer such as, for example, the shopping cart or wish list;
  * Cookies to study analytical site data: these are used to study and analyse user behaviour in the site and to understand the relevant use methods, in order to constantly improve site features and functions.
  * Cookies for preference settings: they allow you to customise navigation, setting preferences or settings that you set while on the site (for example, user name, language, nation, language, etc.) to improve your shopping experience, making it easier and more personalised.
  * Retail cookies: these are used to convey significant sales content to site users. The number of promotional message hits by the same user is managed with this type of cookie, simultaneously measuring our communication campaign effectiveness.



Site access and page navigation require the user and/or customer's acceptance of the use of different types of cookies: the customer thus provides consent when site cookies are entered and saved in the browser tool used and at their use for subsequent site access.

All data collected on traffic, visits, preferences, wish lists, sales and any other sales information that can be used by us or third parties employed by us for this reason shall not contain any reference that can in any way be traced to the specific user or customer.

Brefiweb S.r.l. may use the preferences and personal information for internal marketing analyses to monitor and analyse user behaviour on the site, in order to constantly improve site architecture to increasingly meet customer expectations and needs.

Brefiweb S.r.l. reserves the right to employ third parties to collect and analyse information regarding user behaviour and use methods in the site: in these cases, Brefiweb S.r.l. guarantees the user and customer the full observance of that set forth by the privacy code, requiring its partners to subscribe to stringent privacy agreements and the observance of precise data use instructions.

Brefiweb S.r.l. agrees not to transfer or transmit personal user and/or customer data to third parties for sales purposes.
