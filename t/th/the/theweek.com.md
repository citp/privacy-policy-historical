Your Privacy Rights

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THESE SERVICES.

LAST UPDATED: March 20, 2012

As used herein, "Services" refers to theweek.com (including web sites designed to be accessed by browsers using Wireless Application Protocol) and other web sites on the World Wide Web or mobile applications developed for tablet devices, smartphones or other mobile electronic devices, originating in the United States, which are owned and/or operated by The Week Publications, Inc. and/or Felix Dennis (collectively, "The Week").

By using these Services, or by obtaining a subscription to the print magazine The Week (the "Magazine"), whether through the Services or otherwise, you indicate your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you are not permitted to access these Services or to subscribe to the Magazine, and you should not do so.

The Week reserves the right to change or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes or updates are effective immediately after The Week gives notice of the change or update, which The Week may do by posting to these Services, or by e-mail or conventional mail, and/or by any other means, which provides reasonable notice. Your use of these Services, or subscription to the Magazine, after such notice is posted means that you accept these changes or updates.

The Week understands and respects your desire for privacy. To that end, we would like you to know how we use the personal information you provide to us.

INFORMATION COLLECTION

We (both directly and through third parties) collect personally identifying information when you register for the online newsletters, subscribe to the Magazine (whether through the Services or otherwise), download our mobile applications, enter contests, or participate in other interactive online activities (e.g., surveys, providing comments, participating in social media, or games) throughout these Services. This personally identifiable information may include your name, street address, city, state, zip code, e-mail address, landline phone number, cell phone number, and other identifiers that permit the physical or online contacting of a specific individual. As described below, we may use such information to award prizes or, as described below, for promotional and marketing purposes. We also collect non-personally-identifiable information (such as your IP address or domain, or information about your use of the Services) both directly and through third parties, including through the use of Web beacons, for purposes of administration, targeting advertising and to compile aggregate information about usage of the Services.

From time to time, we may use personally identifiable information to offer promotions, products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, or combine information we receive online with our outside records to enhance our ability to offer you promotions, products, programs or services that may be of interest to you. From time to time, we also may make personally identifiable information available to other companies to offer promotions, products, programs or services that may be of interest to you. To the extent that we obtained your personally identifiable information from your use of the Services, such offers will be made only with your permission, granted at the time that you provided such information. To the extent that we obtained your personally identifiable information from your subscription to the Magazine, your permission shall be assumed from your subscription. In either case, however, you may revoke your permission in the manner set forth below.

You will be asked for your credit card information if you subscribe to the Magazine or buy any other product from the Services. Your credit card information, along with the personal identifying information you submit, is transferred to and used by third party financial institutions to verify the credit card numbers and to authorize the processing of the transaction. Be sure to review all privacy policies published by our third party service providers and contact them directly if you have questions as they may have privacy terms that differ from The Week's Privacy Policy.

These Services have implemented appropriate safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and to make proper use of the information that we collect. However, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your personal information, The Week cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any information you provide to us.

HOW WE USE INFORMATION

We may use the information you provide about yourself or others to fulfill requests for our publications, products or services, to respond to inquiries about offerings and to offer other products, programs or services that may be of interest.

We may combine information we receive with outside records and share such information with third parties to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. We may disclose personally identifiable information to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement (e.g. other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases and non-profit organizations) that want to market products or services to you.

In addition to the foregoing, The Week may share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals when:

\- We utilize third party service providers to provide products, services or functions on our behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and not to use your personally identifiable information for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which we hired them;

\- You have entered a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party and you have agreed to permit the third party to share, disclose or otherwise use personally identifying information, in which case the information may be shared with that third party for their use as permitted by their respective privacy policies, including direct marketing;

\- You have subscribed to the Magazine, in which case the information may be shared with third parties for their use as permitted by their respective privacy policies, including direct marketing;

\- We need to protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you owe us, or to comply with legal processes such as subpoenas and court orders and when we believe in good faith that the law requires the sharing of your personal information).

\- We must comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal or regulatory process; or in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the web sites to which this policy applies.

HOW WE USE E-MAIL ADDRESSES

We may use your e-mail address for the following types of e-mail messages:

\- Account Service Communications. We may send you communications related to products and services in which you are enrolled (e.g. subscription and membership communications)

\- Surveys, Contests and Sweepstakes communications, including confirming entries, notifying winners, sharing results or follow-up promotions.

\- Updates and valuable offers. We may send you e-mail account updates, offers for our products and services, requests for subscriptions, as well as valuable offers from our business partners that we send you on their behalf.

\- Email newsletters that you elected to receive.

HOW TO OPT-OUT

To exercise a cost-free option to prevent information from being shared for marketing and promotional purposes with third parties at any time, with respect to the Services or the Magazine, send an email to the address below:

You can also unsubscribe from promotional and marketing e-mails that you receive from one of these Services' partners by typing "UNSUBSCRIBE" (and only "UNSUBSCRIBE") in the subject line in a reply to one of the partners e-mails to you, following the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the e-mail, or by following the partner's Privacy Policy found on its website.

POLICY FOR MINORS

Children should always ask parents for permission before providing any personal information online. No information should be submitted to or posted on these Services by any Minor (a visitor under 18 years of age) without the consent of a parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information about minors on these Services, provide any personally identifying information about Minors, regardless of its source, to third parties, and do not knowingly use such information for any marketing or promotional purposes. Minors are not allowed to participate in contests on these Services.

POLICY FOR ADULT VISITORS

These Services collect personal information from guests over 18 years of age in order to provide guests with a personalized online experience and to provide our advertisers a way to reach the right audience. The Week may share the personal and aggregate information we collect with our affiliates and other Services operated by and for The Week. On a confidential basis, The Week may also share personal information with our corporate affiliates or consultants, or with third parties that perform a particular service on our behalf (such as fulfilling orders or for general site administration purposes). The Week shares aggregate information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. If all or part of The Week Publications, Inc. or its affiliates are sold, merged, or is otherwise transferred to another entity, the information you have provided to these Services may be transferred to such entity as part of that transaction. We may also disclose personal information in response to legal process, such as a request by law enforcement, a court order or subpoena, or to protect the integrity of these Services if we believe that a guest has committed unlawful or otherwise harmful acts.

With the permission of users of the Services 18 years or older, and with respect to all subscribers to the Magazine, information submitted at the time of registration, subscription or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by us and, also with the permission of the user of the Services (which permission shall be presumed in the case of subscribers to the Magazine who do not opt out as provided herein), may be shared by us with companies that have agreed with The Week to use this information only for the marketing and promotion of its products and services.

If any individual submits content for publication, we may publish his or her name and any other information submitted by that individual.

If guests elect to use our "E-mail to a Friend" referral service for informing a friend about these Services, we ask for the friend's e-mail address, and we will send an email in response to the guest's request inviting their friend to visit the Services. This information is stored by these Services solely for the purpose of sending the e-mail.

YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, the "Shine the Light" law, allows California residents to obtain a list of third parties to whom a business has disclosed personal information if it shares such information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, if a business adopts and discloses in its privacy policy a policy of not disclosing customers' personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and by providing a cost-free means to exercise that right.

As stated earlier in this Privacy Policy, personal information submitted at the time of registration with or submission to the Service may be used for marketing and promotional purposes only with the guest's permission; such permission is assumed when you subscribe to the Magazine. Whenever a guest agrees to allow us to collect personal information when using the Service, we provide the guest with an option to prevent such information from being shared for marketing and promotional purposes with third parties. You may exercise a cost-free option to prevent information from being shared for marketing and promotional purposes with third parties at any time by sending an email to the address below:

[theweek@emailcustomerservice.com](mailto:theweek@emailcustomerservice.com)

Because these Services and subscription to the Magazine have a comprehensive privacy policy and provide you with details on how you may opt-in or opt-out of the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes, we are not required to provide you with the third party list.

PUBLIC FORUMS

Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online in social media, chat rooms, message boards, comments or similar posting areas, the information can be reviewed and collected by anyone. Therefore, do not post any information that you do not want to be made available to the general public. The Week is not responsible for unsolicited communications that arise from your postings on these Services.

PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS FROM THESE SERVICES

If you purchase a product or subscribe to The Week Magazine from these Services, information may be collected from you, including your credit card and contact information, for transfer to and use by third party providers of the product. The Week does not retain this information. Unless otherwise stated, The Week does not have any responsibility in connection with such purchases and all transactions and use of any customer information are the sole responsibility of the product provider. Be sure to review the product provider's privacy policy and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy terms that differ from The Week's Privacy Policy.

THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING

We use third party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit these Services. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to these Services and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit the following web addresses:

USE OF IP ADDRESSES

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you log on to the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address, so when a guest requests pages from these Services, our servers log the guest's IP address. The IP addresses of our guests are collected only for the purposes of system administration, security and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, our corporate affiliates or consultants, or with third parties that perform a particular service on our behalf. We do not combine IP addresses with any personally identifying information, nor do we compile any session activity reports by IP address.

USE OF COOKIES

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're online. The use of cookies is an industry standard. You'll find them at most major Web sites.

We use cookies to help us see, which areas are popular and which are not. This helps us to target ads based on guest interests, and also improve and update these Services based on such data as total number of guests and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.

A cookie allows us to store the personal preferences that you set during each visit to these Services, which in turn allows us to speed up your future activities at these Services. Similarly, the stores hosted by these Services usually use cookies to track which products you've chosen to purchase while shopping. Letting cookies do the record keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. If you are a subscriber of The Week Magazine and have registered to access the subscriber-only portion of these Services, an identifying cookie will be placed on your computer. During future visits to these Services, we will only read and retrieve information that we set in a cookie during an earlier visit to these Services.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers when using these Services as well. These Services do not control these cookies, and they are not subject to The Week's Privacy Policy. Advertisers do not have access to these Services' cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of these Services, such as the shopping, subscriptions, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.

If you have any questions or concerns about The Week's Privacy Policy or its implementation, you may contact us at The Week, Privacy Policy, 55 West 39th Street, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10018.
