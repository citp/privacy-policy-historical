**_When making using the TSH LIFE App_**

When you make use of the TSH LIFE App, we collect the following types of data:

  * we use cookies, which we store on your device. Cookies are small text files, and we use the information contained in these files for essential functions in the App and non-essential functions to improve user experience and perform analytics. Analytic services are provided by third parties including AppSee and involve only the processing of anonymized data, which generates generic data such as how many users have downloaded the app.
  * profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g. first and last name, picture, phone number, interests);
  * user content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post publicly within the TSHF LIFE App;
  * your preferred payment method. The payment intermediary will ask you to provide some payment data. We will not process your payment data and/or details;
  * communications between you and TSH. For example, you may send us maintenance requests. We may send you service-related e-mails (e.g. account verification, changes/updates to features, technical and security notices).
  * laundry transactions when using the App to pay for laundry services.
  * when using the TSH bike sharing system TSH will process location data from the user’s mobile device temporarily to ensure that the bike can only be initially unlocked within a permitted radius of the hotel and can only be officially returned within a permitted radius of the hotel. The functionality of the location data indirectly informs TSH that a user is at a hotel when the bike is initially unlocked and officially returned. TSH does not collect or process any location data from the user’s device when the bike is in use. A record of time is kept confirming the time the bike was unlocked and returned to ensure the terms of use are respected. All data will be automatically overridden once the bike has been returned in accordance with the bike terms of use and a new user unlocks the bike.
  * When using the TSH bike sharing system TSH will keep a record of where the bike is locked using the location of the bike lock (not the user’s device), which will only be used if needing to retrieve a bike that has not been returned in accordance with the bike terms of use.

**_After your TSH experience_**

After what we hope is only your first TSH experience we will continue to store your personal data in a profile. Should you return to TSH in the future, we want to be able to offer the best possible service, including the ability to customize your stay based on your previous personal preferences. We will only do this to the extent that we believe we have a legitimate interest to do so which in every case will be to improve the service we can offer to you in the future.

The data collected will therefore be kept for as long as we believe you may return to TSH or until you communicate your right to be deleted.

We will also continue to send you marketing e-mails to keep you updated if you have previously giving consent for us to do so and will continue to do so for as long as we believe the content is valid and of interest to you. You can of course unsubscribe anytime you like by following the link contained in the bottom of the email.
