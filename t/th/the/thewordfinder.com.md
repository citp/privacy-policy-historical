These companies may use aggregated information (NOT including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org

**The Way We Use Information:** We temporarily and anonymously collect users' IP address and click patterns for a period of time. This data may be shared with outside parties for consulting and monitoring purposes only. Data is not sold to outside parties. Email addresses that we receive questions or comments from are kept for the purpose of providing a response and updates. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
