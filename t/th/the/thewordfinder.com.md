**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices. 

  
**The Information We Collect:**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on thewordfinder.com. 

  
**The Way We Use Information:**

  
We temporarily and anonymously collect users' IP address and click patterns for a period of time. This data may be shared with outside parties for consulting and monitoring purposes only. No data is ever sold to outside parties. No information in the form of names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card #s etc is collected. 

  
Email addresses that we receive questions or comments from are kept for the purpose of providing a response and updates. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

  
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

  
**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the very limited information we collect online.
