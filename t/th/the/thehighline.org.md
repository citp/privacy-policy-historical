The website collects some information from you that is voluntarily provided by you, and other information that is collected by the website automatically. Additionally, we may collect Personal Information about you from other third-parties and combine it with our records, for example, to update your contact information.

When you visit the FHL website, certain information about your visit is automatically logged, which may include information about the type of browser you use, the server name and IP address through which you access the Internet, the date and time you access the site, the pages you access while at the FHL website, Internet service provider information, device type, and the Internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to, or depart from, the website.

We may collect information about your location when you access or use the website. We may also collect information regarding your general location using your IP address. If you access or use the website from a mobile device, we may collect more precise geolocation information from your mobile device. You can disable geolocation services in the settings on your mobile device.

FHL may also disclose Personal Information about you in connection with legal requirements, such as in response to a subpoena, governmental request, or investigation, or as otherwise required by law. In certain instances, we may agree to allow a vendor to use aggregated data about activity for general improvement or benchmarking purposes, generally in an anonymized or aggregate form.

We also may share your Personal Information with third-parties for any legitimate business purpose, or if we believe that the law requires us to do so, or to protect our property or the property of our partner and/or affiliates. Additionally, in the event of a corporate restructuring (such as a sale, merger, or other transfer of some or all of our asset), we may share your Personal Information with a third party. We reserve the right to use or disclose any information in aggregate form, for any purpose, in our sole judgment.
