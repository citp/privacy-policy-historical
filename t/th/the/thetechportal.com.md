# Welcome to The Tech Portal Privacy Policy | The Tech Portal

_In August 2014, we announced that The The Tech Portal was becoming a part of Blue Box Media Private Limited. Blue Box Media is a consolidated media company formed by combining The Tech Portal and Connect Jaipur (now functioning as a separate spin-off entity named WhereIndiaConnects). We server with the single mission of creating a global, digital-only media brand out of India, which could match up South Asia’s grim digital media scenario, to the west._
