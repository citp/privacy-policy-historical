<b>3. Who is collecting information?</b><br>

</p><p align="justify">
Please be advised that They Deserve It™ advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. Such information practices of those Web sites linked to They Deserve It™ are expressly not covered by this privacy statement. 

</p><p align="justify">
<b>4. With who else They Deserve It™ will share my information?</b> <br>
As a thumb rule, They Deserve It™ will not wilfully disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under extraneous circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below. Described herein under are some of the ways that your information may be shared or disclosed. 
</p><p align="justify">
Sponsors &amp; Business Partners: : They Deserve It™ may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically and expressly described to you at the time of data collection or prior to transferring the data. Some or all data collected during a They Deserve It™ promotion may be shared with a sponsor. If a part of personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. </p><p align="justify">

During many promotions offers you may be requested for additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give They Deserve It™ permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfil your request. In majority of instances, only your email address will be shared. 
</p><p align="justify">
Third Party Data &amp; Data Comparisons: Under confidentiality agreements, They Deserve It™ may match user information with third party data. Also, They Deserve It™ discloses patterned user statistics in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and or other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 
</p><p align="justify">

Ltd's rights or property, other They Deserve It™ users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. They Deserve It™ may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law or law-enforcing agency requires it. 
</p><p align="justify">

<b>5. Do I have choices or controls regarding collection, use, and distribution of my identifiable information?</b><br>
Upon your express interest about receiving offers or information from They Deserve It™ and our partners under confidentiality, may occasionally send you e-mail or postal mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you and only if you indicated that you welcome these offers. Any time you can easily unsubscribe from Compare Infobase Pvt. Ltd's mailing list and no longer receive such offers and mailings. 
</p><p align="justify">
On some types of They Deserve It™ promotions, we will ask for your email address in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. Your participation in these types of promotions, may automatically enlist you to receive promotion-related email. Sometime these promotion-related emails may include targeted advertisements. 
</p><p align="justify">

</p><p align="justify">
They Deserve It™ as a policy does not sell or rent your information to anyone. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer. You can choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain promotions or contests, if you do not wish to allow such data sharing. 

</p><p align="justify">
<b>6. How much protected is my personal financial information?</b><br>
To keep your personal financial information private is vital and important to us. As with all personal information, They Deserve It™ will never rent or sell your personal financial information. Your use of certain services or features, known to us, may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements. Yet as with all personally identifiable information, we do not make this available to any third parties without your permission. </p><p align="justify">

Please note that there may be places on the They Deserve It™ network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use best industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption technology. This sophisticated encryption process ensures that prying eyes are unable to decode your personal data when it travels from your computer to ours. 

</p><p align="justify">
<b>7. What security precautions are there to place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information? </b><br>
It may not be a norm but the fact remains that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure always. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, They Deserve It™ cannot ensure or warrant the total security of any information you transmit to us or for our online products purchase or services, and you do so at your own risk. But once we receive your transmission, we strive and make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 
</p><p align="justify">

<b>8. What else should I know about my privacy?</b><br>
Do keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, on mailing lists or in chat areas - that information can be seen and collected and used by others. In nutshell, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the other public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 
</p><p align="justify">
Finally, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any registration information. Please be careful and responsible on your own whenever you're online. 
</p><p align="justify">

<b>9. Is there any children's privacy?</b><br>
Yes, the safety of children is very important to us. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to Compare Infobase Pvt. Ltd, or to anyone online for that matter. They Deserve It™ does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties under any circumstances unless there is a special situation and such information is requested by law enforcing agency and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of their age. In addition, They Deserve It™ will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 14 without first obtaining their parents' permission.
