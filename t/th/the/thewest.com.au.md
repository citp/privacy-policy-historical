Privacy Policy

**National Privacy Principles**

West Australian Newspapers Holdings Limited and its controlled entities (the Group) are bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act. 

**Exemptions**

As the Group is a media organisation and is publicly committed to observing the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards, its acts and practices in the course of journalism are exempt from the provisions of the Act. The Australian Press Council Privacy Standards, and a listing of the Group publications which subscribe to them, is attached.

**Personal Information Held**

The Group only holds personal information which is necessary for the conduct of its business. The personal information that it does hold is treated in conformity with the National Privacy Principles.

**Your IP address**

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and set of numbers that serve as that computer’s “Internet Protocol” or IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any website hosted by the Group, the web server will automatically log the visitor’s IP address. The IP address reveals nothing personal about the visitor other than the IP address from which the visitor has accessed the website. The Group uses this information to examine website tracking statistics in an aggregated manner, not on an individual level.

**Cookies**

From time to time, this website or its advertisers may send a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored in your computer. It assigns a unique identification number to your computer and helps the Group to maintain your preferences between visits and to provide specialized services to you. Cookies do not damage your system.

**Advertisements**

The Group uses a third party advertising company to serve advertisements when you visit this website. The advertising company may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to this website in order to provide advertisements about goods or services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, the advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by the advertising company, please [click here ](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy)

**Site Measurement**

The Group uses the Nielsen Netratings system to provide measurement services in relation to this website. For more information about this system please visit their website: [Click here](http://www.netratings.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs)

**Aggregated Information**

The IP addresses and cookies allow the Group to aggregate information which includes such things as: usage of features; hits on specific pages, content, advertisements or promotions; access by users to partner, advertiser and other sites; information on revenue collection, statistical distribution and other use of the website. Aggregated information does not identify individuals and never contains user-specific information (i.e. it is information about a group of users and does not identify individual users). The Group reserves the right to share this aggregated information with anyone.

Australian Press Council Privacy Standards

September 2001

**Background**

**Underlying Principles**

Principle 3 of the Press Council's Statement of Principles states, with respect to privacy:

Readers of publications are entitled to have news and comment presented to them honestly and fairly, and with respect for the privacy and sensibilities of individuals. However, the right to privacy should not prevent publication of matters of public record or obvious or significant public interest. 

The need to balance respect for privacy with standards that recognise freedom of speech and of the press is recognised by the Privacy Act 1988. The Privacy Act provides an exemption for acts done or practices engaged in by a media organisation in the course of journalism, if the media organisation is publicly committed to observing standards that deal with privacy in the context of the activities of a media organisation, and those standards have been published in writing either by the organisation or a body representing a class of media organisations.

These Standards deal with privacy in the context of the activities of media organisations. They elaborate on the Press Council's Statement of Principles, and are published by the Press Council for the purposes of the Privacy Act exemption.

**Application of these Standards.**

These Standards apply to 'personal information', which is information or an opinion (including forming part of a database) whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information.

These Standards also recognise, as does the Privacy Act, that the media have a duty to inform the public on matters of significant public interest. For the purposes of these Standards, 'public interest' is defined as involving a matter capable of affecting the people at large so they might be legitimately interested in, or concerned about, what is going on, or what may happen to them or to others.

The media organisations, and the relevant publications, which are committed to these Standards are listed in the Schedule.

**1\. Collection of personal information**

In gathering news, journalists should seek personal information only in the public interest.

In doing so, journalists should not unduly intrude on the privacy of individuals and should show respect for the dignity and sensitivity of people encountered in the course of gathering news.

In accordance with Principle 4 of the Council's Statement of Principles, news obtained by unfair or dishonest means should not be published unless there is an overriding public interest. Generally, journalists should identify themselves as such. However, journalists and photographers may at times need to operate surreptitiously to expose crime, significantly anti-social conduct, public deception or some other matter in the public interest. 

Public figures necessarily sacrifice their right to privacy, where public scrutiny is in the public interest. However, public figures do not forfeit their right to privacy altogether. Intrusion into their right to privacy must be related to their public duties or activities.

**2\. Use and disclosure of personal information**

Personal information gathered by journalists and photographers should only be used for the purpose for which it was intended. 

A person who supplies personal information should have a reasonable expectation that it will be used for the purpose for which it was collected.

Some personal information, such as addresses or other identifying details, may enable others to intrude on the privacy and safety of individuals who are the subject of news coverage, and their families. To the extent lawful and practicable, a media organisation should only disclose sufficient personal information to identify the persons being reported in the news, so that these risks can be reasonably avoided.

**3\. Quality of personal information**

A media organisation should take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information it collects is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

**4\. Security of personal information**

A media organisation should take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information it holds is protected from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access.

**5\. Anonymity of sources**

All persons who provide information to media organisations are entitled to seek anonymity. The identity of confidential sources should not be revealed, and where it is lawful and practicable, a media organisation should ensure that any personal information which it maintains derived from such sources does not identify the source. 

**6\. Correction, fairness and balance**

In accordance with Principle 8 of the Council's Statement of Principles, where individuals are singled out for criticism, the publication should ensure fairness and balance in the original article. Failing that, the media organisation should provide a reasonable and swift opportunity for a balancing response in the appropriate section of the publication.

A media organisation should make amends for publishing any personal information that is found to be harmfully inaccurate, in accordance with Principle 2 of the Council's Statement of Principles. The media organisation should also take steps to correct any of its records containing that personal information, so as to avoid a harmful inaccuracy being repeated.

**7\. Sensitive personal information**

In accordance with Principle 7 of the Council's Statement of Principles, media organisations should not place any gratuitous emphasis on the categories of sensitive personal information listed in Principle 7, except where it is relevant and in the public interest to report and express opinions in these areas.

Members of the public caught up in newsworthy events should not be exploited. A victim or bereaved person has the right to refuse or terminate an interview or photographic session at any time.

Unless otherwise restricted by law or court order, open court hearings are matters of public record and can be reported by the press. Such reports need to be fair and balanced. They should not identify relatives or friends of people accused or convicted of crime unless the reference to them is necessary for the full, fair and accurate reporting of the crime or subsequent legal proceedings.

**8\. Complaints**

The Council will receive and deal with complaints from person or persons affected about possible breaches of these Standards in the same way as it receives and deals with complaints about possible breaches of its Statement of Principles. Where the Council issues an adjudication in relation to these Standards, the publication concerned must prominently print the adjudication.

These procedures apply to those media organisations listed in the Schedule.
