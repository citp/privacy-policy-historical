Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregate, and will not intentionally contain any Personal Information.

We may work with third-party service providers who use the technologies described in this section to conduct website analytics to help us track and understand how visitors use our Web site.  One such provider is Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.
