<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">We know that you care
how your information is used, and we appreciate your trust that we will
use it carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy
policy. <strong>By visiting us, you are accepting the privacy policy described below.</strong> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">1.<span>&nbsp; </span>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</span></strong></p>
<ul type="disc">

<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Information You Provide. </strong><span>&nbsp;</span>We receive and store information you      enter.<span>&nbsp; </span>For
example, when you search for or buy a product or service, or when you
supply information such as your address, phone number or credit card.
You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might
not be able to take advantage of some of our features.<span>&nbsp; </span>We
use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to
your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our
website, and communicating with you.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, if
you choose, we may share your information with other companies who
provide goods or services that you are interested in.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please see the “opt-in/opt-out”      selection in Section 4 of this policy.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many      websites, we use "cookies".<span>&nbsp; </span>Cookies
are small programs that we transfer to your hard drive that allow us to
recognize you and to provide you with a customized shopping experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>If
you do not want us to use cookies, you can easily disable them by going
to the toolbar of your web browser, and clicking on the “help” button.<span>&nbsp; </span>Follow
the instructions that will prevent the browser from accepting cookies,
or set the browser to inform you when you receive a new cookie.<span>&nbsp; </span>In
addition, you may visit this and other websites anonymously through the
use of utilities provided by other private companies. </li>

<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Other Information: </strong>Every      computer has an IP (Internet Protocol) address.<span>&nbsp; </span>IP addresses of computers used to visit      this site are noted.<span>&nbsp; </span>In
addition, we automatically collect other information such as email
addresses, browser types, operating systems, and the URL addresses of
sites clicked to and from this site. </li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Information from Other      Sources</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We might receive      information about you from other sources and add it to our account      information.<span>&nbsp; </span>This
may include updated delivery and address information from our shippers
or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your
next purchase or communication more easily.<span>&nbsp; </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">2.<span>&nbsp; </span>How Do We Use Your Information?</span></strong></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Customized Shopping.<span>&nbsp; </span></strong>We use your information to better      serve you by providing a customized shopping experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>As noted above, you may “opt-out” of      this customization, or even visit and shop anonymously.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Agents.</strong> We employ other
companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, and
processing credit card payments. They have access to personal
information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for
other purposes.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Special Offers</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We may send you special offers from time      to time, unless you choose to “opt-out” of receiving such offers.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, we may also send you      special offers from other companies.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again, you may “opt-out”.<span>&nbsp; </span>If      we send you offers from other businesses, we do not share your personal      information with them.<span>&nbsp; </span>The offers      come directly through us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please      see the “opt-in/opt-out” selection at the end of this policy.<span>&nbsp; </span></li>

<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Business Transfers</strong>. As we
continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores or
assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of
the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that we
are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred
assets. </li>
<li class="MsoNormal"><strong>Law Enforcement.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong>If we receive a lawful court order      to release account or other personal information then we will comply with      the law.<span>&nbsp; </span>We
will also release information when necessary to protect the life,
safety or property of others. This includes exchanging information with
other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
reduction. </li>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">3.<span>&nbsp; </span>How Do We Protect the Security of Your Information?</span></strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> </span></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">We work to protect the security of your
information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
software, which encrypts information you input. </li>
<li class="MsoNormal">We use encryption to protect      your information contained in our customer list.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">We use a firewall to protect      against unlawful intrusion.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">We limit access to your      information on a “need to know” basis.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">We reveal only the last five digits of your
credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit
the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company
during order processing. </li>
<li class="MsoNormal">It is important for you to protect against
unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to
sign off when finished using a shared computer. </li>
<li class="MsoNormal">No system can guarantee      absolute security, just as the finest lock can not guarantee physical      security.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, we take every      reasonable precaution to assure that your data is secure.</li>
