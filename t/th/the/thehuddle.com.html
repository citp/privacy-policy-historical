                            <b>Location Information.</b>&nbsp;  We may collect location information (e.g., city and state and/or zip  code) that you provide.&nbsp; Certain devices  and browsers contain unique identifiers that can be used to identify the  geographical location of the device.&nbsp;  When you use such a device or browser to access our Site, your device  and/or browser may automatically collect and/or transmit your location  information.&nbsp; We also may collect GPS  information from the device if the device transmits it. Additionally, if you  download our app, we may collect your location information in order to deliver  our app services.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you choose to  enable certain features in our apps that require your geographic location, then  we will collect and store that information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <b>Other Information Automatically Collected to Improve the Site and  Deliver Targeted Advertising.&nbsp; </b>We also  collect and store information through a variety of automatic technologies, such  as browser and flash cookies, pixels and web beacons about your use of our  Site, including device identifying information such as IP addresses, MAC  address or other device-specific alphanumerical ID numbers, the make and model  of your device, the wireless provider associated with your device, whether you  downloaded the app, the source of the download of the App (for example, whether  via a particular advertisement for the App), when the App is launched, how many  times a particular page within the Site is visited, which features the users  interact with, and your device or computer's connection to the Internet.&nbsp; If you choose to connect to our Site through  a social network such as Facebook, we may automatically collect your profile  information.&nbsp; These things allow us,  among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to  measure traffic on the Site.&nbsp; <br>

By showing how and when visitors use  the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique  users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from  having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may  have entered preference information before.

                            How Information is Used <br>
                            We use the information we collect  from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including, for  example, for the purpose for which the information was submitted, to process  your registration request, to provide you with services and communications that  you have requested, to send you email updates and other communications,  customize features and advertising that appear on the Site, to deliver our Site  content to you, to measure Site traffic, measure user interests and traffic  patterns, and to improve the Site and the services and features offered via the  Site.&nbsp; <br>

                            We may combine information we  collect from you while you are using our Site with information that we collect  from other sources to customize features, content and advertising that appear  on our Site.&nbsp; <br>

  <b>Your Choices.&nbsp; </b>When we request  information from you on the Site, you may always choose not to provide us with  that information.&nbsp; But if you decline to  supply or provide us with certain information while using the Site, you may not  be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through  the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            If you want to limit the  information that is automatically collected while you use our Site, most Web  browsers allow you to disable certain functionality or set certain privacy  setting.

For example, if you use a credit or debit card to complete  a transaction on our Site, we may share your personal information and credit  card number with a credit card processing and/or a fulfillment company in order  to complete your transaction, or such service provider(s) may collect that  information from you directly, on our behalf.&nbsp; <br>
                            If you do not wish certain  information to be shared for these purposes, send a letter to the&nbsp;<a href="#OnlinePrivacyCoodinator">Online Privacy Coordinator</a>&nbsp;whose contact information is listed at  the end of this Privacy Notice.<br>

We may share with our provider partner any information you provide,  or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made  available in cooperation with our provider partner.

The Privacy Notice of our provider partners may differ from ours.  If you have any questions regarding the Privacy Notice of one of our provider  partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more  information.<br>
  <b>Sharing Information with Third Parties for  Advertising and Other Promotional Purposes.</b>&nbsp; We may use third-party service providers to  target and serve some of the advertisements you see on the Site.&nbsp; We may share technical or aggregate  information, such as type of pages viewed and categories of interest, from our  Site with these service providers and advertisers for their use in displaying  ads on our Site.&nbsp; These third party  providers and advertisers may use their own browser or flash cookies, web  beacons and similar technologies to collect technical information (such as  device unique identifier, IP address, MAC address, browser type, pages visited,  and location information) from users of the Site that is generated  automatically as a user views or interacts with an ad.&nbsp; These service providers may use that  information, sometimes in conjunction with similar information gathered through  other websites and other sources, to deliver advertisements on this Site, and  on other websites. <br>
                            Unless you affirmatively provide  information within an ad, the data collected in connection with the ads, ad  serving and ad targeting on our Site does not include your name, address, email  address or telephone number, but it may include the device unique  identifier,&nbsp; IP address, MAC address and  location information of your computer or device.&nbsp; The use and collection of information by  third-party advertising service providers is governed by the relevant third  party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Notice<br>
