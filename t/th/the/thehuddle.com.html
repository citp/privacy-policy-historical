                    Each time a visitor comes to The Huddle, our servers -- like 
                    most on the Web -- collect some basic technical information. 
                    Examples of this basic information include the visitor's domain 
                    name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or 
                    earthlink.net), referral data (e.g., we record the address 
                    of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to 
                    a Huddle web site) and browser and platform type (e.g., a 
                    Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                    also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into

                    we may merge information about visitors and visits into group 
                    data, which may then be used for internal research and analysis. 
                    We will not disclose your individual identity or personally 
                    identifiable data without your permission. When we do present
