Your identity cannot be reasonably ascertained from this information.

If you communicate directly with us via e-mail, complete one of our online forms, or use one of our other interactive tools, some of the information that you submit may be personal information (that is, information from which you can be identified, such as your full name, street address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on).

If you choose to provide your personal information to us, it may be used in order to:

  * contact you in respect of a query you made;
  * provide the services that you require and ensure our site is relevant to your needs;
  * deliver services such as email bulletins (if you have requested them);
  * answer your requests and queries;
  * research and develop our products and services;
  * gain an understanding of your needs in order to provide a better service;
  * promote and market our services;
  * protect our intellectual property and ownership rights, or
  * fulfil any legal requirements.



We may disclose your personal information to other organisations (for example our service providers) to enable us to provide the services you have requested, or as otherwise permitted by law.

## **Contacting us via email and our web forms**

When you contact The Web Showroom via email:

  * we will not disclose your email address without first obtaining your consent.

In particular, email sent to or from this website and information you enter into forms on our web-pages and send to us may not be secure. You should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email and web-forms.



## Search Engine Optimisation Privacy

We exercise a strict privacy policy for all clients whom elect to start a campaign centered on [search engine optimisation](http://www.thewebshowroom.com.au/seo/). Small businesses as well as enterprise companies often request that we sign an NDA to ensure The Web Showroom does not disclose to any 3rd parties that it is providing search engine optimisation services for the company’s website. This is not uncommon due to the competitive nature of the industries that our clients compete amongst. Please let a representative know if an NDA is required for any SEO services provided by The Web Showroom.
