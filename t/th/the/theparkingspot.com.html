<p align="justify">As part of the operation of this website (the “Website”), PRG
Parking Management, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company d/b/a The
Parking Spot gathers certain types of information about users of this
Website.&nbsp; This policy describes the
types of information gathered, what is done with it, and how to correct or
change the information.</p>

<p align="justify">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>The Information Collected</u>.</b>&nbsp; The Parking Spot collects two types of
personally identifying information from users who use this Website:&nbsp; personal information (such as names and
e-mail addresses) and aggregated information (such as information about how
many users log into this Website on a daily basis, and other information about
traffic patterns on this Website).</p>

<p align="justify">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal
information is collected when users voluntarily provide personal information to
The Parking Spot, such as when they make parking reservations, join The Spot
Club or manage their Spot Club account, request answers to specific questions,
respond to surveys, or register for contests and other promotional
opportunities which may be provided by The Parking Spot from time to time.</p>

<p align="justify">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Parking Spot may use various methods to collect aggregated user information,
such as information as to which pages users access or visit, and aggregations of
information volunteered by users such as survey information and/or site
registrations.&nbsp; For example, when you
click on this Website, our servers log your IP address, which is a number
automatically assigned to your computer or a group of computers by your
Internet service provider.</p>

<p align="justify">The Parking Spot uses “cookies” to collect certain
information while respecting your privacy.&nbsp;
A “cookie” is a small data file that many websites write to your hard
drive for recordkeeping purposes when you visit the websites.&nbsp; Cookies allow The Parking Spot to measure
activity on the Website and to improve your enjoyment of the Website by, for
example, remembering your viewing preferences and, if you registered for The
Spot Club, your password.&nbsp; The Parking
Spot does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was
not originally written to your hard drive by The Parking Spot.&nbsp; The Parking Spot does not use any
information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing
purposes or share such information with any third parties, other than
information that you voluntarily provided to The Parking Spot as described
above.&nbsp; You may occasionally get cookies
from third parties who may advertise on the Website, which is customary in the
Internet industry.&nbsp; Since The Parking
Spot does not control these cookies, these cookies are not subject to The
Parking Spot’s privacy policies.&nbsp; Most
web browsers are initially set to accept cookies; if you prefer, you can set
your web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being
sent.&nbsp; However, it is possible that some
parts of this Website will not function properly if your web browser is set to
refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="justify">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Use of Information Collected by The
Parking Spot</u>.</b>&nbsp; The Parking Spot
uses both the personal and aggregated information that it collects for various
purposes.&nbsp; The information is used to
improve the content of this Website, to customize the content and/or layout of
this Website for each user, and to notify users about updates to this Website
or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe would be of
interest.&nbsp; Each time that The Parking
Spot uses this information to send you a notice, you will be given the
opportunity to elect not to receive any further notices from The Parking Spot,
simply by following the simple procedure described in the notice.&nbsp; The Parking Spot may use IP addresses for
the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregated data to
advertisers about the volume of use on this Website.&nbsp; The Parking Spot may share aggregated information with some third
parties for both advertising and promotional purposes.&nbsp; The Parking Spot may share personal
information with third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.&nbsp; The Parking Spot may disclose personal
information, when it believes in good faith that such disclosure is legally
required, to protect its rights or the safety of others.&nbsp; If you object to The Parking Spot’s use of
any personal information which you may provide for any reason, you may stop
such use by modifying your registration information.&nbsp; To change or delete your registration information, provide
specific information in an e-mail sent to The Parking Spot via this Website’s
“Contact Us” feature.</p>

<p align="justify">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Children and Privacy</u>.</b>&nbsp; The Parking Spot encourages parents and
guardians to spend time with their children on-line, so as to be fully familiar
with the websites visited by their children.&nbsp;
At various places on this Website, for example in requesting personal
information, The Parking Spot may ask whether the user is under a specified
age, and if so The Parking Spot may ask for parental consent.&nbsp; In each such case, The Parking Spot relies
on users to be truthful in responding to these questions and providing such
consent.&nbsp; In no event should any
information be submitted to or posted on this Website by users under the age of
16.&nbsp; Users under the age of 18 are
requested not to participate in contests or other promotional
opportunities.&nbsp; Users who are 16 or 17
years old are requested not to submit or post information to this Website
without the consent of their parent or guardian.&nbsp; The Parking Spot may collect information, including personally
identifying information, from users who are 16 or 17 years old and who submit
or post information to this Website with the consent of their parent or
guardian.&nbsp;&nbsp; This information may be used
for marketing and promotional purposes and may be shared with third parties.&nbsp; If a user or his or her parent or guardian
changes his or her mind with respect to such use, such user, parent or guardian
may stop such use, either by an e-mail sent to The Parking Spot via the
Website’s “Contact Us” feature or by modifying his or her registration
information on-line.&nbsp; Finally, it is
important to note that this Website contains links to other websites, and that
those websites may not follow the same privacy policies as The Parking
Spot.&nbsp; These websites may send their own
cookies to your hard drive, and may collect information and make use of such
information in ways that The Parking Spot would not.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="justify">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Miscellaneous Provisions</u>.</b>&nbsp; The Parking Spot reserves the right to
change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving
effect to any principles of conflicts of law.&nbsp;
If any provision hereof shall be unlawful, void or for any reason
unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Privacy
Policy, and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
provisions hereof.&nbsp; The rights granted
to you hereunder are personal to you and are not subject to transfer or
assignment.&nbsp; Any claim relating to this
Website or its use shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts located in Illinois, and by your use of this Website
you submit yourself to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
