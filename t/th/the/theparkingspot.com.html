        As part of the operation of this website (the "Website"), PRG Parking Management,
        L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company d/b/a The Parking Spot gathers certain
        types of information about users of this Website. This policy describes the types
        of information gathered, what is done with it, and how to correct or change the
        information.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        1. <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Information Collected</span>.</b>
        The Parking Spot collects two types of personally identifying information from users
        who use this Website: personal information (such as names and e-mail addresses)
        and aggregated information (such as information about how many users log into this
        Website on a daily basis, and other information about traffic patterns on this Website).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        (a) Personal information is collected when users voluntarily provide personal information
        to The Parking Spot, such as when they make parking reservations, join The Spot
        Club or manage their Spot Club account, request answers to specific questions, respond
        to surveys, or register for contests and other promotional opportunities which may
        be provided by The Parking Spot from time to time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        (b) The Parking Spot may use various methods to collect aggregated user information,
        such as information as to which pages users access or visit, and aggregations of
        information volunteered by users such as survey information and/or site registrations.
        For example, when you click on this Website, our servers log your IP address, which
        is a number automatically assigned to your computer or a group of computers by your
        Internet service provider.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The Parking Spot uses "cookies" to collect certain information while respecting
        your privacy. A "cookie" is a small data file that many websites write to your hard
        drive for recordkeeping purposes when you visit the websites. Cookies allow The
        Parking Spot to measure activity on the Website and to improve your enjoyment of
        the Website by, for example, remembering your viewing preferences and, if you registered
        for The Spot Club, your password. The Parking Spot does not use cookies to retrieve
        information from your computer that was not originally written to your hard drive
        by The Parking Spot. The Parking Spot does not use any information transferred through
        cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes or share such information with
        any third parties, other than information that you voluntarily provided to The Parking
        Spot as described above. You may occasionally get cookies from third parties who
        may advertise on the Website, which is customary in the Internet industry. Since
        The Parking Spot does not control these cookies, these cookies are not subject to
        The Parking Spot's privacy policies. Most web browsers are initially set to accept
        cookies; if you prefer, you can set your web browser to refuse cookies or to alert
        you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of this
        Website will not function properly if your web browser is set to refuse cookies
        or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        2. <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Information Collected by The
            Parking Spot</span>.</b> The Parking Spot uses both the personal and aggregated
        information that it collects for various purposes. The information is used to improve
        the content of this Website, to customize the content and/or layout of this Website
        for each user, and to notify users about updates to this Website or promotional
        offers or opportunities that we believe would be of interest. Each time that The
        Parking Spot uses this information to send you a notice, you will be given the opportunity
        to elect not to receive any further notices from The Parking Spot, simply by following
        the simple procedure described in the notice. The Parking Spot may use IP addresses
        for the purposes of system administration and to provide aggregated data to advertisers
        about the volume of use on this Website. The Parking Spot may share aggregated information
        with some third parties for both advertising and promotional purposes. The Parking
        Spot may share personal information with third parties for marketing or promotional
        purposes. The Parking Spot may disclose personal information, when it believes in
        good faith that such disclosure is legally required, to protect its rights or the
        safety of others. If you object to The Parking Spot's use of any personal information
        which you may provide for any reason, you may stop such use by modifying your registration
        information. To change or delete your registration information, provide specific
        information in an e-mail sent to The Parking Spot via this Website's "Contact Us"
        feature.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        3. <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children and Privacy</span>.</b>
        The Parking Spot encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children
        on-line, so as to be fully familiar with the websites visited by their children.
        At various places on this Website, for example in requesting personal information,
        The Parking Spot may ask whether the user is under a specified age, and if so The
        Parking Spot may ask for parental consent. In each such case, The Parking Spot relies
        on users to be truthful in responding to these questions and providing such consent.
        In no event should any information be submitted to or posted on this Website by
        users under the age of 16. Users under the age of 18 are requested not to participate
        in contests or other promotional opportunities. Users who are 16 or 17 years old
        are requested not to submit or post information to this Website without the consent
        of their parent or guardian. The Parking Spot may collect information, including
        personally identifying information, from users who are 16 or 17 years old and who
        submit or post information to this Website with the consent of their parent or guardian.
        This information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes and may be shared
        with third parties. If a user or his or her parent or guardian changes his or her
        mind with respect to such use, such user, parent or guardian may stop such use,
        either by an e-mail sent to The Parking Spot via the Website's "Contact Us" feature
        or by modifying his or her registration information on-line. Finally, it is important
        to note that this Website contains links to other websites, and that those websites
        may not follow the same privacy policies as The Parking Spot. These websites may
        send their own cookies to your hard drive, and may collect information and make
        use of such information in ways that The Parking Spot would not.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        4. <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Miscellaneous Provisions</span>.</b>
        The Parking Spot reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without
        notice. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
        the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts
        of law. If any provision hereof shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable,
        then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Privacy Policy, and shall
        not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions hereof. The
        rights granted to you hereunder are personal to you and are not subject to transfer
        or assignment. Any claim relating to this Website or its use shall be subject to
        the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Illinois,
        and by your use of this Website you submit yourself to the personal jurisdiction
        of such courts.</p>
