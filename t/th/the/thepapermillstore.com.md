# We Guarantee Your Privacy and Value Your Trust

We do not sell, rent, loan or share your email addresses. When you request that we send you our money saving newsletter you have the option to easily unsubscribe at any time.

**We protect your privacy.**  
We employ state-of-the-art encryption to protect your private information. We also contract with Hacker Safe to ensure that we are providing you with a secure Web site. **This site is tested and** **certified** **daily** to pass the **FBI/SANS Internet Security Test**. **Our site meets all of the highest security scanning standards of the U.S. government, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and JCB.** We shred all customer documents so that your personal information is not discarded in an unsafe manner when we recycle our paper trash.  
  
**We respect your privacy.**  
Any information you provide to us will be used for internal purposes and the processing of your orders and requests. We collect basic login data \- email address, password, company name, shipping address, order details, etc. - when you register with us. This information is used to identify our customers when you return to The Paper Mill Store .com, to send you order confirmations, to process your orders and to contact you regarding your order should there be a need. When you register, if you opt in for email notifications and our newsletter, we will periodically send out announcements and special offers. We do our best to make these emails meaningful to you.

**We guarantee your privacy.**  
We know that you don't want your name and personal details transferred to third parties. We will not sell, trade or rent your information to a third party. We will only provide your information to a third party \- the likes of UPS or FedEx as primary examples - when it is necessary for processing your order and facilitating your delivery. We will forward your email address to our special offer partners, when you ask that we do so through your request for free subscriptions and free memberships from these very well respected publications; Graphic Design USA and Paper Specs. If we perceive a need to inform any other party of your details, we will ask for your specific permission on a case by case basis. For example, if you wanted us to expedite an order and shipping from another party would hasten delivery, we would ask you if this was OK before moving forward.  
**We value your trust.**  
Any information you give us will be held with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways that you have not consented to. We may, from time to time, contact you with updated product information and special deals or to inquire as to the quality of our service to you.  
**  
We would be pleased to hear from you.**  
If you have any questions or comments or if you would like us to confirm that we have not shared your information, please feel free to contact us at **(800) 790-TPMS (8767)** or [cs@thepapermillstore.com](mailto:cs@thepapermillstore.com)
