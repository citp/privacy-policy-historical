<br>
<p>TheBigLot.com is a classified service provided by
Adventis, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Adventis, Inc. established TheBiglot.com as a means for customers to achieve
unprecedented online exposure for their vehicle, while at the same time having
access to unparalleled customer service. TheBigLot.com recognizes and
understands your concerns about privacy and the use of your personal
information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This Privacy Policy is
intended to summarize the privacy practices of the <a href="http://www.thebiglot.com/">www.thebiglot.com</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<font size="4"><b>Personal Information from Visitors</b></font>

<p>In order to facilitate the sale of vehicles and related services online,
 it is imperative that personal information is collected.  Personal information
  on TheBiglot.com falls into two distinct categories: 1) personal information
   that visitors volunteer and 2) tracking information that does not identify you
    as an individual but that assists us in tracking affiliate referrals.</p>



<p>When filling out an ad or form on TheBigLot.com, visitors must volunteer personal information.  "Personal information" may include name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and specific vehicle information.  Personal information is used for three main purposes: 1) as contact information for anyone interested in purchasing a vehicle; 2) to help us provide fulfillment services in connection with goods and services ordered by you; and 3) to offer more information about our service.  Thus, as a customer of TheBigLot.com, you will be contacted by potential buyers.  We may contact you about your account or send you information directly related to the purpose for which you have registered.  As a visitor to TheBigLot.com, the contact information you volunteer may be used by TheBigLot.com or its affiliates to offer you more information about our services.  In particular, please understand that when seeking a quote on a new vehicle your contact information will be forwarded to both an affiliate and dealerships to fulfill your request for information.  </p>



<p>As a customer, you must understand your information is available to everyone when posting an ad on the Internet.  We cannot control how potential buyers or businesses use your contact information.  If a business calls you about your vehicle and you're not interested in their service, tell them: "Put me on your Do Not Call list" and hang up.  If a business e-mails you and you're not interested, DO NOT RESPOND to the e-mail.  Do not even respond to request the removal of your name from their mailing list.  Many companies send out e-mails just to verify that you have a legitimate e-mail address.  You also need to remember that your personal information will continue to be available on the Internet until you notify us to cancel your ad.  You may discontinue your ad by calling us at 1 (800) 430-1965 (<i>Please note that refund requests must be submitted in writing</i>) or writing to:  </p>


<ul>
 Adventis Inc.<br>
 Attn: Customer Care<br>
 P.O. Box 1671<br>
 Roanoke, VA<br>
 24008<br>
</ul>



<p>If you wish to obtain a hard copy of the personal information contained in your ad, contact our Customer Care department at 1 (800) 430-1965, ext. 2 and request that we fax you a copy of the information.  </p>



<font size="4"><b>Amending Personal Information</b></font>



<p>As a customer, you may also make corrections or updates to
the personal information that you provide us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With respect to your personal contact information, (i.e., your name,
address, telephone number and e-mail address) you must contact our Customer
Care department at 1 (800) 430-1965, ext. 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With respect to specific vehicle information, you may either contact
Customer Care or make changes online.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When making changes online, simply click "Find Your Ad" on the
TheBigLot.com home page, enter your Customer ID number, click "GO", and then
enter the Pin Number given to you when you purchased the ad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please be aware that this information is
located on a non-secure site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>



<font size="4"><b>Use of Cookies</b></font>



<p>In order for TheBigLot.com to better track affiliate
referrals, and thus better target our services to you, we place a small text
file on your hard drive, called a "cookie".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Cookies do not contain any personal data, they do not damage your files,
and they do not allow us or anyone else to access your personally identifiable
information - they simply tell us what site referred you to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cookies may contain such information as an
IP address, DNS host name, and/or browser type.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">&nbsp; </span>We may aggregate this information in order to analyze website
traffic figures and technical issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We may also share aggregate (not individual) site referral statistics
with advertisers and other third parties, but again, this information will not
include any personally identifiable information.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">&nbsp; </span>If you do not wish to receive cookies on your hard drive, most
web browsers have a help option that will explain how to reject certain cookies
or to disable them entirely.</p>



<font size="4"><b>Policy on Children's Personal Information</b></font>



<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from
children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To ensure that children's
privacy is respected on our Web site, we will not knowingly allow anyone under
the age of 13 to provide any personally identifying information. In the event
that someone under the age of 13 indicates that they have provided personally
identifiable information to us, we will immediately remove that information
from the website.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such information will
not be sold to any third party for any purpose whatsoever.</p>



<font size="4"><b>Contact Information for Affiliates</b></font>



<p>TheBigLot.com also runs an affiliate referral program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Technical contact information is required
for such partnerships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Technical
contact information" includes name, name of employer, business address, and
e-mail address.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Technical contact
information is only used to carry out the purpose of each partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This information is not sold to third
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The technical contact
information is collected on a non-secure registration page.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>



<font size="4"><b>Links on TheBigLot.com</b></font>



<p>In order to better serve you, and make your visit to our
site more worthwhile, TheBigLot.com has links on the homepage to other third
party Web service providers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those
third party Web service providers specialize in pricing new and used cars and
obtaining vehicle history reports and insurance quotes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When you choose to visit those sites, we are
not responsible for their privacy policies or how they treat user information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You should review the privacy policies of
these third parties when supplying personally identifiable information, as they
will likely differ from this one.</p>



<p>TheBigLot.com strives to protect your information off-line
as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We restrict access to personal
financial information to those employees who need to process your account
and/or refunds, such as a customer service representative or the Chief
Financial Officer.</p>



<p>Finally, under certain circumstances, TheBigLot.com may
disclose personal information when required by law. </p>



<font size="4"><b>Personal Information / Data Security</b></font>



<p>The security of the information you provide to TheBigLot.com
is important to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Information that is
collected by TheBigLot.com and TheBigLot.com website is stored on in-house
controlled databases and servers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
includes any information provided by visitors, even those who do not order our
service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We have implemented security
policies, rules, and technical measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and
alteration of sensitive information under our control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, all credit card transactions
are protected by the latest Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption
technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SSL is the Internet
standard for secured transactions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
you have any questions about the use of your credit card information, please
