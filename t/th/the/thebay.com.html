  		<h4>Hbc is protecting your privacy</h4><br>
        <p>For over 335 years, Hudson's Bay Company (Hbc) has been a name that means trust in this country. We value you as our customer, and want to assure you that our 70,000 associates are committed to upholding the trust you've placed in us as Canada's oldest corporation and largest department store retailer.</p> 

		<p>Hbc's Principles for the Protection of Personal Information were created to ensure we preserve the confidentiality, accuracy and security of your personal information. These principles guide us in the collection, use, retention and disclosure of your personal information in all of our Hbc family of stores and services: the Bay, Zellers, Home Outfitters, Fields, Hbc Credit, Hbc Rewards and Hbc Insurance. </p>
        
        <h3>The information that we collect</h3>
        <p>Personal information means any information about an identifiable individual. This includes information such as your name, address, telephone number, birth date, purchase information or e-mail address. As a customer, you provide Hbc with this information in a variety of ways, such as when making a purchase, applying for an Hbc Credit Card, enrolling in our Hbc Rewards program, entering in-store contests or signing up for our Gift Registry program.  In every case, Hbc adheres to strict guidelines when dealing with your personal information.  </p>
        
        <h3>Collecting your personal information</h3>
        <p>Hbc collects and uses personal information in connection with providing you with goods and services. </p>

		<p>When you provide Hbc with personal information, we will inform you as to why we are collecting it. </p>

		<p>Hbc obtains your consent for the collection of your personal information. In some instances, where the purpose for collection is obvious, your consent is implied. </p>

		<p>Hbc will ask for your permission to collect additional information that may be useful in serving you in the future.</p>

            
        <h3>Using and disclosing your personal information</h3>
	    <p>Hbc only uses and discloses your personal information for the marketing purposes identified to you when your consent  to the collection of your personal information was obtained.</p>

		<p>Hbc does not provide your personal information for marketing purposes of other organizations without your consent.</p>

		<p>You can withdraw, at any time, your consent for the use of your personal information that is not required for a transaction subject to legal restrictions and upon reasonable notice to Hbc. Your information may be retained by Hbc for audit or archival purposes.</p>
        


        <h3>Maintaining and safeguarding your personal information</h3>
        <p>Hbc strives to ensure that our security measures protect against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use, disclosure or modification of your personal information.</p>

		<p>Hbc limits access to your personal information to those Hbc associates who may need it for use in accordance with Hbc's established privacy principles.</p>
 
		<p>Hbc associates sign an annual Code of Conduct, which requires them to keep your personal information confidential and comply with our security standards.</p>
 
		<p>Hbc keeps your information for as long as necessary to accomplish the identified purpose and in order to serve you better.  Your information is then destroyed according to legislative requirements.</p>
        


        <h3>You are entitled to access your personal information</h3>
        <p>If you request access to your personal information, Hbc will respond to your request within 30 days. </p>

		<p>There is no cost for reasonable requests unless you require copies of records. Hbc will advise you of the cost, if any, prior to copying those records.</p>
 
		<p>Hbc may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information where the information cannot be separated from the records of others, cannot be disclosed for reasons of security or commercial confidentiality, or is protected by legal privilege.</p>

        
        <h3>Hbc provides you with the answers</h3>
        <p>Hbc has established a Privacy Office and has appointed a senior executive as its Privacy Officer to ensure that everyone at Hbc complies with our Principles for the Protection of Personal Information. Hbc will investigate and respond to any questions, complaints or requests for information you may have. </p>

		<h4>Hbc Insurance Privacy Information</h4>
		<br>
		<p>Hbc avantem insurance agency Inc. is a subsidiary of Hbc.  It operates as "Hbc Insurance" and "Hbc Insurance Agency" ("we", "our", "us"). We promote and distribute a unique variety of insurance (and related) products, underwritten by some of Canada's leading insurance companies and other service providers. In doing this we need to collect, use, retain and sometimes disclose personal information. When we do collect, use, retain and disclose personal information, we are guided by the general privacy principles set out in <i>Hbc's Protection of Personal Information Principles</i> and the specific personal information practices set out below. </p>
		
		<h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>

		<p>The information provided by you to process requests for an insurance premium quote and/or to complete any applications for insurance, and other information which may be provided by you from time to time, is required by Hudson’s Bay Company to provide and administer requested products and services or to provide requested information.</p>

		<p>When an individual requests an insurance quote, inquires about insurance products (or related services), applies for coverage or becomes a policyholder, such individual is consenting to the collection, use, retention, and, if necessary, the disclosure of personal information. An individual is always free to decline or opt-out of this type of collection, use, retention and disclosure or personal information, but in that event, we will be unable to provide the requested services. </p>

		<h3>Optional Use and Disclosure of your Personal Information</h3>
		<p>When you request a quote, inquire about insurance or related products, apply for coverage or become a policy holder through us, you become a customer of Hbc Insurance Agency.

These communications may include notifications of insurance (and related) products like auto, property, life and health insurance or other products which may be of interest to you.  The information we disclose for such marketing purposes is limited to contact information and details of plan participation.  It would not include health or lifestyle information, which would only be given to an insurance company in connection with an application for insurance.  Your consent to use of your personal information for these additional marketing purposes is optional and is not required as a condition of obtaining an insurance premium quote, receiving information about insurance (and related) products, applying for insurance coverage or becoming a policyholder.</p>
