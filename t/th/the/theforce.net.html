      This site is owned and operated by TF.N, LLC. Your privacy on the Internet is of the       utmost
      importance to us. At Theforce.net, we want to make your experience
      online satisfying and safe.<p>

      Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we
      feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions
      surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy
      statement discloses what information we gather and how we use
      it.</p><p>

      INFORMATION Theforce.net.com GATHERS AND TRACKS</p><p>

      Theforce.net gathers two types of information about users:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Information that users provide through optional, voluntary
          submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our
          electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards
          or forums, to email a friend, registration for collection
          tracking and from participation in polls, surveys and entering
          our drawings:<p>
        </p></li>
        <li>
          Information Theforce.net
          gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly
          by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information
          allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and
          to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the
          demographics of our audience. Because Theforce.net and
          Collecting Headquarters, Inc. derives its revenue mainly from
          sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated
          demographic data is essential to keeping our service free or
          low cost to users.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Theforce.net Gathers User
      Information In The Following Processes:<p>

      Optional Voluntary Information</p><p>

      We offer the following free services, which require some type of
      voluntary submission of personal information by users:</p><p>

      Electronic newsletters</p><p>

      We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Theforce.net gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page.
</p><p>

      Message boards/forums</p><p>

      Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register
      separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order
      to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the
      site. During registration the user is required to supply a
      username, password, and email address.</p><p>

      Polling</p><p>

      We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share
      their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks
      about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are
      aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user.
      Theforce.net may use a system to
      "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only
      once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with
      information about individual users.</p><p>

      Surveys</p><p>

      Theforce.net may occasionally
      conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience.
      We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these
      surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never
      share any of this information about specific individuals with any
      third party.</p><p>

      Children</p><p>

      Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection
      Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally
      identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without
      requesting parental consent.</p><p>

      Usage tracking</p><p>

      Theforce.net tracks user traffic
      patterns throughout. However, we do not correlate
      this information with data about individual users. Rebelscum.com
      may break down overall usage
      statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and
      MIME type by reading this information from the browser string
      (information contained in every user's browser).</p><p>

      Theforce.net may track
      and catalog the search terms that users enter in our Search
      function, but this tracking is never associated with individual
      users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our
      sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.
      We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well
      each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a
      better service for you.</p><p>

      Cookies</p><p>

      We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the
      browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain
      Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use
      of this site to information that you have specifically and
      knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can
      contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read
      data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other
      sites. Theforce.net uses cookies
      to track user traffic patterns (as described above), to track
      use of our polling feature, and to save users time when registering
      for our giveaways. Additionally, our
      advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track ad
      impressions and click rates.</p><p>

      You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If
      you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you
      will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need
      to have cookies turned on to use this site. However, you do need
      cookies to participate actively in message boards, forums, polling
      and surveys.</p><p>

      USE OF INFORMATION</p><p>

      Theforce.net may use any
      information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their
      experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive
      or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future
      content based on the interests of our users.</p><p>

      As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide
      in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to
      participate in polls, surveys, message boards, forums and drawings.
      We may send
      out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on
      the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when
      we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something
      we are doing.

      When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our
      sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas.
      We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well
      each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a
      better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search
      function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But
      we don't track which terms a particular user enters.</p><p>

      Theforce.net creates aggregate
      reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers,
      sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise
      more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements
      that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the
      usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will
      never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not
      disclose any information about any individual user except to
      comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect
      the personal safety of our users or the public.</p><p>

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p><p>

      SHARING OF THE INFORMATION</p><p>

      Theforce.net uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your
      needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's
      demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. 
      We may also share user information
      to comply with applicable law or valid legal process
      or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p><p>

      SECURITY</p><p>

      Theforce.net operates a secure
      data network protected by industry standard firewall and password
      protection systems. Our security and privacy policies
      are reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only
      authorized individuals have access to the information provided by
      our visitors.</p><p>

      OPT-OUT POLICY</p><p>

      We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such
      choices include:</p><p>

      </p><ul>
        <li>
         Opting not to register to receive our electronic newsletters,
         if any.<p>
        </p></li><li>
         Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which
         completely alleviates the need to gather any personally
         identifiable information from our users.
      </li></ul>

      YOUR CONSENT<p>

      By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this
      information by Theforce.net. If
      we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes
      on this page so that you are always aware of what information we
      collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose
      it.</p><p>
