By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted.

We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
