Privacy Policy   
Pelmorex Media Inc. ("PMI") is committed to respecting and safeguarding the privacy of our stakeholders and to ensure the protection of personal information of our employees, customers, clients and users of this web site. It has always been fundamental to the way we do business at Pelmorex in all our relationships, either on or off the Internet: we are committed to keeping personal information accurate, confidential, secure and private.

PMI's policy is simple: we collect personal information about you only when you knowingly and willingly provide it, and we will not share or otherwise profit from the distribution of personal data beyond the use it was provided to fulfill.

Our practices conform with the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information (CAN/CSA - Q830-06) and the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Privacy Policy Guidelines. The code consists of ten inter-related principles which are outlined below.

The Ten Privacy Principles   
Principle 1 - Accountability   
Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes   
Principle 3 - Consent   
Principle 4 - Limiting Collection   
Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention   
Principle 6 - Accuracy   
Principle 7 - Safeguarding Customer Information   
Principle 8 - Openness   
Principle 9 - Customer Access   
Principle 10 - Handling Customer Complaints and Suggestions

Principle 1 - Accountability   
PMI is responsible for all personal information under its control including any personal information disclosed to third parties for processing. Pelmorex has established policies and procedures to comply with its own privacy code, and has designated one or more persons to be accountable for compliance.

Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes   
PMI will identify the purposes for collecting personal information, prior to or at the time it is being provided. Personal information will not be used for a purpose not previously identified without further individual consent, unless the new purpose is required by law.

Principle 3 - Consent   
The knowledge and consent of the customer are required for the collection, use or disclosure of customer information, except where inappropriate.

Principle 4 - Limiting Collection   
The collection of personal information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by PMI.

Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention   
Personal information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law. Personal information shall be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.

Principle 6 - Accuracy   
Personal information shall be as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used. 

Principle 7 - Safeguarding Customer Information   
Pelmorex protects personal information with safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.

Principle 8 - Openness   
Pelmorex will make specific information about its personal information management policies and practices readily available to individuals.

Principle 9 - Customer Access   
Upon request, Pelmorex will inform individuals of the existence, use, and disclosure of their personal information and provide access to that information. An individual shall be able to verify the accuracy and completeness of their information, and may request that it be amended, as appropriate.

Principle 10 - Handling Customer Complaints and Suggestions   
Pelmorex will provide procedures to receive and respond to complaints or inquiries about policies and practices relating to the handling of personal information. These procedures will be easily accessible and simple to use.

Where and Why We Collect Personal Information Online   
Currently PMI collects personal information from users when they register for WeatherDirect (an email program that delivers weather forecasts for free), sign up to add the 'Weather Button' on their site, or send us an email.

WeatherDirect   
[When an individual registers](https://web.archive.org/Inter/WeatherCentre) for WeatherDirect, they are required to provide their name, email address, and password. This information allows us to deliver weather forecasts to a subscriber’s email address and enables them to change their preferences associated with this program. We also ask subscribers for additional information, which is not required to participate in the email program. The purpose of gathering this optional information is twofold: 1) with a greater understanding of our users we can develop an email program even better suited to the needs of our subscribers and 2) to generate a statistical profile of all subscribers that is shared with advertisers on The Weather Network. Note that The Weather Network will not sell or share your email address or individual information with any third party.

When a subscriber cancels his or her subscription, that individual’s personal information (name and email address) will be deleted from our database within 30 days.

Weather Button   
When users sign up for the 'Weather Button' we request their name, email address, company name (if available) and website URL. The purpose of this is to be able to contact users of the button to communicate changes in the program as well as to track and check the sites they are implemented on to gauge the effectiveness of the program. This information will be retained for the life of the weather button program.

Email   
When you send us an email you provide us with your name (or tag) and email address, along with any other information you provide in the body of your email. This information may be shared with persons outside of The Weather Network only when they are required to receive this information in order to respond effectively to your query. We retain all email correspondence indefinitely in order to for purposes of reflecting upon our customer feedback.

Cookies   
Cookies are small text files transferred to your hard drive by a web server. Because cookies only contain text, they cannot transmit a virus or damage your system. They are commonly used to determine return visitors to a site, record your preferences, shopping cart, registration information, pages viewed or items purchased.

PMI only uses cookies on theweathernetwork.com cookies to allow users of the Golf Report to 'bookmark' their favourite course. No personal information is involved in providing this feature.

Our Advertising Representation firm, 24/7 Canada, uses sessional cookies (ones that expire once you turn off your computer) to execute advertising campaigns in order to limit repeat views of a banner for an individual user, or track the number of clicks a banner receives. These cookies do not, however, collect any personal data about who the cookies are served to. For more information regarding the use of cookies in advertising on TWN.com, please contact 24/7 at privacy@247canada.com or see their privacy policy here.

You have the option to set your browser to either accept cookies openly, to notify you before accepting cookies, or to refuse cookies altogether.

Employee Confidentiality   
Upon employment, every employee of The Weather Network is required to sign a "Confidentiality Agreement and Code of Ethics" that ensures the confidential handling of business information. This agreement demonstrates our commitment, both collectively and as individuals, to protecting the confidentiality of information held by the company, including specifically, "customer information."

Limitation of Liability   
Complete confidentiality and security is not yet possible over the Internet. Internet use and communication is subject to interception, loss and alteration. On whichever site you provide personal information, it is possible for a third party to view that information. It is not surprising, for example, that messages to newsgroups have resulted in unsolicited email from spammers. You acknowledge and agree that PMI and its affiliates and related companies shall not be responsible for any damages you may suffer as a result of the transmission of confidential or sensitive information over the Internet, and that all such communications will be at your own risk.
