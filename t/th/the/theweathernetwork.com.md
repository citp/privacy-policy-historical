In some cases, it may be optional for you to create an account, or consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, in order to access our Services across various platforms. In some cases, we may collect personal information from a third party with your consent or as otherwise permitted by law.

Where such parties are located outside of Canada, your personal information will be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction, including laws related to the disclosure of personal information to the authorities in that jurisdiction.

Below we describe in more detail how we collect, use and disclose information for certain Services.

### Automatically Collected Information

Some information concerning your use of the Services will be collected automatically as you use them, for example:

  * Internet Protocol ("IP") address used to connect your computer to the Internet;
  * Computer, device and connection information, such as browser type and version, operating system, mobile platform and unique device identifier (“UDID”) and other technical identifiers;
  * Location information for location-aware Services to provide you with more relevant content for where you are in the world.



We collect and use this information to generate aggregate/non-identifiable information in order to further develop, provide and manage the Services.

### Subscriptions

When you sign up for a Subscription (e.g. weather forecasts, pollen forecasts, alerts and other information delivered by e-mail), you are required to provide your name, e-mail address and password. This information is used to deliver weather forecasts to your e-mail address, contact you and administer your Subscription, and enable you to log in to manage your subscription.

We may also ask for additional, optional, information, which is not required to participate in the Subscription service. Such information may include your gender and year of birth. We collect and use this information in order to gain a better understanding of our subscribers to improve our Services, and to generate aggregate/non-identifiable demographic information which is shared with third party advertisers to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. To opt out of such use, please do not provide the optional information, or you may contact our Privacy Officer at any time as indicated below.

### Weather Widgets

We use this information to contact you to communicate changes in the Weather Widget Service, as well as to keep a record of what websites the Weather Widget is posted on.

### Posting photos and videos

When you sign up to upload images or videos to our Services, we will request your name, e-mail address, password and postal code. By signing up, providing this information and uploading photos or videos, you agree that PMI may publish your photos and videos on the Websites, on television, and otherwise in the Services, including with your name and location (e.g. city, town, or region, based on postal code). We may also use your email address to contact you to notify you if your picture or video is chosen to be displayed on any of the Services.

### Applications (‘apps’) and location information

When you download our location-enabled apps (e.g. Follow Me, which provides localized weather information based on the location of your device), you will normally be prompted to either permit or deny the app to use location information from your device. This choice can be changed later on in your device settings. If you deny permission for the app to use location services, the portions of the app that rely on location information will not function. If you permit the app to use location services, we may periodically collect information about the location of your device, which may include times when you are not directly interacting with the application. We may use this information to customize content and the Services, including public safety alerts and personalized notifications, to allow us to adapt the Services to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and to develop new features and Services. In addition, we may share non-identified location information with third parties for advertising use.
