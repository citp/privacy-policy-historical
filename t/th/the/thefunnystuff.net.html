  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>


  <p> Funniest Stuff has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your personally identifiable information at the Funniest Stuff's website.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our personal information collection and use practices and the choices that you can make concerning the use of your personal information.

  Funniest Stuff sends all new members a welcome email message to verify and confirm their registration 
  in our network.  Funniest Stuff also uses the emails it collects to send daily "Funny Video of the Day" newsletters.  Funniest Stuff does not sell or provide the emails it collects to 3rd parties.  Funniest Stuff stores its records in the United States of America but may perform some of its data processing outside of the United States of America. We will protect your information no matter where we process or store your data.</p>
  
  <p>You may occasionally receive quality special offers from our online partners, strictly without obligation of course,
 and only where you have opted in to do so. We will not release your personal information or email address to any other party,
 unless required to by law or unless you receive Funniest Stuff content via a co-branded "private-label" partnership.
 In that case, the private-label partner may also receive personal information about you and we encourage you to review that site's privacy
 policy as well.</p>

      application proxies, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network
      traffic to track abuse of our network and its data.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, when you submit information
      about yourself to Funniest Stuff over the Internet the information may travel
      over many systems that are not under the control of Funniest Stuff . To prevent

      of 18. Members under the age of 18 must have written parental consent to
      release their name, email address, or other personal information.</p>
