# Privacy Policy - The Awesomer

We take the privacy of our visitors very seriously. While we do use Google Analytics and SiteMeter to collect aggregate information on unique visits, pageviews, etc–this information is used to analyze overall traffic patterns only.

Visitors who submit information via our Contact, Suggest A Link or Email This forms will have their emails and IP addresses recorded; the former is so that we may reply to them if they have a question or comment, and the latter is to prevent spam. To maximize privacy, we make a policy of scrubbing these forms clean of data on a regular basis.

We will never sell or otherwise distribute your email address, IP address or any other identifying information to outside parties unless required by law.
