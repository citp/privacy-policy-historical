Visitors who submit information via our Contact, Suggest A Link or Email This forms will have their emails and IP addresses recorded; the former is so that we may reply to them if they have a question or comment, and the latter is to prevent spam. To maximize privacy, we make a policy of scrubbing these forms clean of data on a regular basis.

We will never sell or otherwise distribute your email address, IP address or any other identifying information to outside parties unless required by law.
