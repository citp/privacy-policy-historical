# Privacy Policy | TMR

TMR ("TMR") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting or using the TMR website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or any of our services offered from time to time by TMR in connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?  
This Privacy Policy covers TMR' treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that TMR gathers when you are accessing TMR' Website and when you use TMR services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that TMR does not own or control, or to individuals that TMR does not employ or manage.

WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES TMR COLLECT?  
The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Website. In connection with the Website, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of Website, which allows users to identify each other. We collect the following types of information from our customers.

**Personal Information You Provide to Us:**  
We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, user name, email address, IP address, and browser information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to interact with other users, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.

**Personal Information Collected Automatically:**  
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. TMR automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. TMR only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, TMR never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

**Email Communications:**  
We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from TMR if your computer supports this type of program. TMR uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please unsubscribe from the communication using the link provided in the footer of the email, this will blacklist you from further communications from us, with the exception of any administrative related notices.

**Mailing Lists:**  
TMR offers a free subscription to the TMR website. When you sign up to the TMR website, you may receive from time to time a newsletter as well as notifications of replies to comments you make on the website. Additional TMR mailing lists will be available for you as well. In order to sign up to receive regular emails from any website, users must submit information including a valid email address. 

Users who choose to sign up for this site will receive periodic newsletters, and separately, if users sign up for the new post notifications, they will also receive notifications when new posts are made on the site. These services are independent of each other, and a user can exist in either service, or both. If you do not wish to receive emails from TMR, you can unsubscribe at any time.

**What About Cookies?**  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. TMR cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Website's most attractive features.

Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies.
