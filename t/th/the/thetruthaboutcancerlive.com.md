# Privacy policy | The Truth About Cancer

This Website is operated by TTAC Publishing, LLC (“we” or “us”). The privacy policy below discloses our practices regarding information collection and usage solely for the website located at https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/ (the “Website”). This privacy policy does not apply to any other website or service provided by us, our affiliates or clients, unless it appears on such website or service. By using and visiting our Website and by submitting your personal information to us you agree to us using your personal information as set out in this privacy policy. If you do not agree to this privacy policy you may not access or otherwise use the Website or service.

##  **What information do we collect and how do we collect it?**

“Personal Information” is information that can specifically identify you. Categories of Personal Information we collect include:

  * Identity Data, which includes name or other similar identifiers.
  * Contact Data, which includes address, email address and telephone numbers.
  * Financial Data, which includes payment card details.



Additionally, we may also collect certain other types of information that, along with Identity Data, Contact Data, and Financial Data may be considered and specifically named “personal data” in certain jurisdictions, including the European Union (“EU”), such as:

  * Transaction Data, which includes details about payments.
  * Technical Data, which includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data.
  * Profile Data, whichincludesyour username and password, and information about your past purchases.
  * Usage Data, which includes information about how you use our web site and services.
  * Marketing and Communications Data, whichincludes your preferences in receiving marketing from us



IF YOU ARE SITUATED IN THE EU, PLEASE SEE THE SECTION “ADDITIONAL EU DISCLOSURES” THAT PERTAIN TO OUR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND ADDITIONAL RIGHTS YOU HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

Additionally, we may collect information that is not Personal Information (“Non-Personal Information”). We may aggregate Personal Information so that the aggregated information does not personally identify you or anyone else, such as by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our customers who live in a particular area (“Aggregate Information”). Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose permitted by law and subject to the section titled “Additional EU Disclosures”. In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information. If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information.

We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:

Direct interactions: Generally, we do not collect Personal Information unless you submit that information to us. This includes information you provide when you:

  * Become a member on our Website;
  * subscribe to our publications;
  * seek employment with us;
  * chat with us using your live chat feature;
  * respond to a survey;
  * fill out a form
  * request marketing to be sent to you; or
  * give us feedback.



Automated technologies or interactions: As you interact with our Website, we may automatically collect Technical Data and Usage Data about your. Some of the ways in which we or our Website may collect are further described below:

  *  **Cookies and other technologies:** The Website may use cookies, a type of technology that installs a small amount of information on a website user’s computer or other device to permit a website to, for example, recognize future visits using that computer or device. The Website may use other similar technologies (including, without limitation, tracking pixels, as described further below, and other anonymous identifiers) to gather information about you, such as IP addresses and location data, to customize your visit, to enable us to enhance our service, or for other purposes. Please see our Cookie Policy for further details.
  *  **Interest-Based Advertising:** We may engage third-party vendors to use your information in connection with their own information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit our Website or other websites. Cookies, described above, may be used in this process. For example, if you are searching for information on a particular product, our vendor may cause an advertisement to appear on other websites you view with information on that product. This form of advertising is called “behavioral advertising”. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see ads that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please see the Opt-Out section below.



##  **How do we use and share your information?**

Subject to the section titled “Additional EU Disclosures”, we use information held about you to perform our services and for other purposes outlined below. Any of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:

  * To personalize your experience

  * To process transactions



(Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.)

These third parties may have access to Personal Information necessary to perform their functions.

We will not sell your information to any third party not affiliated with us without your consent except in connection with the sale or merger of our company or the division responsible for such services.

##  **How long do we keep your information?**

We will only retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for your information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your information, the purposes for which we process your information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see _Request erasure_ below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymize information about you (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use and retain this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our Website or link to third party websites. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We do not operate or endorse these third party websites. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. This privacy policy does not apply to third party websites. When you link away from our Website, you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to read the policies and terms of every website you visit.

We may also integrate social networking services into the Website. You understand that we do not control such services and are not liable for the manner in which they operate. While we may provide you with the ability to use such services in connection with our Website, we are doing so merely as an accommodation and, like you, are relying upon those third party services to operate properly and fairly.

You should be aware that information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, social network or otherwise online may be viewed and used by others.

If you have a complaint, please contact our privacy manager at: legal@tnmllc.com.

Legal Basis:

  * Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
  * Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
  * Where you have consented to a certain use of your personal data.
  * Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.



To the extent permitted under applicable laws, we will also process, transfer, disclose and preserve personal data when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary.

Provision of personal data and failure to provide personal data:

Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with our services). In this case, we will not be able to provide services to you.

Data Subject Rights:

If you are a situated in the EU, under the GDPR as a data subject you have the right to:

  *  **Request access  **to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
  *  **Request correction  **of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
  *  **Request erasure  **of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
  *  **Object to processing  **of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
  *  **Request restriction of processing  **of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
  *  **Request the transfer  **of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.



To exercise your rights under the GDPR, please contact us at support@thetruthaboutcancer.com. Please note that in order for you to assert these rights, we may need to verify your identity to confirm your right to access your personal data. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. In order to verify your identity, we may need to gather more personal data from you than we currently have.
