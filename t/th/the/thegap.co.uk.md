Gap Companies and our brands want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.

Non-personal information is information that does not identify you. It may include information you have provided to us such as demographic data, for example, your gender, birthday, and personal interests.

For example, we may use cookies to enable you to use certain website features, store your preferences, recognize you when you return to our website, and monitor and maintain information about your use of our websites. Cookies may also be used to collect transaction information needed by a scrip or loyalty program to which you have authorized us to provide your personal information. (See the section entitled, "Do Gap Companies share my information?", above.) They may also be used to provide you with personalised advertisement banners while browsing other reputable sites. These advertisements will relate to products which have been viewed while browsing this website on your computer or any other device.

If you agree, we use "pixel tags" (also called "web beacons" or "clear gifs"), which are tiny graphic images, and other similar technologies on our websites and in our emails. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our websites and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information. Pixel tags on our sites may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the sites. This information may include your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to our site. Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us.

We may combine the information we collect through cookies and pixel tags with other information we have collected from you. This information may be used to improve our websites, to personalize your online experience, to tailor our communications with you, to determine the effectiveness of our advertising, to understand your preferences and for other internal business purposes.

We also work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. If you agree, these companies may collect information about your visits to our websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. We are committed to only providing you with information which is relevant to you and which you want to receive.

Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number may be different each time you log onto the Internet or it may remain the same. The IP address is logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit our websites, along with the time of your visit and the pages that you visited. It is also collected by pixel tags, as described above. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.

We may use IP addresses for the same purposes for which we use personal information, as well as for calculating website usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering our websites and your use of our websites including providing opportunities to you and fulfilling your requests and purchases. Except where otherwise required by law, we treat IP addresses, server log files and related information as non-personal information.

We have in place physical, electronic, contractual, and managerial safeguards to help protect the security and privacy of your personal information from unauthorized access, acquisition or disclosure. When you enter your personal information on our websites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your personal information as it is transmitted to us.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please do not send us sensitive information through email. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as described in the section entitled,["How do I contact you?"](https://web.archive.org/customerService/info.do?cid=2331#contact)below. If you choose to notify us by physical mail this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem.

We are aware of phony emails sent out under our brand names. These emails did not originate from Gap Inc., and individuals who received fraudulent order status emails have not been charged. For your protection, do not click links or open any files attached to suspicious, unsolicited emails. If you believe your personal computer has been compromised as a result of the scam, please consult an IT professional. For more information, contact the FBI's Internet Crimes Complaint Center:<http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx>. We work with law enforcement on their investigations of these kinds of fraudulent emails.

No. Gap Inc. does not ask prospective job applicants for information about their bank accounts, credit history or passwords to financial accounts. If you are asked for personal financial or security information in response to a job application, this is likely a fraudulent job listing hosted by spammers posing as Gap Inc. to mislead job applicants. You can validate all Gap Inc. job postings on gapinc.com/careers. Spammers also create phony aliases such as thegap-usa.com to mimic our company and/or brand names in an effort to commit identity theft or other forms of fraud. If you receive this type of suspicious email activity, please alert the FBI's Internet Crimes Complaint Center:<http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx>.

For your convenience and information, our websites may contain links to other sites, which may have privacy practices and policies that differ from our own.

The inclusion of a link to a third-party site on our websites does not imply that any of the Gap Companies endorses the site.

Hieronder staat in detail beschreven hoe we al deze persoonlijke informatie combineren met persoonlijke informatie die we over u verkrijgen van onze gezamenlijke marketingpartners, van niet-verbonden derden en van onze andere merken. 

Uw persoonlijke informatie kan worden verwerkt of opgeslagen op servers die in verschillende landen worden gehost, al dan niet binnen of buiten de Europese Economische Ruimte ("EER"). Dit betekent dus dat uw persoonlijke informatie kan worden overgebracht naar verschillende landen buiten de EER, waaronder de Verenigde Staten.

We kunnen uw persoonlijke informatie op de volgende manieren gebruiken: 

  * Om uw order te verwerken en uit te voeren, en om u e-mails te sturen ter bevestiging van de status en de verzending van uw order 
  * Om het retourneren van artikelen te verwerken 
  * Om wedstrijden, loyaliteitsprogramma's, en andere aanbiedingen en programma's waaraan u deelneemt, te beheren en uit te voeren

  * Om uw koopervaring te verbeteren 
  * Om te weten waar uw voorkeur naar uitgaat bij het winkelen

  * Voor onze interne zakelijke doeleinden, zoals het analyseren van trends en statistieken, voor audits, voor het ontwikkelen van nieuwe producten, voor verbetering van onze websites en onze diensten, voor het identificeren van gebruikerstrends en voor het vaststellen van de effectiviteit van onze promotiecampagnes.

We kunnen uw persoonlijke informatie op de volgende manieren doorgeven: 

  * Gap Bedrijven. Wanneer u persoonlijke informatie doorgeeft aan een van onze Gap Bedrijven, kunnen we deze informatie doorgeven aan onze andere Gap Bedrijven; zij kunnen deze informatie dan gebruiken voor de in dit privacybeleid beschreven doeleinden. 
  * Dienstverleners. We maken gebruik van de diensten van dienstverleners die in onze naam onze klanteninformatie beheren en diensten uitvoeren. We eisen van onze dienstverleners dat ze persoonlijke informatie goed beveiligen en de informatie alleen gebruiken voor dienstverlening aan ons.

We kunnen uw persoonlijke informatie doorgeven aan externe sponsors van wedstrijden, aanbiedingen, waardebon- en loyaliteitsprogramma's, of op een andere wijze overeenkomstig de op dergelijke wedstrijden, aanbiedingen of programma's van toepassing zijnde voorwaarden. U moet al deze voorwaarden zorgvuldig doornemen, want ze kunnen belangrijke informatie bevatten over het gebruik van uw persoonlijke informatie door een sponsor of een derde partij. Indien de voorwaarden strijdig zijn met dit privacybeleid, hebben de voorwaarden van dergelijke wedstrijden en programma's de bovenhand. Om zeker te zijn dat uw creditcard of betaalkaart niet worden gebruikt zonder uw toestemming, kan het zijn dat we ook naam, adres en andere persoonlijke informatie die u hebt gegeven, tijdens de orderverwerking controleren in toepasselijke databases van derden. Wanneer we vermoeden dat er fraude of identiteitsfraude in het spel is, kunnen we dit registreren en dergelijke gegevens bewaren voor fraudepreventie in de toekomst. Wanneer u dit privacybeleid accepteert, stemt u toe in deze verwerking, opslag en gebruik. 
  * Zakelijke transacties. In het onwaarschijnlijke geval van een reorganisatie, fusie, joint venture, toewijzing, overdracht of een andere beschikking van welke aard ook van het volledige of gedeeltelijke bedrijf, de activa of aandelen van de Gap Bedrijven of eender welk van onze bedrijven, kan persoonlijke informatie over onze klanten en andere informatie die we zoals in dit beleid beschreven hebben verzameld, deel uitmaken van de overgedragen zakelijke activa en worden doorgegeven aan andere relevante partijen.

    6. voor het ten uitvoer brengen van de gebruiksvoorwaarden van onze websites of de voorwaarden van wedstrijden, aanbiedingen of programma's; of 
    7. voor naleving van de wet of een wettelijke procedure.

Gap Bedrijven en onze merken willen alleen met u communiceren als u dat zelf wilt. Als u liever geen promotionele informatie ontvangt, zoals informatie over speciale aanbiedingen en koopjesdagen, van een of meer van onze merken, dan kunt u dit aan ons melden. Hiervoor neemt u contact op met onze klantendienst en volgt u de aanwijzingen in de onderstaande rubriek "Hoe neem ik met u contact op?" Of u kunt de instructies voor "opt out" volgen in de promotionele e-mails die u krijgt. 

Zorg dat u uw volledige naam opgeeft en het e-mailadres dat u hebt gebruikt bij registratie of wanneer u producten van onze merken hebt aangeschaft. Als u vraagt uw naam en adres van onze promotionele lijsten te verwijderen, bewaren we uw naam in een "geen contact opnemen" bestand, om aan uw wens te voldoen. 

Wanneer u zich bedenkt, kunt u weer promotionele berichten van ons ontvangen door daarvoor in te schrijven wanneer u onze websites of onze winkels bezoekt, of wanneer u meedoet aan sweepstakes of wedstrijden, of door contact op te nemen met de klantendienst.

Onze websites zijn niet bestemd voor gebruik door kinderen. We vragen dat kinderen jonger dan 18 jaar ons geen persoonlijke informatie doorsturen. Waar dit specifiek wordt gevraagd, willen we dat de ouder of voogd van een minderjarig kind de relevante informatie over het kind opgeeft.

Niet-persoonlijke informatie is informatie die u niet identificeert. Dit kan informatie zijn die u hebt doorgegeven zoals demografische gegevens, bijvoorbeeld uw geslacht, geboortedatum en persoonlijke interesses. Niet-persoonlijke informatie is ook samengevoegde informatie, bijvoorbeeld persoonlijke informatie die werd gebruikt voor de berekening van het percentage klanten dat een bepaald merk leuk vindt. 

Wanneer u onze websites bezoekt, verzamelen Gap Bedrijven niet-persoonlijke informatie over u, zoals uw MAC-adres, uw computertype, schermresolutie, de versie van uw besturingssysteem, uw internetbrowser, IP-adres (verder meer hierover), cookies (verder meer hierover), pixeltags, webbakens en andere vergelijkbare technologieën (verder meer hierover) om u beter van dienst te zijn met informatie op maat, voor een vlot gebruik van onze websites. 

Gap Bedrijven kunnen ook niet-persoonlijke informatie gebruiken en niet-persoonlijke informatie doorgeven aan derden voor welk doel ook. Gap Bedrijven kunnen niet-persoonlijke informatie met persoonlijke informatie combineren, zoals de combinatie van uw geografische locatie met uw naam. Wanneer we dit doen, zal deze informatie, zolang ze gecombineerd is, door ons worden behandeld als persoonlijke informatie.

Onze websites maken gebruik van "cookies". Dit zijn kleine gegevensbestanden die op uw computer worden geplaatst wanneer u een website bezoekt. Cookies kunnen op heel wat manieren worden gebruikt om uw online ervaring te verbeteren of te personaliseren. Bijvoorbeeld, we maken gebruik van cookies om u bepaalde functies van de website te laten gebruiken, uw voorkeuren op te slaan, u te herkennen wanneer u naar onze website terugkeert, en informatie over uw gebruik van onze websites te monitoren en bij te houden. Cookies kunnen ook worden gebruikt om transactiegegevens te verzamelen voor waardebon- of loyaliteitsprogramma's waarvoor u ons toestemming voor het gebruik van uw persoonlijke informatie hebt gegeven. (Zie de bovenstaande rubriek "Geven Gap Bedrijven mijn informatie door aan anderen?") Ze worden ook gebruikt om u gepersonaliseerde advertentiebanners aan te bieden terwijl u andere betrouwbare websites bezoekt. Dit zullen advertenties zijn met betrekking tot producten die u op deze website hebt bekeken op uw computer of op een ander apparaat. We stellen alles in het werk om u alleen informatie te bieden die voor u relevant is en die u wenst te ontvangen. U kunt uw browser ook zo instellen dat cookies niet worden geaccepteer, of dat  u een seintje ontvangt wanneer u een cookie wordt toegestuurd. Zo kunt u zelf beslissen of u cookies accepteert of niet. Als u echter geen cookies accepteert, is het mogelijk dat bepaalde functies van onze websites niet voor u beschikbaar zijn. Meer over cookies vindt u op <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>.

We maken gebruik van "pixeltags" (heel kleine grafische afbeeldingen die ook "webbakens" of "clear gifs" worden genoemd) en andere vergelijkbare technologieën op onze websites en in onze e-mails. Pixeltags helpen ons het online klantgedrag te analyseren en de doeltreffendheid van onze websites en onze reclame te meten. We werken met dienstverleners die ons helpen deze informatie bij te houden, te verzamelen en te analyseren. Pixeltags op onze sites kunnen worden gebruikt om informatie te verzamelen over uw bezoek, bijvoorbeeld de pagina's die u bekijkt, de functies waarvan u gebruikmaakt, de koppelingen die u aanklikt en andere zaken die u doet op de sites. Deze informatie kan uw browsertype, uw besturingssysteem, datum en tijd, en andere technische informatie over uw computer bevatten. We kunnen ook bepaalde informatie volgen over de identiteit van de website die u net vóór onze website hebt bezocht. Pixeltags en cookies in onze e-mails kunnen worden gebruikt om uw interacties met deze berichten te volgen, bijvoorbeeld wanneer u het bericht hebt geopend of op een koppeling in een van onze e-mails hebt geklikt. 

We kunnen de via cookies en pixeltags verzamelde informatie combineren met andere over u verzamelde informatie. Deze informatie kan worden gebruikt om onze websites te verbeteren, uw online ervaring te verbeteren, communicatie op maat met u te verzorgen, de doeltreffendheid van onze reclame te meten, uw voorkeuren te bepalen en voor andere interne zakelijke doeleinden. 

We werken ook met derde bedrijven die traceringstechnologieën toepassen om in onze naam reclame te maken op het internet. Deze bedrijven kunnen informatie verzamelen over uw bezoeken aan onze websites en over uw interactie met onze reclame en andere communicatie. We stellen alles in het werk om u alleen informatie te bieden die voor u relevant is en die u wenst te ontvangen. Als u meer informatie wenst over deze praktijken of meer wilt weten over uw keuzemogelijkheden om deze informatie niet te laten gebruiken door deze bedrijven, ga naar <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

Uw IP-adres is een getal dat automatisch door uw internetprovider (ISP) aan uw computer wordt toegekend. Dit getal kan telkens u inlogt op het internet veranderen, of het kan ook hetzelfde blijven. Het IP-adres wordt automatisch vastgelegd in onze serverlogbestanden telkens als u onze websites bezoekt, samen met de tijd van uw bezoek en de pagina's die u hebt bekeken. Dit wordt ook met pixeltags verzameld, zoals hierboven werd uiteengezet. Het verzamelen van IP-adressen is een standaardpraktijk op het internet en wordt door heel wat websites automatisch gedaan. 

We kunnen IP-adressen gebruiken voor dezelfde doeleinden als waarvoor we uw persoonlijke informatie gebruiken, en ook voor het berekenen van websitegebruik, het diagnosticeren van serverproblemen en het beheren van onze websites en uw gebruik van onze websites, met inbegrip van het doen van aanbiedingen en het uitvoeren van uw verzoeken en aankopen. Behalve wanneer anders vereist door de wet, behandelen we IP-adressen, serverlogbestanden en gerelateerde informatie, als niet-persoonlijke informatie.

We hebben fysieke, elektronische, contractuele en bestuurlijke beveiligingsmechanismen ingesteld ter bescherming van de veiligheid en vertrouwelijkheid van uw persoonlijke informatie tegen ongeoorloofde inzage, verwerving of openbaarmaking. Wanneer u uw persoonlijke informatie op onze websites invoert, gebruiken we SSL-technologie (Secure Sockets Layer) ter bescherming van uw persoonlijke informatie terwijl die aan ons wordt doorgegeven. 

Helaas kan voor geen enkele gegevensoverdracht over het internet noch voor enig gegevensopslagsysteem een 100% veiligheidsgarantie worden geboden. Stuur ons geen gevoelige informatie via e-mail. Als u redenen hebt om te vermoeden dat uw interactie met ons niet langer veilig is, moet u ons onmiddellijk op de hoogte stellen van het probleem. Hiervoor neemt u contact met ons op volgens de aanwijzingen in het gedeelte "Hoe neem ik contact met u op?" hieronder. Als u er de voorkeur aan geeft om ons op de hoogte te stellen via de gewone post, zal onze reactie op het probleem wel vertraging oplopen.

Voor uw gemak en informatie kunnen onze websites koppelingen bevatten naar andere sites, die er mogelijk andere praktijken en een ander beleid inzake privacy op nahouden dan wijzelf. We zijn niet verantwoordelijk voor de inhoud of de praktijken van gekoppelde sites. We raden u aan het privacybeleid te lezen van de sites die u via onze site aanklikt. De aanwezigheid van een koppeling naar een site van derden op onze website betekent geenszins dat Gap Bedrijven de site ondersteunt.

We zullen uw persoonlijke informatie bewaren zolang dit nodig is voor de in dit beleid samengevatte doeleinden, tenzij een langere bewaarperiode vereist of toegestaan is door de wet.

Wir wissen, dass im Namen unserer Marken betrügerische E-Mails verschickt werden. Diese E-Mails stammen nicht von Gap Inc. und Personen, die betrügerische E-Mails zu Ihrem Bestellstatus erhalten haben, wurde in Wirklichkeit nichts in Rechnung gestellt.

Wenn Sie Grund zur Annahme haben, dass Ihr PC durch den Betrugsversuch beschädigt wurde, wenden Sie sich bitte an einen Computerfachmann.  Für ausführlichere Informationen kontaktieren Sie bitte das Internet Crimes Complaint Center des FBI: http.

Nein. Gap Inc. bittet Kandidaten für vakante Stellen nicht um Informationen zu ihren Bankkonten, ihrer Kredithistorie oder Passwörter für Bankkonten. Wenn Sie in Zusammenhang mit einer Bewerbung um persönliche Finanz- oder Sicherheitsdaten gebeten werden, handelt es sich mit Wahrscheinlichkeit um ein betrügerisches Jobangebot, das von Spammern im Namen von Gap Inc. eingestellt wurde, um potenzielle Bewerber zu täuschen. _ _ Sie können alle Jobangebote von Gap Inc. unter gapinc.com/careers überprüfen.  Spammer erstellen häufig auch betrügerische Aliase wie etwa thegap-usa.com, um die Namen unseres Unternehmens und/oder Marken nachzuahmen und somit Identitätsdiebstahl zu betreiben oder anderen betrügerischen Aktivitäten nachzugehen. Wenn Sie Opfer einer solchen betrügerischen E-Mail-Aktivität geworden sind, informieren Sie bitte das Internet Crimes Complaint Center des FBI: http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx

Nuestros sitios web no están dirigidos ni diseñados para niños. Pedimos que los niños menores de 18 años no nos transmitan ninguna información personal. Cuando se pida específicamente, agradecemos que sean los padres o tutores de un menor de 18 años los que proporcionan información pertinente sobre el niño.

La información no personal es la que no le identifica. Puede incluir información que nos haya proporcionado, como datos demográficos (género, fecha de nacimiento e intereses personales, por ejemplo). La información no personal incluye también información agregada, por ejemplo, el uso de información personal para calcular el porcentaje de nuestros clientes a los que les gusta una marca concreta. 

Cuando visita nuestros sitios web, las empresas Gap recopilan información no personal que puede incluir su dirección MAC, su tipo de equipo informático, la resolución de su pantalla, la versión de su SO, el navegador de Internet, la dirección IP (como se explicará con más detalle a continuación), las cookies (como se explicará con más detalle a continuación), contadores de visitantes y otras tecnologías similares (como se explicará con más detalle a continuación) para proporcionarle un mejor servicio con información más adaptada a sus gustos y facilitar el uso continuado de nuestros sitios web. 

Las empresas Gap pueden usar información no personal y compartirla con terceros para cualquier fin. Las empresas Gap pueden combinar información no personal con información personal, por ejemplo, su ubicación geográfica con su nombre, pero en caso de hacerlo, trataremos la información como información personal durante todo el tiempo en que esté combinada.

Nuestros sitios web utilizan "cookies," que son pequeños archivos de datos que se almacenan en su equipo cuando visita un sitio web. Las cookies pueden usarse de muy diversos modos para mejorar o personalizar su experiencia en línea. Por ejemplo, podemos usar cookies para permitirle usar ciertas funciones del sitio web, almacenar sus preferencias, reconocerle cuando vuelve a nuestro sitio web, y supervisar y mantener información sobre el uso que haga de nuestros sitios web. Las cookies pueden usarse también para recopilar información necesaria por un programa de suscripción o fidelización para el que nos haya autorizado a proporcionar su información personal. (Consulte la sección "¿Comparten las empresas Gap información personal sobre mí?", más arriba.) También pueden usarse para proporcionarle anuncios de publicidad personalizados mientras navega por otros sitios de confianza. Estos anuncios estarán relacionados con productos que haya visto mientras navega por este sitio web en su equipo o en cualquier otro dispositivo. Nos comprometemos a proporcionarle sólo la información que pueda serle pertinente y que desee recibir. En consecuencia, puede configurar su navegador para que no acepte cookies o para que le avise cuando se le envíe una cookie, con lo que tendrá la oportunidad de decidir aceptarla o no. Si no acepta cookies, no obstante, es posible que no encuentre disponibles ciertas funciones de nuestros sitios web.

Utilizamos "contadores de visitantes" (también llamados “web beacons” o "clear GIF"), que son diminutas imágenes gráficas, y otras tecnologías similares en nuestros sitios web y nuestros correos electrónicos. Los contadores de visitas nos ayudan a analizar el comportamiento en línea de nuestros clientes y a medir la eficacia de nuestros sitios web y nuestra publicidad. Trabajamos con proveedores de servicios que nos ayudan a realizar el seguimiento de esta información, recopilarla y analizarla. Los contadores de visitas en nuestros sitios pueden usarse para recopilar información sobre su visita, incluidas las páginas que vio, las funciones que usó, los enlaces en los que hizo clic y otras acciones que emprendiera en relación con los sitios. Esta información puede incluir su tipo de navegador, su sistema operativo, información de fecha y hora y otra información técnica sobre su equipo. También podemos realizar el seguimiento de cierta información sobre la identidad del sitio web que visitó inmediatamente antes de llegar a nuestro sitio. Los contadores de visitas y las cookies de nuestros correos electrónicos pueden usarse para realizar el seguimiento de sus interacciones con dichos mensajes como, por ejemplo, cuando recibió, abrió o hizo clic en un enlace presente en un correo electrónico recibido de nosotros. 

Podemos combinar la información que recopilamos a través de cookies y contadores de visitas con otra información que hayamos recopilado de usted. Esta información puede usarse para mejorar nuestros sitios web, personalizar su experiencia en línea, adaptar nuestros comunicados a usted, determinar la eficacia de nuestra publicidad, comprender sus preferencias y para otros fines empresariales internos. 

También trabajamos con terceras empresas que usan tecnologías de seguimiento para proporcionar anuncios en nombre nuestro a través de Internet. Estas empresas pueden recopilar información sobre sus visitas a nuestros sitios web y su interacción con nuestra publicidad y otras comunicaciones. Nos comprometemos a proporcionarle sólo la información que pueda serle pertinente y que desee recibir. En consecuencia, si desea recibir más información sobre esta práctica y sobre las opciones con las que cuenta para impedir que estas empresas usen su información, visite <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

Su dirección IP es un número que un proveedor de servicios de Internet (ISP) asigna automáticamente a su equipo informático. Este número puede diferir cada vez que inicia sesión en Internet o puede seguir siendo el mismo. La dirección IP se registra automáticamente en los archivos de registro de nuestro servidor cada vez que visita nuestros sitios web, junto con la hora de su visita y las páginas que visitó. También la recopilan los contadores de visitas, tal y como se ha explicado arriba. La recogida de direcciones IP es una práctica estándar en Internet y muchos sitios web la realizan de forma automática. 

Podemos usar direcciones IP para los mismos propósitos para los que usamos la información personal, además de para calcular los niveles de uso del sitio web, ayudarnos a diagnosticar problemas del servidor y administrar nuestros sitios web y su uso de ellos. En este último apartado incluimos el proporcionarle oportunidades como cliente y el satisfacer sus solicitudes y compras. Excepto si la ley establece lo contrario, tratamos las direcciones IP, los archivos de registro de los servidores y la información relacionada como información no personal.

Hemos implementado salvaguardas físicas, electrónicas, contractuales y directivas para ayudar a proteger la seguridad y privacidad de su información personal frente a apropiación, divulgación o accesos no autorizados. Cuando especifica su información personal en nuestros sitios web, usamos tecnología Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) para protegerla durante el proceso de transmisión.

Lamentablemente, no es posible garantizar con el 100% de seguridad la transmisión de datos a través de Internet o los sistemas de almacenamiento de datos. No nos envíe información confidencial a través del correo electrónico. Si tiene motivos para creer que su interacción con nosotros ha dejado de ser segura, deberá avisarnos inmediatamente del problema poniéndose en contacto con nosotros según lo descrito en la sección "¿Cómo me pongo en contacto con ustedes?" que encontrará más adelante. Si opta por avisarnos mediante correo físico, supondrá un retraso en el tiempo que nos lleva responder al problema.

No. Gap Inc. no pide a los candidatos información sobre cuentas bancarias, historial de créditos o contraseñas de cuentas financieras. Si alguien le pide datos financieros o de seguridad personales en respuesta a una solicitud laboral, lo más probable es que se trate de una oferta falsa enviada por individuos que utilizan el nombre Gap Inc. _  _Puede comprobar la veracidad de todas las ofertas de Gap Inc. en gapinc.com/careers. Los piratas informáticos también crean alias falsos como thegap-usa.com para imitar nuestra empresa y las distintas marcas y robar identidades o cometer delitos similares. Si recibe este tipo de actividad sospechosa, informe inmediatamente al Centro de Reclamaciones de Delitos Cibernéticos (Internet Crimes Complaint Center) del FBI: http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx
