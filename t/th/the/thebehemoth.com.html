<br><br>
<font style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b>1. Information The Behemoth Collects:</b></font>

Personal information is information that is not otherwise publicly available, and may include such things as your first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address, and other information that you provide to us. If you choose to correspond with The Behemoth through e-mail, The Behemoth reserves the right to retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and The Behemoth's responses. Do not submit information that you do not want The Behemoth to access.  As further described below, we may also collect non-personal information when you interact with the Site and Service such as information about your usage of the Site and Service.
<br><br>
<font style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b>2.	How The Behemoth Uses Your Information:</b></font>

<font style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b>3.	How The Behemoth Discloses Your Information to Third Parties:</b></font>
<br><br>
The Behemoth may disclose personal information as necessary to operate the Service, including in response to law enforcement activity, to enforce its contract or property rights, or when required by law. 
<br><br>
Information collected may also be transferred in connection with the sale or merger of the company (or substantially all of its assets) or any division or business line of the company to which the information relates or to any subsequent operator of the Site or Service.
<br><br>
The Behemoth may hire third parties to perform services on its behalf in connection with operating the Site or Service in accordance with applicable law.

<br><br>
In those cases where de-identified data is shared with third parties, the third parties will not be able to identify any individual user of the Site or Service based on the disclosures.  
<br><br>
<font style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b>4.	Passive information collection:</b></font>
<br><br>
The Behemoth may use different technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, and location-identifying technologies, to passively collect information.  The information collected might include the date and time you visit the Site, logs from your browser or your use of the Service, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the pages you requested.  This information will usually be used to (i) customize the advertising and content you see, (ii) process and confirm your entries and order information, (iii) contact you, (iv) enhance your experience, and/or (v) improve our general user experience. Your browser must be set up to accept cookies in order to fully utilize certain areas of the Site.

The Behemoth reserves the right to compile, save and use such information within the scope of The Behemoth's business activities, and analyze any and all of the data collected in this manner. The data collected by The Behemoth may be posted on websites accessible to the public; shared with console manufacturers, software developers, and/or marketing partners; or used by The Behemoth for any other lawful purpose. By using the Site and Service you consent to The Behemoth's use of the data The Behemoth collects, including the public display of information such as your user ID, your user created content or any other gameplay data. The Behemoth may also use such information for statistical purposes, the public display of user statistics and/or game rankings, to improve your game play experience, to provide you with advertisements or information that might be of interest to you, and any other reasonable purpose, at The Behemoth's sole discretion.
<br><br>
<font style="margin:0px 0px 0px 40px;"><b>5.	Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track.</b></font>
<br><br>
There may be tracking technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site and Service.  Further, third parties may use tracking technologies in connection with our Site and Service, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.

For more information on our vendors, and their Tracking Technologies see the chart at the end of this policy.    
<br><br>
Your browser or other third party mechanisms may be able to allow you to signal or otherwise express your choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals).  Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these 'do not track' signals or other mechanisms.
