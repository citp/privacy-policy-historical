Most people do not know that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit The Chennai Silks.com site or most web sites because browsers are typically set to accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placement. If you refuse cookies, you will not be able to open a The Chennai Silks.com Shopping Cart and therefore will not be able to complete an order with us online.
