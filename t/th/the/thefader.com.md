### 3\. Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies

The FADER uses cookies and other similar technologies (e.g., web tags, pixel tags, clear GIFs, and web beacons, etc.) (collectively, "cookies") to personalize your experience on The FADER Websites. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer or mobile device which are uniquely assigned to individual users, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued such cookies. Some cookies are essential to your use and enjoyment of The FADER Websites. Among the primary purposes of these essential cookies is to indicate to our web server that a particular user has returned to a specific page and to enable our web servers to “remember” such users from prior visits and any preferences such users may have previously established. Other cookies are used to help us conduct research and analysis about your use of The FADER Websites. The FADER may also use advertising cookies to deliver ads to you that you may be more interested in.

The FADER’s cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other Personal Data, so users remain anonymous.

The FADER may provide space on The FADER Websites to third-party advertisers. Those authorized third-party advertisers may use targeting and advertising cookies to collect information about your use of The FADER Websites so that they may deliver ads to you that may be more relevant to you. The FADER does not control these third-parties cookies, so please refer to the relevant third party's website for more information on how those third-party cookies are used.

You have the ability and the right to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies or you may purchase third-party programs that provide such functionality. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience certain features on The FADER Websites.

### 10\. The FADER Online Store

The FADER online store (www.shop.thefader.com) is hosted on Shopify Inc. Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.

Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. Shopify stores your data on a secure server behind a firewall.

If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.

All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.

Shopify also allows you to make purchases of our products using your PayPal account. PayPal uses encryption and other technologies to secure your personal information. For more information on PayPal's security measures, please visit https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security.

You understand and agree that it is solely your responsibility to visit this page (www.thefader.com/privacy-policy) periodically to learn of changes and updates to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of The FADER Websites following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance by you of such changes.
