    </p>


    <h2 id="section4">IV. General information on data processing </h2>

    <h3>1.	Scope of personal data processing </h3>

    <p>
        In general, we record only the personal data which you disclose when using Services as part of your login or registration and possibly during use of fee-based services. Personal data are those which contain information about personal or factual circumstances. When logging in and registering as a user on our website, you only have to provide an email address and, if applicable, a username and password. When registering for certain Services, email addresses are not collected during registration but only later during the use of the Service. The password is stored in hasehd form, which never allows for an inference of the actual password.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the context of implementing the concluded user contract, particularly in the context of fee-based Services you have chosen, the disclosure of further data, such as the full name, address, account details, credit card numbers, etc., may be required. It is sometimes also necessary to request personal information such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number for the purposes of processing your inquiries or providing you with support. InnoGames will handle these data confidentially and in compliance with the legal data protection provisions. In principle, InnoGames will not disclose such information to third parties without your permission, unless this is required for the implementation and execution of the contract, for processing your request or for your support or in the case of a legal permit. 
    </p>

    <h3>2.	Legal basis for personal data processing</h3>

    <p>
        Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, Art. 6(1)(a) of EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for personal data processing.
    </p>
    <p>
        In personal data processing required for the fulfilment of a contract of which the data subject is a party, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to the processing required in order to carry out pre-contractual actions.
    </p>
    <p>
       Insofar as personal data processing is required for the fulfilment of a legal obligation which our company is subject to, Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require personal data processing, Art. 6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If processing is required to protect the legitimate interests of our company or of a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the interests mentioned first, Art. 6(1)(f) serves as the legal basis for processing. 
    </p>

    <h3>3.	Deletion of data and duration of storage</h3>

    <p>
        The personal data of the data subject are deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer exists. In addition, such storage may occur if this is provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. The blocking or deletion of data also occurs when the storage period prescribed in the abovementioned regulations lapses, unless further storage of the data is required for conclusion or fulfilment of a contract. 
    </p>

    <h3>4.	Data security</h3>

    <p>
        InnoGames makes reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorised access to your personal data as well as unauthorised use or falsification of these data and to minimise the corresponding risks. However, the provision of personal data, whether it be in person, over the phone or over the Internet, always involves risks and no technological system is completely free of the possibility of being manipulated or sabotaged.
    </p>
    <p>
        InnoGames processes the information collected from you in accordance with German and European data protection law. All employees are obliged to comply with data secrecy and data protection provisions and are instructed in this regard. Your data are transmitted in an en-crypted form using the SSL method.
    </p>


    <h2 id="section5">V. Provision of our services and creation of log files</h2>

    <h3>1.	Description and scope of data processing</h3>

    <p>
        Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The following data are collected here:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Internet protocol</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>URL of the referring website from which the file was requested</li>
        <li>Date and time of access</li>
        <li>Browser type and operating system</li>
        <li>the page visited by you</li>
        <li>amount of transferred data</li>
        <li>access status (file transferred, file not found etc.),</li>
        <li>duration and frequency of use</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The data is also stored in the log files of our system. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When accessing mobile apps, the following data and information are collected:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Internet protocol</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>date and time of access</li>
        <li>device type and operating system</li>
        <li>amount of transferred data</li>
        <li>access status (file transferred, file not found etc.),</li>
        <li>duration and frequency of use</li>
        <li>Google Play IDs and Game Center IDs can possibly be stored to log you in to several devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If an error occurs during the use of our Services and we want to rectify this, we may also col-lect other data, e.g. Player ID and username. 
    </p>

    <h3>2.	Legal basis for data processing </h3>

    <p>
        The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is provided by Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>3.	Purpose of data processing</h3>

    <p>
       The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to allow delivery of the Services to the computer of the user. For this purpose, the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the Services. In addition, the data is used by us in order to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. Evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context. Only a statistical evaluation of datasets takes place. 
    </p>
    <p>
        InnoGames reserves the right to store IP addresses and log files for a maximum period of 30 days after the website is used to monitor compliance with the terms of use and rules of the game. In particular, this procedure is used to prevent any cases of abuse or to resolve them and, on a case-by-case basis, to pass on the data for this purpose to investigative authorities. Apart from that, any other analysis of data is done in anonymous form as much as possible. After the end of this period, the IP address and log files are completely deleted, unless there are mandatory statutory storage requirements or specific prosecution- and abuse investigation proceedings pending. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These purposes also constitute our legitimate and predominant interest in data processing according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. 	
    </p>

    <h3>4.	Storage duration</h3>

    <p>
        The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to fulfil the purpose of their collection. In the case when data are collected for the purpose of making the website availa-ble, this is the case when the respective session is over. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Log files which contain personal data are generally deleted after seven days at the latest. Ad-ditional storage is possible in the case of so-called error logs which allow us to fix errors. These error logs are deleted after maximum 30 days, collected IP addresses are anonymised after 30 days.
    </p>

    <h3>5.	Possibility of objection and removal</h3>

    <p>
       The collection of data for the purpose of making the website available and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. As a consequence, there is no objection possibility on the part of the user. 
    </p>


    <h2 id="section6">VI.	Inquiries via contact form, email, and support tool</h2>

    <h3>1.	Description and scope of data processing</h3>

    <h4>a)	Contact form </h4>

    <p>
        On our website, a contact form is available which can be used to contact us electronically. Should a user choose this option, the data entered in the input mask will be transmitted to us and stored. These data are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Message</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Additionally, at the point of sending the message, the following data are stored:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address of the user</li>
        <li>Date and time of submission</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For the processing of the data, reference is made to this privacy policy in the context of the submission process.
    </p>

    <h4>b) Email</h4>

    <p>
        Alternatively, it is possible to contact us via our provided email addresses. In this case, the personal data of the user transmitted with the email are stored. 
    </p>

    <h4>c)	Support tool</h4>

    <p>
        Alternatively, you can contact us via our support tool integrated into our Service. It will then store your user data and the content of the support inquiry as well as the time of the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
        No data are transmitted to third parties in this context. The data are used exclusively for the processing of the conversation. 
    </p>

    <h3>2.	Legal basis </h3>

    <p>
        Legal basis for data processing is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If the e-mail contact is aimed to conclude a contract or serves the contract execution, additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>3.	Aim of data processing</h3>
    <p>
        The processing of the personal data serves us only to process the contact and the support request. The other personal data processed during the submission process serve to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
    </p>

    <h3>4.	Storage duration</h3>
    <p>
        The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to fulfil the purpose of their collection. 
    </p>

    <h3>5.	Possibility of objection and removal</h3>
    <p>
        At any time after contacting us, you have the option to object to personal data processing, regardless of whether this was done via a contact form, email or support tool. In such a case, the conversation cannot continue and your concern may not be conclusively handled. All per-sonal data stored in the course of contacting will be deleted in this case. This shall not apply if mandatory statutory retention requirements preclude this.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section7">VII.	Submission of newsletters</h2>

    <p>
        You can subscribe on our websites or in our games for a newsletter on the respective game. For this, we require your email address. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we must verify, taking into consideration the relevant legal regulations, that you are the actual owner of the provided email address and wish to receive the newsletter. For this purpose, we send you a validation email. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Our newsletters contain a pixel-size image (tracking pixels), which is retrieved by a server of the newsletter sender when the newsletter is opened. As part of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about your browser or operating system, as well as your IP address, location, and time of retrieval, is collected. This information is anonymised and evaluated independently of the individual. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the submission and receipt of the newsletter depend on your consent, you can revoke this consent for collection and storage of your data at any time without providing the reasons for it. For this purpose, use the unsubscribe link which can be found at the end of our newsletter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, you have the option to opt-out of receiving newsletters in the Data Usage Window inside any of our games under “Settings”.
    </p>

You can manage push notifications on the page “Options” or “Settings” in the mobile app or in the settings of your device.
    </p>

    <h3>2.	Legal basis for data processing </h3>

    <p>
        The legal basis for data processing in the presence of a contract is according to Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>3.	Purpose of data processing </h3>

    <p>
        Push notifications are special notifications which are displayed directly on your mobile device. The notifications contain, for instance, the information that one of your buildings in the game has been completed. As a rule, push notifications contain short messages which focus on the essential.
    </p>

    <h3>4.	Storage duration</h3>

    </p>
    <p>

    <h2 id="section13">XIII.	Use of third-party advertising services</h2>

    <h3>1.	General information</h3>

    <p>
        The website may occasionally contain advertisements from third parties and interactive links to third-party websites for which we are not responsible. In particular, we have no influence whatsoever on the content and design of the external sites linked to the websites to which you may be directed via these sites. The respective providers are exclusively responsible for the content and design of these websites as well as compliance with data protection regulations. Advertisers occasionally use technologies that send advertisements that appear on our websites directly to your browser, automatically transmitting your IP address. The advertisers concerned sometimes also use cookies and other technical means to measure the efficiency of their advertising or to optimise their content. This applies in particular, but not exclusively, to the classification of websites to certain interest categories within the scope of your Internet use. No connection will be established between this information and your name, address, telephone number or email address. We have no influence on that. The handling of data by these third parties is therefore not covered by this data protection declaration. Therefore, please contact the respective provider directly for information on their data protection regulations. You can disable the use of cookies in your browser settings (see above).
    </p>
    <p>
        We forward your anonymised Device ID (IDentifier For Advertisers - IDFA or Google Advertiser ID - GAID) to some of our marketing partners within and outside of Europe (e.g. in the USA), in order to generate advertising for certain user groups with the help of our partners or to exclude users from certain advertising efforts. You can revoke data collection, storage, and transfer by applying your mobile device settings as described above.
    </p>

    <h3>2.	AppNexus</h3>
    <p>
        InnoGames uses the advertising display services of the external vendor AppNexus Inc., 28 West 23rd Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10010, USA, 
        <a href="https://www.appnexus.com" target="_blank">https://www.appnexus.com</a> („AppNexus“). 
        For this purpose, we have implemented the AppNexus tracking pixel (i.e. a code snippet) on our website. The tracking pixel allows players' actions to be tracked on our website. No personal reference is established. Only statistical information is collected and transmitted to Ap-pNexus. This is intended to optimise advertising campaigns and to broadcast advertisements of interest to Internet users. Should wish otherwise, you can disable the AppNexus tracking by tapping the opt-out button at 
        <a href="https://www.appnexus.com/en/company/platform-privacy-policy#choices" target="_blank">

    <h3>3.	Facebook Pixel</h3>

    <p>
        On grounds of our legitimate interests in and for these purposes of analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our Services, our services use the so-called “Facebook pixel” by the Facebook social network, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA or, if you are an EU resident, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Facebook pixel is a code snippet placed on our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Facebook Pixel allows Facebook to identify the visitors of our online content as a target group for displaying advertisement (known as “Facebook ads”). Accordingly, we use Facebook Pixel to display our posted Facebook ads only to Facebook users who have shown an interest in our services or who share certain factors (such as interests in certain topics or products determined on the basis of visited web pages), which we transmit to Facebook (which is known as Custom Audiences). Facebook Pixel also helps us understand the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes, by showing whether users have been redirected to our services after clicking on a Facebook ad (known as conversion, and allowing to determine on which devices a user is performing an action), in order to create so-called lookalike audiences or statistical twins (i.e. to broadcast ads to target groups that are similar to existing customers) and to obtain comprehensive statistics about the use of the website. Facebook Pixel establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers when you visit our website. This way, the Facebook server is notified that you have visited our website and Facebook assigns this information to your personal Facebook user account. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and therefore offers a guarantee of compliance with European data protection laws:

    <h2 id="section15">XV.	Rights of the data subject</h2>
    <p>
       If your personal data are processed, you are a data subject as defined by the GDPR, and you have the following rights before the controller:
    </p><p>
    </p><h3>1.	Right to information</h3>
    <p>
        You can request the controller to provide you with a confirmation of whether personal data concerning you are being processed by us. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If such processing should exist, you can demand that the controller provide you with the following information:
    </p>
    <ol class="brackets">
        <li>the purposes toward which your personal data are being processed;</li>
        <li>The categories of personal data which are being processed;</li>
        <li>The recipients and/or the categories of recipients to whom the affected personal data has been- or continues to be disclosed;</li>
        <li>The planned storage duration of your personal data or, if specific information cannot be provided, criteria for determining the storage duration;</li>
        <li>the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing; </li>
        <li>the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; </li>
        <li>where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available infor-mation as to their source; </li>
        <li>the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Arti-cle 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such pro-cessing for the data subject.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You shall be entitled to demand information as to whether the personal data concerning you are being transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. In this regard, you can demand to be briefed on the applicable guarantees pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR associated to said transfer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We shall respond to inquiries within a month upon receipt of the request.
    </p>
    <h3>2.	Right to rectification </h3>
    <p>
        You also have the right to rectification and/or completion before the controller, provided that the processed personal data concerning you are incorrect or incomplete. The controller shall have the obligation to implement the rectification immediately.
    </p>
    <h3>3.	Right to restriction of processing</h3>
    <p>
        Under the following circumstances, you may claim the restriction of the processing of the personal data concerning you:
    </p>   
    <ol class="brackets">
        <li>if the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period ena-bling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;</li>
        <li>if the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal data, request-ing that their use be restricted instead;</li>
        <li>if the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of its processing, but you require it for the assertion, exercise, or defence of legal claims; or</li>
        <li>if you have filed an objection to the processing pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, and it has not been yet determined whether the controller’s stated grounds outweigh yours.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If processing has been restricted, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed either with your consent; for the purposes of asserting, exercising, or defending legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the processing restriction was imposed under any of the above circumstances, you will be briefed by the controller before the restriction is lifted. 
    </p>

    <h3>4.	Right to erasure</h3>
    <p>
        You shall have the possibility to erase your account yourself at: 
        <a href="https://goodbye.innogames.com/login" target="_blank">https://goodbye.innogames.com/login</a>.
        We will then erase all your personal data, provided that we are not legally mandated to storing them. After one year of inactivity, we will also erase your account with us.
    </p>

    <h4>a)	Obligation to erase</h4>

    <p>
        You have the right to claim that the controller erase all personal data concerning you without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:
    </p>
    <ol class="brackets">
        <li>the personal data concerning you are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;</li>
        <li>you have revoked your consent on the basis of which the data collection was ground-ed, Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR, and no other legal grounds exist for their processing. </li>
        <li>you file an objection to the processing, pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, and there are no outweighing grounds for the processing, or you file an objection to the processing pur-suant to Art. 21(2) GDPR.</li>
        <li>the personal data concerning you have been unlawfully processed; </li>
        <li>the personal data concerning you have to be erased to comply with a legal obligation which requires processing under the laws of the European Union or the Member States, to which the processor is subject; </li>
        <li>the personal data concerning you have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) GDPR.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>b)	Information for third parties</h4>
    <p>
        If the controller has made public the personal data concerning you and is obliged, pursuant to Art. 17(1) GDPR, to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers who are processing the personal data that you, as data subject, have requested the erasure by said controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, this personal data. 
    </p>

    <h4>c)	Exceptions</h4>

    <p>
        The right to erasure shall not apply whenever the processing is required for the purposes of:
    </p>
    <ol class="brackets">
        <li>exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>
        <li>complying with a legal obligation which requires processing under the laws of the European Union or the Member States, to which the processor is subject, or performing a task in the public interest or in exercise of public authority vested in the processor;</li>
        <li>reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with Art. 9(2)(h) and (i), as well as Art. 9(3) GDPR;</li>
        <li>archival, scientific, or historiographical research purposes serving the public interest pursuant to Art. 89(1) GDPR, provided that the deletion right described in paragraph (a) does not render impossible or impede the realisation of the objectives of the processing;</li>
        <li>for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>5.	Right to briefing</h3>

    <p>
        If you assert the right to rectification, erasure, or restriction of processing before the controller, the latter has the obligation to notify all recipients to whom the personal data concerning you were disclosed of this data rectification, erasure, or the restriction of its processing, unless this should prove impossible or associated with a disproportionate cost. 
    </p>
    <p>
       You have the right to be informed of these recipients by the controller. 
    </p>

    <h3>6.	Right to data portability</h3>
    <p>
        You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you which you have provided to the controller in a structured, accessible, and machine-readable format. Furthermore, you have the right to transfer this data to another controller without restriction from the controller to whom the personal data had been provided, provided that
    </p>
    <ol class="brackets">
        <li>the processing is grounded on consent pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR, or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, and</li>
        <li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        In exercising this right, you have the further right to request that the personal data concerning you be directly transferred by one controller to another, provided that this is technically feasible. The liberties and rights of other persons may not be compromised by these actions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The right of data portability shall not apply to processing personal data which is required for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in exercise of public authority vested in the controller
    </p>

    <p>
       You have the right to object to personal data processing concerning you on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time, on the basis of Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims.
    </p>
    <p>
        If personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, you shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for said marketing purposes, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

    <p>
        If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, personal data concerning you shall no longer be processed for such purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
       In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, you may exercise your right to object by using automated means which use technical specifications.
    </p>

    <h3>8.	Right of withdrawal of consent under data protection law</h3>

    <p>
        You have the right to withdraw your declaration of consent under data protection law at any time. Withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of data processing based on consent effective prior to its withdrawal. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>9.	Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</h3>
    <p>
        You shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly affects you in a significant manner. The above shall not apply if the decision 
    </p>
    <ol class="brackets">
        <li>is required for entering into, or performance of, a contract between yourself and a data controller,</li>
        <li>is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or</li>
        <li>is made with your express consent.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9, Para. 1 GDPR, unless Article 9, Para. 2, lit. (a) or (g) applies and suitable measures are in place to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the cases referred to in points (1) and (3), the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, entailing, at a minimum, the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.
     </p>

    <h3>10.	Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority</h3>

    <p>
        Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that personal data processing relating to you infringes the GDPR. 
    </p>
