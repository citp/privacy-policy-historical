# The Horse: TheHorse.com Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting **TheHorse.com**. As a guest to our site, your privacy is important to us. Following are our online information practices and the way your information is collected and used at this site. 

**Information Collection and Use**

On **TheHorse.com** , you may enter contests, vote in surveys, submit demographic information, subscribe to services, and express opinions. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected via one or more of these vehicles include name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, demographic information, and information about your interests and behaviors. 

**TheHorse.com** may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of operating system you are using (e.g., WindowsXP, Macintosh OS), the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape), and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, MSN). 

**TheHorse.com** members may receive occasional updates about new features and special offers from TheHorse.com, its affiliates, and selected partners. 

**TheHorse.com** and its parent company, Blood-Horse Publications, are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent your e-mail address to other parties in any way other than what is disclosed in this privacy statement. 

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**

This site may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the privacy notices of these other sites as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 

This site may contain advertising, forms, and other data collection methods that directly generate information for sponsors. Data collected by other parties will be identified by the sponsors' name and/or logo. This site has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information. 

This site may offer contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with identified third parties. By virtue of their sponsorship, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. This site has no control over the third-party sponsors' use of this information. 

**Cookies**

To enhance your experience on **TheHorse.com** , many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at **TheHorse.com**. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. 

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to **TheHorse.com** ), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on **TheHorse.com**. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services. 

**Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

We may use outside vendors to ship or fulfill orders placed on our site and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Other Uses of Information**

Information collected on **TheHorse.com** may be shared with other sites owned by Blood-Horse Publications. These sites include [www.bloodhorse.com](http://www.bloodhorse.com/), [www.exclusivelyequine.com](http://www.exclusivelyequine.com/), [www.thoroughbredlegends.com](http://www.thoroughbredlegends.com/), and [www.eclipsepress.com](http://www.eclipsepress.com/). In addition, information collected on our website may be used for other purposes by our parent company such as direct mail efforts. The brand names commonly used in such efforts include _The Blood-Horse, The Horse, TBH MarketWatch,_ Exclusively Equine, Eclipse Press, and _Thoroughbred Legends._

**Security**

This site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to being unlocked (or open) when you are just 'surfing'. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. In addition, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, in a locked cage. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an e-mail to [kbrown@thehorse.com](mailto:kbrown@thehorse.com?subject=TheHorse.com%20Privacy%20Policy). 

**Supplementation of Information**

In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it may be necessary to supplement the information collected from this site with other information owned by this site's parent company or third-party information. In order for this website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners. 

**Correcting and Updating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. 

**Notification of Changes to This Policy**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a notification of such change on our home page. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users of such intentions via e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, please send an e-mail to [admin@TheHorse.com](mailto:admin@%3CB%3ETheHorse.com%3C/b%3E?subject=%3CB%3ETheHorse.com%3C/b%3E%20Privacy%20Policy).
