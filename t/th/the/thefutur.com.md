  * We will disclose information to third parties with your prior consent.



### Deleting of Information

You may ask us to delete some or all of the information you shared with us, provided, however, that we are not required to maintain that information as part of any commercial transaction or contract entered into between us.  For example, we may need to maintain records of credit card transactions or products or services purchased by you from us for a period of time in the event any dispute or other occasion arises whereby that information may be required by third-parties or government entities.

You may request that we delete information provided by you to us by visiting the “Opt-Out/Delete” link at the bottom of our Website or by going directly to [www.thefutur.com/optout](https://www.thefutur.com/optout) .

If you believe that we have inaccurate or incomplete information about you, you may request an update to your information through the Opt-Out/Delete link at the bottom of our Website or by going directly to [www.thefutur.com/optout](https://www.thefutur.com/optout) .

You may request that we limit the use of your information to only that information required for us to conduct any transactions in which you engage with us.  For example, you may request that we discontinue sending e-mails or newsletters to you about upcoming courses or other information regarding our products and services.  You may opt-out from these communications through the Opt-Out/Delete link at the bottom of our Website or by going directly to [www.thefutur.com/optout](https://www.thefutur.com/optout) as well as following the instructions on the communications themselves.

Unless you request that we delete information provided by you, we will maintain that information for a reasonable period of time in the event that you choose, in the future, to purchase our products or services.  For example, you may complete one of our courses, and not find an additional course to be of interest to you at present; however, we may introduce a course in the future in which you may wish to enroll.  By maintaining your information, we make the enrollment process easier, as well as allowing us to provide a history to you of courses in which you previously enrolled.

To maintain the integrity of our Website and the information you provide to us, we may copy that information to a secondary information storage device (AKA back-up).  In the event that you request that we delete your information, we will also delete it from our back-up data storage to the extent that it is commercially reasonable to do so.  Nevertheless, we do not access our back-up storage except under circumstances where data from our primary storage has been compromised (such as may occur during power surges or other situations where our primary storage may be damaged).
