# Privacy Policy | The School of Life

"The School of Life" is the trading name of Campus London LLP which is a UK registered company.  

This privacy policy explains how we will use any personal information which we collect about you when you use this website or correspond with us.

As a company processing your personal data, we are regulated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This page is intended to keep you informed about what we do with the personal data we process. ‘Personal data’, for the purposes of the GDPR, means any information from which you can be identified; it includes things like your name, date of birth, e-mail address, delivery address, billing address, telephone number and IP address.

First of all, we’d like to assure you that we are committed to protecting the privacy of all our users. We will endeavour to ensure that the information you provide us with is kept secure and managed within the General Data Protection Regulations.

If you are not happy with any aspect of how we collect and use your data, please let us know so we can try and resolve it for you. Should this not be resolved, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues ([www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk/)).

It is important that the information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. Please let us know if your personal information changes by emailing us at [classsroom@theschooloflife.com](mailto:classroom@theschooloflife.com) or by editing your information in the ‘my account’ section of our website.

#### 1.   What information we will collect about you

We collect information about you when you register with us or place an order for products or services. We also collect information when you complete surveys, provide feedback or supply us with information during the course of our relationship. Website usage information is collected using cookies.

We may process certain types of personal data about you as follows:

  *  **Identity Data** may include your first name, last name, username, title, date of birth and gender.
  * **Contact Data** may include your billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.

If we link the Aggregated Data with your personal data so that you can be identified from it, then it is treated as personal data.

Depending on the purpose, we may require your explicit consent for processing sensitive data, if so we will send you a further communication asking for you to confirm your consent to this processing.

Where we are required to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of the contract between us and you, if you do not provide us with that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract (for example, to provide services to you).

#### 4.  Disclosures of Your Personal Information

We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above:

  * Third parties who provide fulfillment, marketing and customer support services, such as warehouses and logistics companies, review platforms, email marketing services, marketing automation platforms, social media platforms and Google Ad services (for example, for display advertising and retargeting), and membership service providers.
  * Therapists and course leaders.

  * HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom and other relevant jurisdictions who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
  * Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.



We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

We will not share your details with any other third parties unless we have your explicit consent.

However, if we reasonably believe that we are required by law to disclose your personal information to a third party, whether in compliance with any applicable law or regulation or by court order or in connection with legal proceedings, we may do so. We may also use aggregate anonymised data and share it with third parties.

Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.

If we collect information about you from outside the European Union we may transfer that data into a country which is a Member State of the European Union.

Some of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or
  * Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.



If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.

Please email us at info@theschooloflife.com [](https://www.theschooloflife.com/about-us/privacy-policy/#co_anchor_a599551_1)if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

However, please note that purchasing a ticket for an event outside the European Union, or purchasing goods to be sent to an address outside of the European Union, may require us to transfer your data to third parties outside the European Union, for example to the event venue, for the purpose of fulfilling our obligations under the contract, and you consent to this where purchasing goods or services in the above circumstances.

#### 5\. Data Retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).
