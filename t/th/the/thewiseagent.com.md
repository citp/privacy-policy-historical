###### HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We have implemented measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All Personal Information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

After a transaction, your Personal Information (credit cards, billing address, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.

The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of Personal Information via the internet is not completely secure.
