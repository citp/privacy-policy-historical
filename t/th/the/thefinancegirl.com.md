We may share personal information with the following third parties:

  * Anyone that you request or authorize us to share your information with;
  * Third-party service providers (i.e. credit card processing services, order fulfilment, analytics, event/campaign management, website management, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, auditing, and other similar service providers) in order for those service providers to perform business functions on behalf of the Company;
