## IP addresses and cookies

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.

### **What are cookies?  
**

Cookies are small text files placed on to your computer by the websites you visit. They help improve your experience and allow website-owners to analyse visits.

This is how cookies work: When you first visit a site that uses cookies, a simple text file is downloaded on to your computer, which is then read each time you return to that site. The file, or cookie, can be used to remember usernames, passwords and preferences, for instance, or to personalise searches that you have conducted in the past. All of this information allows you a smoother experience on site. Cookies also help website-owners make improvements by collecting information such as the number and length of visits and pages viewed.

### Retargeting services

We use retargeting services on behalf of education institutions partners to show you advertising that you may be interested in, based on your interactions on our sites. When you are visiting other websites, such as a news service, you may see one of these ads.

Retargeting works by analysing the areas you look at online – such as course subjects or university locations – and creating targeted online advertising campaigns on behalf of our advertising clients. The content of the adverts will specifically support your educational journey, with a particular focus on the types of subjects and institutions which you have previously viewed on our websites.

Cookies and Smart Pixel technologies support our retargeting services which are delivered via partners such as Admedo, Adroll, Facebook and Instagram.

### How can cookies be managed/blocked?

You can set your device to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at all. If you choose not to receive cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the website's features and we may not be able to personalise your experience on site. Each internet browser is different, so check the ‘Help’ menu of your browser to find out how to change your cookie preferences.
