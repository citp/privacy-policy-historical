# Privacy Policy | The PMA

**_Last Updated: June 1, 2018_**

The Performance Marketing Association, Inc. (“we”, “us” or “PMA”) has created this privacy policy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering, use and dissemination practices solely for the web site located at www.thepma.org and any other site or service on which a link to this policy appears (the “Site”). 

**INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

**Personal Information:**

Your provision of your Personal Information to us is completely voluntary. “Personal Information” is information that specifically identifies you as an individual.  We do not collect Personal Information unless you submit that information to us, such as when you choose to sign up for our newsletters or join the PMA. Categories of Personal Information we collect include:

  * Identity Data, which includes name or other similar identifiers.
  * Contact Data, which includes address, email address and telephone numbers.
  * Financial Data, which includes payment card details.



In addition to Identity Data and Contact Data, certain other types of data may be considered Personal Information in certain jurisdictions, namely, the European Union (“EU”), such as:

  * Technical Data, which includes internet protocol (IP) address, location data, your login data.
  * Profile Data, which ** ** includes ** ** your username and password, your interests, and preferences.
  * Usage Data, which includes information about how you use our web site and services.
  * Marketing and Communications Data, which ** ** includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us



Membership payments are processed through Stripe.  Therefore, we do not retain your payment card details, but rather pass them along to Stripe who will process the payments and use your details pursuant to their published policies at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. 

**Non-Personal Information:**

In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-Personal Information”).  We may aggregate Personal Information so that the aggregated information does not personally identify you or anyone else, such as by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our customers who live in a particular area (“Aggregate Information”).  Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may collect, use and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose.  In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information.  If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information.

**INFORMATION USAGE AND DISCLOSURE**

We will only use Personal Information as described herein, as agreed by you or disclosed to you at the time of collection or as otherwise permitted by applicable law:

  * We use your Personal Information to process your membership.
  * We use your Personal Information to contact you about our services (including newsletters, events, and more).
  * We use your Personal Information to respond to your inquiries.
  * We may also share your information with third parties such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, infrastructure provision, information technology services, customer service, e-mail delivery services, credit card processing and other similar services.  These third parties may have access to Personal Information necessary to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.  
  * We may share information about a company, but not the individual persons associated with that company, with any number of third parties, however, we may share the name of a company representative when discussing our members.
  * We will not sell your Personal Information to any third party not affiliated with the PMA without your consent except in connection with the sale or merger of the PMA or the division responsible for such services.  
  * Additionally, we may disclose Personal Information as we believe necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. 



We may use Aggregate Information to improve and enhance your experience on the Site and for our market research activities. For example, we may share Aggregate Information with unaffiliated third parties, such as business partners, industry members or regulators, in an aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the shared information will not contain nor be linked to any Personal Information. 

**Legal Basis:**

We will only use your Personal Information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Information in the following circumstances:

  * Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.
  * Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
  * Where you have given consent.
  * Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.



To the extent permitted under applicable laws, we will also process, transfer, disclose and preserve Personal Information when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary. 

Please note that if you specifically consent to additional uses of your Personal Information, we may use your Personal Information in a manner consistent with that consent. Finally, we reserve the right to supplement your Personal Information with information we gather from other sources which may include information we gather from online and offline sources.
