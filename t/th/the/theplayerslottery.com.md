TPL undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it has collected about individual Players and will not knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside TPL, other than to the Player or as described in this Privacy Policy. TPL has made a substantial investment in its servers, databases, backup, firewall and encryption technologies to protect the information collected by TPL.

Further, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose your Player identification, name, street address, city, state, post code, country, phone number, e-mail, and company to third party agents of TPL as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, money laundering, intellectual property infringement, piracy or other unlawful activity or activity that may expose us to legal liability.
