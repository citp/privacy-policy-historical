# The Scientist - Privacy Statement

The Scientist, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to the privacy of our web site visitors. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for www.the-scientist.com.

## Why do I need to fill out a registration form?

The Scientist asks its Web site visitors to complete a registration form with contact information and some demographic information. This gives us statistics about usage of the Web site, which allows us to maintain the sponsorship that makes it possible for us to provide the Web site free. 

## Why must I enter my e-mail address to access the Web site?

We use your e-mail address for two purposes. First, we want to avoid your having to remember another set of user names and passwords. An e-mail address is simple and unique, and most people remember their own easily. Hence we use the e-mail address as a unique identifier for access to the Web site, and for access to your personal information. Second, if you want to receive our contents alert service, we need your e-mail address. Of course, if you want to maintain complete privacy and do not want to receive our contents alert, you can enter anything you like in the form xxx@yyy.zzz (provided that you can remember it!) 

## Is my personal information made available to others?

The personal information you provide about yourself on the registration form is used for statistical purposes only. 

  


Only if you have given us specific permission may your e-mail address be rented to qualified manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services that we believe will be of interest to you. 

If you want to ensure total privacy, make sure that you uncheck the box that gives us permission to include your address in mailings by third parties. 

## Does The Scientist track which pages I visit on the Web site

Like all Web sites, we keep a log of all page visits by our users. However, this data is analyzed statistically, and individual reading habits are not collected or analyzed. 

## Why does The Scientist Web site require that I accept cookies?

We use cookies for the convenience of our readers. Our Web site places a simple cookie containing no personal information on your machine. This allows you free access to all the articles on our Web site without your having to re-enter your identifying e-mail address.

For further information about cookies and how to protect your privacy on the web go to our [Cookie Information Page](https://web.archive.org/web/20011211121435id_/http%3A//www.the-scientist.com/fixcookies.htm)

## Who has access to my data?

The personal information you provide is accessible to a very restricted group of employees of The Scientist and our web hosting service providers. Strict security measures are in place to ensure that the data is not accessible to third parties, and that it is protected from loss, misuse, or alteration.

## How can I alter or delete my information?

To delete your record from our database, please e-mail your name and e-mail address to [deleteme@the-scientist.com](mailto:deleteme@the-scientist.com)
