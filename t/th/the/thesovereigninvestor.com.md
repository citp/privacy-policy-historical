**PRIVACY POLICY – IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ**  
We at  _Banyan Hill_  take your privacy very seriously.

When you subscribe to one of our products via email, your email address is placed in a database and used to send your issues and occasional alerts. We will not sell, rent, or otherwise share your email address with anyone. You can remove your address from our free email lists by following the instructions at the end of every email we send.

**Personal Information**

We will never ask you for personal information like your credit card number, except when you place an order. At that time, we will provide a secure (SSL, encrypted) connection and require you to submit only the information needed to complete and fulfill your order. Only authorized employees will have access to this information. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone, nor share it in any other way, unless required to by a law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to acquire it. Please note that “personal information” does not include your mailing address. See Mailing Address, below. If your inquiry is about an order or subscription, our customer service staff will ask you to verify your identity by confirming information already in your record.

When you give us your mailing address, we will use this information to fulfill your order or subscription and to send you information on other products that may suit your interests. If you don’t want us to send you this other information, please contact our customer service department:
