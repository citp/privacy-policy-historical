The Education Center is committed to honoring your privacy and improving your online experience. When you register for our site, you provide us with information, such as your name, email address, and interests. We ask for this in connection with registrations, promotions, and purchases so that we can tell you about upcoming features and products that you might be interested in.

When you registered with us, you also let us know your preference in receiving email from us, as well as other companies that offer services for teachers. We honor your preferences and you may alter them at anytime by updating your information at our site. 

In an effort to improve your online experience, we use a software technology called "cookies." This cookie is for log-in purposes only. It is not used to collect any personal information. When you log in for the first time, it leaves bits of information on your computer so that you will be automatically logged in on return visits. However, you will need to enter your user name and password whenever you access your personal information.

Rest assured that any information we store for you, whether at registration or with the cookie, will be treated with the same respect that you've come to know from your friends at The MAILBOX®.
