Information collected

The Works Retail Ltd is the sole owner of information collected. 

The system collects the details provided by you on registration, together with information we learn about you from your use of our service and your visits to our web site and other sites accessible from there. We also collect information about the transactions you undertake, including details of payment cards used. 

We may collect additional information in connection with your participation in any promotions, competitions or surveys offered by us and information you provide when giving us feedback or completing profile forms. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site use, which enables us to improve the service we provide. 

Use of your information and your preferences

We will use your information to provide and personalise our services. We will also use your contact details to communicate with you. We may use your information to send you offers and news about us and our products. We  do not share personal information with third parties, except for the purposes of credit/debit card authorisation and delivery. We may contact you by post, email, telephone or fax for these purposes. 

As soon as you become a registered site user, you will be provided with the option to receive commercial communications from us, please tick the box if you would like to receive commercial communications. 

We like to hear your views to help us improve our service. From time-to-time we may contact you by post, email, telephone and fax to ask your opinions. Again, if you do not want to be contacted for this purpose, please make your choice where indicated. 

Please note, there may be instances where it may be necessary for us to communicate with you, in any event, for administrative or operational reasons relating to our service. 

Disclosures of your information

Your information may be passed to and used by other companies within the group. We will  never pass your personal data to anyone else, except for any successor's in title to our business and suppliers that process data on our behalf. We may also use and disclose information in aggregate 

(so that no individual customers are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes. 

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, wherein we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a Court Order or legal process served on our web site.

Cookies

'Cookies' are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser.
