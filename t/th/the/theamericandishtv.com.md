Like most website operators, The American Dish TV collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The American Dish TV's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how The American Dish TV's visitors use its website. From time to time, The American Dish TV may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

The American Dish TV also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on theamericandishtv.com blogs/sites.
