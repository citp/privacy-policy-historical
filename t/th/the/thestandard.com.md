Privacy Policy

Principles

  * _The Industry Standard_ will not release your personal data to anyone else without your consent. 
  * _The Industry Standard_ does not monitor individual traffic patterns on our site — only aggregate reader behavior is collected.
  * You may change the status of whether you wish to receive Industry Standard offers and communications at anytime. 



Gathering of Information

  * Optional Registration

TheStandard.com offers free, voluntary registration to users. By registering, users can enter the site without having to log on each time; users who register will have complete access to all content and resources on the site; and users who register receive the best available subscription offer at our website. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password and email address, and must answer mandatory survey questions about age, gender, income, Internet connection, zip code, country, employment status, and other employment information.

  * Electronic Newsletters 

_The Industry Standard_ offers several electronic newsletters to users. _The Industry Standard_ gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the instructions provided in every newsletter or by unsubscribing in the [My Account](https://web.archive.org/account/newsletters/1,1758,,00.html) area of our website (requires registration). Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration. 



  * "Mail this Story to a Friend" 

_The Industry Standard_ Article Mailer service allows a reader to electronically forward a news story to someone else by clicking the appropriate link at the top of that story. The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the story. The information is not used for any other purpose. 



  * Surveys 

Occasionally _The Industry Standard_ conducts user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party. 



  * Cookies 

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited and to allow easy access to restricted areas of the website. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. _The Industry Standard_ uses cookies to simplify access to restricted areas and to track user traffic in aggregate. 

If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use TheStandard.com 




Use of the Information

_The Industry Standard_ uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. 

As stated above, _The Industry Standard_ uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to move seamlessly through the website. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. 

We use tracking information to determine which areas our site users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. _The Industry Standard_ does not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

_The Industry Standard_ creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because _The Industry Standard_ doesn't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. 

_The Industry Standard_ does allow select advertisers to mail promotions to registrants and newsletter recipients who have given us their permission to do so. All promotions are pre-approved by _The Industry Standard_ and all mailings are conducted by a reputable third party mail house to ensure the names are not mis-used or used more than once. Our users are asked at the time when their information is collected if they would prefer to not receive promotions from our partners. You may change this designation at anytime. 

Maintenance Policy

_The Industry Standard_ gives users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include: 

  * Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters when registering.
  * Opting not to receive correspondence from carefully chosen third-party advertisers.
  * Opting not to provide certain personal information when registering or when participating in surveys.
  * Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need for any information from our users.



_The Industry Standard_ offers users the ability to correct or change the information collected during registration for any site (see above).  Users may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems or who have any questions about how our services work can contact us at [richm@thestandard.com](mailto:richm@thestandard.com).

Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at anytime by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter. 

Currently, _The Industry Standard_ does not offer users a means by which to completely delete personal information established at the time of registration for any site.
