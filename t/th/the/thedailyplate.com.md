**The Daily Plate Privacy Policy**

The Daily Plate believes that strong personal privacy is a necessity for the success of our business. 

Although we track the total number of visitors to each of our pages in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site, personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only domain names, but not E-mail addresses (where possible). We collect only the domain name, but not the E-mail address of visitors to our Web page, aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, user-specific information on what pages users access or visit and information volunteered by the user, such as survey information and/or site registrations. 

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page, to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual user, to notify users about updates to our Web site, and by us to contact users for marketing purposes. It is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. 

The Daily Plate will respond to visitors who send us E-mail to particular addresses, for example, regarding advertising, partnering, or employment opportunities. The Daily Plate will use the information submitted in those e-mails only to respond to the purpose specified by the sender. 

Except for information we provide to our authorized agents, or as required by law, The Daily Plate does not sell or release any personally identifiable information gathered on our website to any third parties. All personally identifiable information gathered here will be used only by The Daily Plate for internal marketing analysis and to improve our products, services and websites. 

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence of a new privacy policy. This policy is specific to this site.
