marketers have demonstrated their commitment to protecting consumer privacy.
As interactive media evolve, The DMA and its membership renew their commitment
to offer notice and opt-out in this new medium.

with your exact name and address and we will be sure your name is removed
from our marketing list and/or the list we share with other organizations.
</p><p>Persons who supply The DMA with their telephone numbers on-line may
receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they
have placed on-line, new products and services or upcoming events. They
may also receive periodic telemarketing calls from other carefully screened
business-to-business marketers.
