This data is collected using small graphics embedded in the newsletter (so-called pixels), which can also collect Technical Data regarding the device you use. The data is collected exclusively pseudonymised and is not linked to your other personal data. The legal basis for this is our aforementioned legitimate interest, Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. f GDPR [The legal basis of the processing is your consent pursuant to Art. 6 sec. 1 lit. a GDPR]. Through our newsletter we want to share content that is as relevant as possible for our customers and better understand what readers are actually interested in.

The data on the interaction with our newsletters is stored pseudonymously for 30 days and subsequently made completely anonymous.
