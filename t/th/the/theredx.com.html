I just got a new PC and have worked with the support teams from the retailer, computer company, software supplier, and my local ISP.  Needless to say, they weren't very helpful.  However, when I called RedX, your support team was extremely helpful, professional, and answered all my questions!  You should be proud that you have such a great team.
