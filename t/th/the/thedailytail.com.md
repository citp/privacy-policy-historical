Generally we collect personal information from Attendees directly or from our business partners such as new home builders, warranty providers, or industry regulators. This information could be collected in person, over the telephone, through the mail, or by electronic means, under the assumption that the builder, warranty provider or industry regulator has obtained the Attendees consent for us to obtain their customer’s personal information and conduct research on behalf of that organization. We only collect, use, or disclose personal information for the purposes we believe the Customers and Attendees would consider appropriate under the circumstances. Both Customer and Attendee’s knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information unless permitted or required by law. Of course, subject to reasonable and lawful limits, any Customer or Attendee can chose not to provide us with some or all personal information. However this choice may prevent us from providing the product, service or information that has been requested.

CustomerInsight may also use comments provided in survey responses on www.homeownermark.com for builder profiles, however only first names and community name may be used, unless the Attendee has chosen to remain confidential in which case “Confidential” will appear instead of the first name.

CustomerInsight uses credit card information solely to check the financial qualifications and collect payment from prospective Customers and Attendees.
