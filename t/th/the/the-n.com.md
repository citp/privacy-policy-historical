# The N: Privacy Policy/Your California Privacy Rights

**Privacy Policy/Your California Privacy Rights**

The-n.com is a site where people can come to play games, answer polls, and have their opinions heard. It’s also the spot to find out more about the shows on The N, and about the stuff that happens in those shows.

At the-n.com, your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personally identifiable information we collect at our site. This privacy notice applies only to personally identifiable information collected at www.the-n.com and does not cover, unless otherwise specifically stated, any information collected by any other Web site or offline.

**Information Collection**

To fulfill your requests for information, enable you to participate in our site offerings, and to provide you with opportunities to learn about other products and services in which we think you might be interested, we ask that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information during the registration process. To become a registered user you must be at least thirteen (13) years old. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at this site include: name, address, e-mail address, phone number, credit card or other payment information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.

_Non-personally identifiable information_  
We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our Web pages, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, FireFox), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online or Earthlink).

**Use of Collected Information**

We use your personally identifiable information to provide the information or content you have requested (e.g., newsletters, show updates, entering you into a contest, sweepstakes or promotion, registration for our message boards), to contact you about programs, products, features or services in which we believe you may be interested, or for other purposes disclosed at the time of collection. We also may use your personally identifiable information to contact you regarding your use of our Web site or changes to our privacy notice, Terms of Use, or other policies or terms that affect you and your use of our Web site. In addition, we may use information collected about our users to improve the content and navigation of our Web site, or for other internal purposes.

From time to time, we may combine the information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties.

Agents and contractors of the-n.com who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.

In addition, with your permission, we may share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties to enable them to provide you with opportunities to learn of products or services in which you may be interested.

We may disclose anonymous, aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes. For example, we may disclose how many individuals visited certain areas of our Web site, or demographic information about our users. In addition, we may disclose personally identifiable information collected about you at this site in the following instances: 

  * _Legal Action:_ We may disclose information about our users, including personally identifiable information, when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Web site and applicable laws, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web site. We also may disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability; to protect or defend our rights or property; or protect the safety, rights, or property of our users.
  * _Corporate Change:_ We may sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose user information, including personally identifiable information, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets, or other corporate change respecting the Web site.

The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities. In addition, when you post a message on our message boards, you have the ability to post a message that may include personally identifiable information about yourself. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. If you choose to submit content for publication we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to us. 

**Your Choices**

As noted above, we may use the personally identifiable information we collect from you online to provide you with opportunities to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you.

With your permission, we also may, from time to time, share personally identifiable information with unrelated third parties whose practices are not covered by this notice to enable them to provide you with additional opportunities to learn about products or services in which we believe you may be interested. If you would like to request that we not share your information with these third parties, please log back into your profile using your user name and password and edit your preferences accordingly.

**Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors**

Some of our Web pages contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

We may sometimes offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We have no control over these third parties’ use of this information. We will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.

We use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at our Web pages. Our privacy notice does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you.
