# Disclaimer / Privacy Policy - Wonder Forest

Everything you see on Wonder Forest was created by me unless otherwise stated. 

Wonder Forest contains some affiliate links. This means if you click on an affiliate link through to a retailer and purchase something, I may receive a very small amount or percentage of your purchase. This does not add any additional cost to you, the consumer. Adding affiliate links into a post occurs after a review/opinion on the product has already been formed.

This blog accepts paid advertising to help keep it running, as well as complimentary products for review. All complimentary products have been exclusively chosen by myself and will always be disclosed as “c/o” in the post. I never review products that I wouldn’t personally wear/buy/like and am not influenced by compensation. The views and opinions shared on this blog that have been written by me are entirely my own.
