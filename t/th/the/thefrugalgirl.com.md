# Privacy Policy - The Frugal Girl

**Affiliate Disclosure**

Sometimes I include affiliate links in my posts here on The Frugal Girl.

What are affiliate links?

These are links that take you to other sites which offer me some form of compensation for sending them visitors or customers (for instance, if you click on a coupons.com link in one of my posts and print out a coupon from their site, I get a small kickback from coupons.com. I also am affiliated with Swagbucks, Amazon.com, Groupon, and Capital One 360.).

The kickback I receive comes at no extra cost to you, and this income helps to pay for blogging costs (such as hosting and my email subscription service), and for the time I spend running and maintaining this blog.

Though I appreciate making some money in exchange for the time I spend working here, this blog chiefly exists to serve its readers, and for that reason, I will not use an affiliate link for a company I don’t wholeheartedly support.

If I don’t love a product or a company, I won’t try to convince you to love it, and I will not advertise for that product/company. You are more important than money, and my integrity is too.

**_Sponsored Posts_**

Companies sometimes pay me to blog about/review their products or services. Sponsored posts are always clearly labeled and I am very choosy about which sponsored post opportunities I accept. I want this site’s content, including the sponsored posts, to serve you.

**_Press_**  
Whenever my blog and I appear in the press, whether it be in the newspaper, on TV, or on a website, please keep in mind that my appearance does not function as an endorsement of said newspaper, TV, or website (for instance, if I were on Oprah, it wouldn’t mean that I was in agreement with Oprah on all things. Not that Oprah would ever ask me…I’m just using that as an example).

**_Disclaimer_**  
All information provided on this site is for informational purposes only. TheFrugalGirl.com makes no representations as to the accuracy, completeness, suitability or validity of any information on this site and will not be liable for any errors or omissions in this information or any damages arising from its display or use.

ANONYMOUS DATA

From time to time, we may use anonymous data, which does not identify you alone, or when combined with data from other parties. This type of anonymous data may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Examples of this anonymous data may include analytics or information collected from cookies.

COOKIES

The Website uses cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, customize Website content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. Cookies may also be used by third-party services, such as Google Analytics, as described herein.

Users may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies, by the Website, by using a corresponding setting of your internet browser and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. However, if users deactivate the setting of cookies in your Internet browser, not all functions of our Website may be entirely usable.

ADVERTISING

**Display Ads**

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use cookies, as noted above.

**Retargeting  Ads**

From time to time, the Website may engage in remarketing efforts with third-party companies, such as Google, Facebook, or Instagram, in order to market the Website. These companies use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Website.

**Affiliate Program Participation**

The Website may engage in affiliate marketing, which is done by embedding tracking links into the Website. If you click on a link for an affiliate partnership, a cookie will be placed on your browser to track any sales for purposes of commissions.

On the Website, you may subscribe to our newsletter, which may be used for advertising purposes. All newsletters sent may contain tracking pixels.
