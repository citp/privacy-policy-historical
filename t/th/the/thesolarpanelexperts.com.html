<p>Children are not eligible to use our services. You must be at least 18 years old to use this website and we ask that minors under the age of 18 do not submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information about visitors under 18 years of age.</p>
<p class="secondary">Information We Collect:</p>
<p>There are several areas on our website where you may be asked to enter both personal and non-personal information. Our website uses these input forms for clients and potential clients to request information about our products and services. We may also collect information in order to notify you about products, services, and other opportunities we think will be of interest to you.

Clear .gifs work like cookies – they are graphics with a unique identifier which allow TheSolarPanelExperts.com to track the online movement of visitors to our site. No personally identifiable information is tied to a clear gif. Clear gifs are also used in connection with our HTML-based emails to allow us to know when an email has been opened. If you do not wish to receive such email communications, please refer to the Opt Out policy below.</p>
