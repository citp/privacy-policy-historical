        <p>We are SS Digital Media, LLC, a Pennsylvania Limited Liability Company. To do this, we (and some of our advertising partners) ask for data about you and also create data about your use of Themer. This policy tells you what we do with that data. If you want to jump to a particular section of the policy – click on one of the links below:
        </p>
        <p>
        If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us via email at apps@mycolorscreen.com .</p>

        <p>
          </p><ol>
            <li><h4>What data do we collect and how?</h4></li>
            <br>
            <span>We will sometimes ask you for personal data (such as your name, telephone number and date of birth) when you create a Themer registration or when you click to participate in certain activities. We also automatically receive and track certain data about your mobile device (such as your device-type and language preference) and we may create a unique device ID for you so we can recognize you. In some cases we can automatically detect your location data. If you connect with Facebook, Google, or another social network via the Themer app, we may also receive some data from that network (e.g. your Facebook ID, name, profile picture, gender, age, locale and email address).</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><h4>How do we use your personal data?</h4></li>
            <br>
            <span>
            We may use your personal data for the following purposes:</span>
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>to provide you with service offers and the display of customized content, and targeted advertising both on our apps/websites and on other apps/websites that we advertise through,</li>
              <li>to communicate with the Themer products and services and customer service issues,</li>
              <li> to determine when you link from our app to one of our partner apps, so that we can monitor the level of traffic that we generate for our partner apps,</li>
              <li>to ensure the technical functioning of our products and services,</li>
              <li>to protect Themer’s copyright,</li>
              <li>to enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use,</li>
              <li>to comply with laws, requests from a government bodies or courts, or to respond to litigation, and</li>
              <li>to enable us to use a third party to perform surveys measuring your experiences and use of our services.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <span>We may also encrypt and/or aggregate your data with other users' data in order to create statistics about the general use of the Themer apps and websites, which helps us to develop new products and services. We may also share this aggregated data with our business partners and third party advertisers.</span>
            <br><br>
            <li><h4>Sharing data with third parties – key facts and how to opt-out</h4></li>
            <br>
            <span>Third parties (such as companies who advertise through our apps) may require you to provide your personal data in order to access their products, adverts and offers. If you visit or register for a third party product, advert or offer, we may pass some data about your device to that third party (e.g. your tag history and country of registration) so that they can send you offers. However, we won't pass your email address or other contact details to these sorts of third parties without your permission.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span>Any third parties’ use of your personal data is governed by their own privacy policy (which should be accessible from their website or application). If you do not want third parties to be able to access or use your personal data, you should not register for, click on or use the applicable third party application or product.</span>
            <h5>Sharing with social networks</h5>
            <span>If you connect your Themer account to Facebook or Google+ certain personal data will be shared with other users of these social networks.

            <span>We take our responsibilities to the online community very seriously. As such, if you are under the age of 13 we have to ask you not to use our apps or websites in any way. We don't knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 13 and we do not direct any of our products or services at this age group. If we become aware that we have inadvertently captured any personal data about a person who is under 13 years of age, then we will take the appropriate steps to shut down the account of that person.</span>

            <li><h4>How to access and correct your data (and a special note to Californian residents)</h4></li>
            <span>You can update your personal data through the Themer apps and you can ask us about what data we are holding by sending us an email. We will do our best to respond to your request (upon verification of your identity) within a reasonable period of time. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 also permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we disclosed their personal data (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the categories of data disclosed to those third parties. To make any sort of access request, please email or write to us using the details above.</span>

          <br>
          <h4>Registration and Password</h4>
          <p>Access to some of the Themer Website services require that you register with the Website. When you register on the Website, we will automatically create a public profile for you.

          <p>We may prompt you to change your username or deactivate your account, temporarily or permanently, if we believe that in using the name you are attempting to impersonate another person, or that it infringes or may infringe a trademark, breaches any law, is vulgar, offensive or is otherwise inappropriate.</p>
