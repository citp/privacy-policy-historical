The Tracktor collects anonymous data from the use of our product. This information may be used by third parties for targeted advertising purposes. We use "Google Analytics" to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, user demographic and interests, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site.

We and the third parties we authorize may receive and store certain types of non-personally identifiable information whenever you interact with us by using “cookies,” “web beacons” and analogous technology. “Cookies” are small files that are placed on your computer or your internet browser memory to enable the owner of the cookie to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features to you. It is important to note that the cookies that we use, or permit others to use, do not contain and are not tied to personally-identifiable information about you.

Please note, however, if you set such browser settings or delete existing cookies then some elements of our website may not function properly or be available to you. 

##### Preference Based Advertising

We also work with and permit certain third parties, including, but not limited to advertising networks and website analysis firms, to place cookies on your computer or browser when you view, click or otherwise interact with advertisements that are featured on our website. These third party cookies and analogous technology are used to gather non-personally identifiable information about your activities on our website and third party sites you may visit to serve you with advertisements that are relevant to your interests and preferences while you are on third party sites. Some of these third parties participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”), an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across different web sites.
