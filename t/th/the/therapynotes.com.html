            <p>
                At TherapyNotes, we are committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your personal information. This Privacy Policy 
                explains the use of information collected via our Website and in connection with our provision of services to you (the "Service"). 
                Your use of the Service indicates to us that you have read and accept our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>
                    This privacy policy agreement does not pertain to protected health information entered by registered users.

                    defines the privacy of patient information for registered members of our practice management services.
                </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                As further described below, we collect and maintain a range of data in order to provide our services to you and maintain a 
                safe and secure Service.  Access to your personal information is limited to (a) TherapyNotes employees, and (b) service 
                providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as to provide or help TherapyNotes provide products or 
                services to you, provide payment, billing or similar services, or perform anti-fraud functions). As used in this Privacy Policy, 
                the term "personal information" means any real world information that readily may be used to identify an individual, including 
                but not limited to a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information.

                customer service. We request some information directly from you during registration. We gather other pieces of data indirectly 
                from Website traffic, your computer hardware and Internet connection, or your activities within the Service, communications and usage.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    If you notify us of an intellectual property claim, the information in your claim notice may be shared with others.

                <li>
                    If you cease being a customer of ours, we will keep a copy of your registration file in our database for use in the 
                    event you wish to rejoin the Service, and for anti-fraud and other purposes.
                </li>

            <h2>TherapyNotes' Protection and Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

            <p>
                Except under certain limited circumstances set forth here and in our Terms of Service, TherapyNotes does not disclose to 
                third parties the personal information or other account-related information you provide us, such as IP address, without 
                your permission. You understand, however, that TherapyNotes may disclose your personal or other account-related information 
                under the following circumstances:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary under applicable law, or to comply with legal process 
                    served on TherapyNotes;
                </li>
                <li>
                    In order to protect and defend the rights or interests of TherapyNotes or Users of the Service;
                </li>
                <li>
                    In order to report to law enforcement authorities, or assist in their investigation of, suspected illegal or wrongful 
                    activity, or to report any instance in which we believe a person may be in danger;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To service providers with whom we have contracted to assist us with Service features or operations (such as anti-fraud 
                    functions, billing, collections, registration, customer support, email delivery, or age verification), to fulfill your 
                    service requests, offer new content or help us improve our Service. Our contracts with these third parties prohibit them 
                    from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service they are providing;
                </li>
                <li>
                    To other third parties (a) to provide you with services you have requested, (b) to offer you information about our 
                    Service (e.g., events or features), or (c) to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are 
                    otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service). For instance, we may provide certain information 
                    to our payment processor, to credit card associations, banks or issuers (if you are using a credit card); and
                </li>
                <li>
                    To other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a combination 
                    occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. 
                    If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

            <p>
                A cookie is a small string of data which often includes an anonymous unique identifier sent to your browser from a website's 
                computers, and stored on your computer's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's 
                preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already 
                sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is 
                different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) However, if you reject all 
                cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our (or other companies') web pages.
            </p>

            <p>
                TherapyNotes and third parties acting on our behalf use cookies for a number of purposes relating to the Website including to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Access your account information when you "log in" to our Website, forums, or other areas;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep track of your Website session data; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep track of certain information that is then aggregated (i.e., not connected to your personal information), such as how 
                    you use our Website, what web pages you visit, and the frequency and length of those visits.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third Party Advertisements</h2>

            <p>
                TherapyNotes participates in ad and/or affiliate networks operated by various third party companies. These companies collect and 
                may use certain anonymous information about your visits to our Websites as a function of referring Internet traffic to our Website. 
                We do not permit these companies to collect any personal information about you, such as your name, address, or email address; 
                however, we do permit these companies to collect your IP address. These companies may set and use cookies, web beacons, pixels, 
                or other technologies to collect anonymous information about your visits to our Websites, and may otherwise aggregate, analyze 
                and anonymize that data.
            </p>

            <h2>Amendment of this Policy</h2>

            <p>
                We may need to update our Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in the types of information we collect, the means we use 
                to collect information, or our usage of collected information. We will make reasonable efforts to alert you to these changes when 
                they occur. Changes take effect immediately upon posting to our Website.
            </p>

            <h1>DMCA POLICY</h1>

            <p>
                TherapyNotes will respond to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). 
                The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notification to an online service provider concerning alleged 
                copyright infringement. When a valid DMCA notification is received, the service provider responds under this process by taking 
                down the offending content. On taking down content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the 
                removed content so that a counter-notification may be filed. On receiving a valid counter-notification, we generally restore 
                the content in question, unless we receive notice from the notification provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a 
                court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity.
            </p>

            <h2>Filing a Notification</h2>

            <p>
                A written notification must be made. This can be done either by fax or written letter (regular mail or courier). Emails will 
                not be accepted unless a prior arrangement has been made. The notification must:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed upon (i.e., describe the work that you own).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identify the item that you claim is infringing on your copyright.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide a reasonably sufficient method of contacting you; phone number and email address would be preferred.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include the following statement: "I have good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above and 
                    contained on the service is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or by protection of law."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate 
                    and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sign the paper. 
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                Please note: The DMCA provides that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys fees) if you falsely claim that 
                an item is infringing your copyrights. We recommend contacting an attorney if you are unsure whether an object is protected by 
                copyright laws.
