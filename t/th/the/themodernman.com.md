**Privacy Policy**

Hi mate

It’s Dan here, with a few words on **your privacy** while using this site and any Modern Man products and services. 

Working on this area of your life is a very personal journey. 

When I was working on getting the area of ‘women and dating’ handled, it certainly was a private journey also. 

I didn’t want **anyone** to find out!

So, at The Modern Man – we understand your position and will endevour to maintain your privacy from our end.

Here are some FAQs on privacy: 

**

Will I ever receive anything in the mail with The Modern Man on it?

**

No. 

You won’t ever receive anything to your postal address with The Modern Man written on it, so you won’t have to worry about anyone finding out.
