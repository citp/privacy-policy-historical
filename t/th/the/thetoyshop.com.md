## Legitimate interest

As the new data protection law (GDPR) comes into force on 25th May 2018 there are a number of lawful reasons for us to use (or 'process') your personal information. One of the lawful reasons is called 'legitimate interests'. Broadly speaking Legitimate Interests means that we can process your personal information if: 

  * We have a genuine and legitimate reason _and_ we are not harming any of your rights and interests.



Some typical examples of when we might use the approach are for preventing fraud, digital marketing, maintaining the security of our system, data analytics and enhancing, modifying or improving our services.

As ever, you can opt-out at any time.

## Other websites

Our website and marketing communications may contain links to other websites run by carefully selected partners. We’ll make it clear you’re visiting a partner website before you click.

We don’t run these websites so we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting them. Please look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question before supplying any personal details.

## Cookies

Our website uses cookies to collect information. A cookie is a piece of text which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, your browser adds that text in a small file.

Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
