                    RealMatch and

                    are aware of the sensitive nature of employment information and is committed to
                    providing its users with high standards of online security and privacy protection.
                    The following Privacy Statement presents our online data collection and usage policies
                    and practices. This site is powered by a service and technology provided by RealMatch,

                    Collection and Use of Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Registration on this site is voluntary, and is designed for the purpose of seeking
                    employment. Upon registration the site collects your email address and other personal
                    information (such as employment skills) in a "profile." The site collects personal
                    and demographic information you choose to provide us. We also collect information
                    about how you use our site and the areas of our site that you visit. In your profile,
                    you are NOT required to include your name or contact information. Your email address
                    is required, however, so that you may be contacted for employment opportunities,
                    or in case we need to contact you regarding site changes or information about your
                    account. When you apply for a position, however, you need to provide your name and
                    full contact information; this information is shared only with the employer to whom
                    you applied. However, if you maintain a resume as part of your profile, the information
                    in this resume may be viewed by employers other than those to whom you have specifically
                    applied. In order to provide you with the broadest exposure to potential employment
                    opportunities, information you place in your profile may be shared with RealMatch
                    affiliated companies or within other sites powered by RealMatch. Neither RealMatch
                    nor its affiliates distributes personal information for advertising purposes.

                <p>
                    RealMatch attempts to limit access to the searchable resume database only to potential
                    employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals.
                    However, WE DO NOT AND CAN NOT guarantee that other parties (including parties disguised
                    as employers) will not gain access to this database. Therefore, RealMatch and
                    TheJobNetwork
                    hereby specifically exclude any responsibility and or liability related to the use
                    made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable
