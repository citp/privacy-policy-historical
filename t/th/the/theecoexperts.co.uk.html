<h3>ABOUT OUR SITE</h3>
<p>Our site enables people to find and participate in online surveys and other earning opportunities.</p>

<p>The service that our site provides is to connect people with providers of online surveys (e.g. market research companies) and other earning opportunities(<b>“Service Providers”</b>).</p>

<h3>HOW OUR SITE WORKS</h3>
<p>If you’d like to participate in online surveys and other earning opportunities (<b>“Offers”</b>), please complete and submit our sign-up process (webform).  You will be asked to select (by ticking boxes) the specific Offers that you would like to participate in.</p>

<p>Once you have completed the webform, you will receive a confirmation email for each Offer that you expressly selected.  The email will come from us, or from the Service Provider that you expressly selected, and it will ask you to confirm your choice by clicking on a link.  If you still wish to participate in the Offer, then simply click on the link, which will take you through to the Service Provider’s website.</p>

<p>You will also receive a general welcome email from us.</p>

<p>As our service is all about finding and telling people about Offers, we will also email you about other, similar Offers from time to time, unless you opt out of receiving such emails.  At any time, you can unsubscribe from such emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link in an email.</p>

<p>We don’t work with any Service Providers until we have a legal contract in place. This is to ensure that they keep your data secure and confidential.</p>
	
<h3>ABOUT US</h3>	
<p>The Eco Experts is a brand of Marketing VF Limited (<b>“MVF”, “we”, “us”, “our”</b>) is a company registered in England and Wales (company number: 06951544), whose registered office address is at Imperial Works, Perren Street, London NW5 3ED, United Kingdom.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (the <b>“GDPR”</b>), Marketing VF Limited is the controller in relation to your data. We are registered as a controller with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) under registration number Z1995728. You can confirm our registration here: <a href="https://ico.org.uk">www.ico.org.uk</a></p> 

<h3>WHAT WE DON’T DO WITH YOUR DATA</h3>
<p>Before confirming what data we collect, and why, here’s what we definitely <u>don’t do</u> with your data, unless clearly set out in this notice:
</p><li>We don’t share it with anyone else.</li>
<li>We don’t use it for any purpose (including retargeting, commingling across multiple advertisers’ campaigns or allowing piggybacking or redirecting with tags), except on an aggregate and anonymous basis, and only to assess the performance and effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</li>
<li>We don't use it to build, append to, edit, influence or augment user profiles, including profiles associated with any mobile device identifier or other unique identifiers that identify any particular user, browser, computer or device.</li>
<li>We don’t transfer it (including any anonymous, aggregate or derived data) to any advertising network, advert exchange, data broker, or other advertising or monetisation-related service.</li>
<p></p>


<h3>WHAT DATA WE COLLECT, AND HOW</h3>
<p>If you complete our webform (as described above), it will ask you for your contact details and other information, such as your name, email address, telephone number, postal address, postal code, gender and/or date of birth.</p>

<p>From time to time, we change our webforms, and so they may ask you for other information. It will always be clear from the webform what information we’re requesting, and we only request information that is relevant to your request, and the service that we’re providing.</p>

<p>We also store and share Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, as explained below. Every computer or device has an IP address – a unique number – which enables it to communicate with other computers and devices over the Internet. </p>

<p>We may monitor and/or record these calls for the purposes of quality control and staff training. Also, occasionally, we may need to provide Service Providers with limited access to such recordings in order to resolve disputes.</p>

<p>Additionally, we might collect data about you if you:
</p><li>Contact us, or we contact you, by email, telephone or post.</li> 
<li>Post comments, material or other content on our site.</li><p>


</p><h3>HOW WE USE YOUR DATA</h3>

<p>We use your data (described above) in the following ways.</p>

<h4>To enable you to participate in the Offers that you have expressly selected</h4>

<p>As explained above, if you submit our webform, you will receive a confirmation email for each Offer that you expressly selected.  The email will come from us, or from the Service Provider that you expressly selected, and it will ask you to confirm your choice by clicking on a link.</p>

<p>We will also pass your contact details and other information (as described above) to each Service Provider that you expressly selected to enable them to email you regarding the Offer and confirm your choice. </p>

<p>We store IP addresses in order to stop unwanted traffic (i.e. spam) to our site.  For example, if we become aware that spam is coming from a particular IP address (i.e. computer or location), we can block that IP address.  From time to time, we also share IP addresses with Service Providers to enable them to verify the country in which people who sign up to our service are based.</p>

<h4>To email you about Other Offers – <u>But only if you haven’t opted out of such emails</u></h4>

<p>If you use our service for finding and participating in Offers, then, as an existing user, we would like to email you about similar Offers (<b>“Other Offers”</b>).</p>

<p>You will always be given an opportunity to opt out of such messages before we send them, and we will not send such messages if you have opted out.</p> 

<h4>To create custom and lookalike/similar audiences</h4>

<p>We like to work with Facebook, Google and other platforms (<b>“Platforms”</b>) to reach out to you with adverts for Other Offers. We also like to use Platforms to reach out to other people who might like to use our quote request service.</p>

<p>We do this in two ways. In both cases, your data, along with other data, is used to create a custom audience and/or a lookalike/similar audience. Whenever an audience is shared with a Platform, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised, meaning that any data within the audience that could identify a person is replaced with an artificial identifier. So, the process is secure. Also, we don’t share more data than we need to for the purpose of creating the audience.</p>

<li><b>Custom audience</b> – A custom audience is a list of existing users of our service (<b>“Existing Users”</b>). From time to time, we share this with Platforms. As explained above, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised. The Platform uses this audience to show our Existing Users our adverts for Other Offers.</li>
<li><b>Lookalike/similar audience</b> – A lookalike/similar audience is an audience created by the Platform. From time to time, we share with Platforms a list of Existing Users. The Platform uses this list to find and create lookalikes – i.e. other Platform users who have similar characteristics to the Existing Users – to which it shows our adverts. Again, as explained above, the data is first hashed and pseudonymised.</li>

<p>As we explain below, at any time, you may object to such activity by emailing us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@mvfglobal.com">dataprotection@mvfglobal.com</a>.</p>

<h4>Receiving data from Service Providers</h4>

<p>From time to time, Service Providers may return data to us, together with confirmation on whether or not you and other subscribers have started or completed any surveys.  They do this in order to enable us to improve our marketing.  We may also use such data to create custom and lookalike/similar audiences, as explained above.</p>

<h4>Working with suppliers</h4>

<p>We work with a number of suppliers, who process data on our behalf. These include cloud storage providers and email service providers. We have appropriate contracts in place with such suppliers to ensure the protection and confidentiality of data.</p>

<h3>COOKIES</h3>

<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. At the bottom of this policy, we have included a table, setting out what cookies we use, and the purposes for which we use them.</p>

<p>Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">www.aboutcookies.org</a> or <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p>To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites visit <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>

<h3>TRANSFERRING YOUR DATA</h3>

<p>We may transfer your data outside the European Economic Area (the <b>“EEA”</b>).</p>

<p>Some of those countries (e.g. Canada, New Zealand, USA) have a European Commission adequacy decision, which means they are considered to offer an adequate level of data protection.</p> 

<p>Other countries do not have the same level of legal protection as countries in the EEA, or with an adequacy decision. If we do transfer your data in this way, we will take steps to ensure that it is protected to the same levels that apply in the EEA. This may include, for example, ensuring that the organisation receiving the data is registered with the EU-US Privacy Shield (in the case of transfers to the USA), or that we use the EU’s model contract clauses.</p>

<h3>STORING YOUR DATA</h3>

<p>We have a data retention policy, which clearly sets out how long we keep data for, and for what reasons.</p>

<p>We will keep your data only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose/s for which it was collected in the first place, i.e. as set out in this notice.</p>

<p>For example:  If you haven’t opted out of receiving Other Offers from us, we will keep your details, and send you emails, until such time as you don’t engage with our emails for a period of 6 consecutive months. Following that period, we will not use the data, save that we will hash/anonymise the same, and retain it for a further 3 years for compliance purposes.</p>

<h3>LEGAL GROUNDS</h3>

<p>This notice sets out (above) how we use your data. Under the GDPR, controllers must have a valid lawful basis for each processing activity that they undertake. This section sets out our lawful basis for each activity.</p>
