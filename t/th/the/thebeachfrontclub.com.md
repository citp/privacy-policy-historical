# Privacy Policies of The Beachfront Club -

### 1\. we respect our members' privacy 

The BFC will never sell or give away your private contacts or information to third parties for the purpose of spamming, advertising or commercial benefit of any kind.

We also limit the information that the BFC sends to its members in an attempt to give you only those things that interest you and that you want. That includes sending you nothing, if thats preferred. Please read our full Privacy Policies.

### 2\. minimal log-in information

Visitors may access virtually all sectors of the BFC website without registering or providing any information about themselves. However, if a user wishes to participate in any on-line activity, upload content, book a hotel or access one of the few restricted zones he/she must register first. Registering requires minimal personal information: name and e-mail contact only. This is a critical need for the security of our site - it is not because we need information about you.

### 3\. your information, your choice

In addition to the two, minimum log-in data fields required for registration as above, the BFC collects information about you that you choose to provide and place in your profile. This information is kept within our site for our clearly stated purposes only: to help create a global network of true beachfront hotels and a community of beach-lovers who will then communicate and cooperate in various ways for the benefit and preservation of beach environments. 

### 4\. no advertising whatsoever

The Beachfront Club does not favour on-line advertising in any form. The Club website does not carry banner or other advertising on its website, save the simple promotions of member hotels and the special offers they wish to promote. We will never send advertising to the e-mail contacts we collect nor will we ever give, rent or sell those e-mail contacts to any third party engaged in advertising or spamming.

### 5\. Information from other sources

In some cases we might obtain information about you from other sources. For example, if you arrive on our site through an associated website (like Facebook), a social networking or similar website where you have registered, your profile information might also be sent to us. We treat all such information in the same manner as the information that you provide to us directly.

### 6\. Information about others

In some locations within the website you might have opportunity to provide the BFC with contact information about your family, friends or others. Please obtain the consent of other parties before sending their contact or personal information to us. 

### 7\. confidential sharing of information only 

The information we collect about members through our log-in and profile functions, or from other sources, will be kept in a secure and confidential manner. The only other parties permitted access to any part of this information will be those performing a function necessary for the operation of this website, such as a provider of newsletter distribution services engaged by the BFC. In such cases the third party will be forbidden to disclose the BFC's member contacts and information or utilize these for any other purpose.

The only other parties that may be given access to personal information are websites or businesses within, or associated with, The Beachfront Club group. 

### 8\. personal profiles

Those people who are eager to share information about themselves in order to make contact with like-minded members of the BFC and the global beach community will find our growing use of personal profiles helpful. We will introduce more extensive profiles as our community grows, along with secure privacy settings that will allow those who use this service to control who does and does not see their profile information. Smart profiles will help people to meet others who share their interests, to forge bonds, to meet new friends on new beaches and to join beach- and environment-related activities worldwide.

### 9\. newsletters & bulletins

Our newsletters, bulletins and promotions are restricted to our own BFC on-line publications dealing with topics directly related to the concerns of the BFC. These are the only e-mails you will receive from us. However, every user has the choice to opt-out of or opt-in for our on-line publications, or select a range of suitable publications at any time by using the settings within 'Newsletter' under 'Community' in the Global Navigation Bar. This range includes selections of newsletters by topic, geographic location and other criteria.

### 10\. e-mails and mail lists 

Our policy is to make contact with companies and individuals that can benefit from our website services and will thus be pleased to learn about the site. We wish to avoid becoming part of the growing problem of unwanted, annoying spam. 

E-mails introducing The Beachfront Club website and services are sent to e-mail addresses of companies and individuals that we have gathered through serious research and who we believe can gain advantage from the BFC services. These include hotels that we have mapped, travel-related businesses including travel agents, tour operators, travel writers and travel newsletters. We seek individual photographers, writers, reviewers and bloggers who have an interest in beaches and who we believe will be interested in posting to the BFC website. We send only such targeted e-mails that result from our own research and never purchase mail lists from third parties.

All of our news bulletins and many e-mails carry an opt-out function allowing people to choose to be permanently removed from our lists.

### 11\. contests & promotions

From time to time the BFC may offer prizes through contests and other promotions. Users who participate in such contests or promotions will not be added to any additional mailing lists without their consent nor be targeted in any way for the sale of other services or products.

### 12\. cookies

Following standard practice for membership websites we may place cookies in your computer to enhance your experience in various ways, including a cookie that recognises you and provides a fast-track log-in. You can delete the cookies at any time, though doing so might make your use of the BFC website slower and less convenient.

### 13\. keep up-to-date on The Beachfront Club's policies

The Beachfront Club reserves the right to make changes to its Privacy Policies or to update them as and when it sees the need. It is your responsibility to check these policies on our website in a timely manner to keep abreast of any changes to clauses that might affect you.
