## 1\. Collection of Information.

###### 1.1 Survey Information.

The Muscle Maximizer collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes a The Muscle Maximizer survey, order form, or a registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, a “Survey”). (As used herein, “online” means using the Internet, including the Websites, and related technologies, and “offline” means by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, The Muscle Maximizer or a third party (a “Third Party”) may ask an individual to provide various information to The Muscle Maximizer , which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, “Survey Information”). The Muscle Maximizer may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to The Muscle Maximizer or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from The Muscle Maximizer or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to The Muscle Maximizer.

###### 1.2 Third Party List Information.

The Muscle Maximizer collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and The Muscle Maximizer subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the “Seller”). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual’s name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, credit card information, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, “Third Party List Information”).

###### 1.3 Other Information.

Other occasions when The Muscle Maximizer obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by The Muscle Maximizer or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through The Muscle Maximizer’s customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a The Muscle Maximizer service or newsletter (together, “Other Information”).

###### 1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.

The Muscle Maximizer currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, The Muscle Maximizer may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, “Technology Information”).

**(a) Cookies.**

A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows The Muscle Maximizer to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in The Muscle Maximizer’s database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.

**(b) Web Beacons.**

A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function — see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows The Muscle Maximizer to track certain web sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, The Muscle Maximizer might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party’s website where fishing products are sold. When Bill, an individual listed in The Muscle Maximizer’s database, visits the fishing website, The Muscle Maximizer receives notice by means of the web beacon that Bill visited the fishing site, and The Muscle Maximizer would then update Bill’s profile with the information that Bill is interested in fishing. The Muscle Maximizer may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Bill. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, The Muscle Maximizer also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in The Muscle Maximizer’s database.

**(c) New Technology.**

The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is The Muscle Maximizer’s use of new and evolving technology. As a result, The Muscle Maximizer strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.

The Muscle Maximizer will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If The Muscle Maximizer obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such information, The Muscle Maximizer has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. The Muscle Maximizer has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

###### 1.8 Credit Card Information.

The Muscle Maximizer may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card (“Credit Card Information”) when an individual places an order from The Muscle Maximizer. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to The Muscle Maximizer, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
