This Privacy Policy applies to this website and all of the products, services and websites of the properties owned and operated by us and our subsidiaries in the United States, unless otherwise indicated. Where additional detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy notices to describe how personal information is processed.
We value your trust and respect your confidentiality. As a general practice we do not provide any online information, or any information gathered through forms, applications or other means to outside third parties, except as otherwise designated in this policy. We do not sell or rent any information gathered online, or in individual property players’ clubs, to any outside organization. 
This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect about you, when we may disclose such information to third parties, and about your use of the websites and services. We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. 
</em><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong><br>
           We do not collect personally identifiable information about visitors except when visitors specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. Such personally identifiable information may be gathered in registrations, applications, information requests, reservations, rsvps, online purchases, online surveys, and in some instances in the process of utilizing offers from our third party strategic partners and alliances. <br><br>


We may use personally identifiable information for the following general purposes: contacting an account holder regarding account status, changes to the account agreement, special discounts, promotions, products offered and other matters relevant to the service and/or the information collected. Additionally, we may share your information, whether individually or in the aggregate, with our subsidiaries and affiliates, and in certain cases with selected outside third party partners and alliances for marketing or promotional purposes or to improve the products or services offered by us and our subsidiaries and affiliates.<br><br>

We value opinions and comments from our visitors and we may conduct online surveys or issue invitations for such. We also offer an online Guest Comment form. These surveys are entirely optional for all website visitors. Usually the information from such surveys is aggregated and used for improving our products, services and operations and those of our subsidiaries and affiliates. In other cases we will use the identifying information as a vehicle for responding to an individual question or comment. 
<br>
            <br>
            Collection of Aggregated Information 
Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey. We reserve the right to perform statistical analyses of visitors’ behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the website. We may provide aggregated data from these sources to third parties for purposes of research and evaluation. <br>
<br>

<strong>Sharing of Personal Information with Our Third Party Business Partners and Alliances</strong><br>

<br>

When we provide personal information to our third party business partners and alliances, we require them to exercise reasonable care to protect your personal information and restrict the use of your personal information to the purposes for which it was provided to them.

<br>

<strong>Non-Personal Information </strong><br>

Even if you do not provide information to us, we may collect non-personal information about your use of our website, special promotions and other services. <br>
<br>

<strong>Cookies </strong><br>

Non-personal information (for example, domain names or e-mail and IP addresses) and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of our internet servers or at our discretion through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files we can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate a visitor's ongoing access to and use of the website, track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that can allow content and speed of access improvements and targeted offers. We do not link non-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable information without your permission and do not use cookies to collect or store personal information about you. <br>
<br>

Cookies are not programs that download onto a visitor's system and damage files (such as, viruses or worms) or send information to third parties about websites visited (such as, spyware). Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no meaning outside the assigning website. <br>
<br>

If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. However, visitors should note that cookies may be necessary to provide them with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on our websites. <br>
<br>

We may also use other standard Internet technologies, such as flash technologies, web beacons or pixel tags, and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of our websites. For example, we may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information obtained with such technology enables us to customize the services offered and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content, advertising campaigns, and the products and services we offer through the websites.<br>
<br>

<strong>Security </strong><br>

We have in place certain commercially measurable technological and procedural security measures in an attempt to protect and safeguard the security of the personal information provided by our visitors. Strict measures will be taken to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or dissemination of personal information. <br>
