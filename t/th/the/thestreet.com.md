We have recently revised our policy. Please take some time to review the new version below. This Privacy Policy includes examples of the types of personal information we collect and the kinds of companies with whom we share such information. These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a complete inventory of our information collection, use and sharing practices. We will comply with applicable state laws that may restrict the types of information we may disclose about you or require us to provide you with additional notices.

TheStreet.com, Inc. gathers two types of data about users: (a) personal information, which individual users provide (i) when registering as a member of _TheStreet.com_ , our free flagship site, (ii) when registering as a subscriber to one of our premium subscription services, and (iii) voluntarily at certain other points, such as contests or surveys; and (b) tracking information, which is automatically collected about all visitors to our sites. 

**Personal Information**

TheStreet.com collects personal information in several places on our web sites, which are set forth generally below. We will always provide a secure area of our sites for you to enter your information, but if you prefer, you may talk offline to a customer service representative and provide the required information over the telephone or via email. 

  * **Membership**  
Currently, we do not require users to become members of TheStreet.com in order to have access to the free commentary, analysis and news available on our flagship site, _www.thestreet.com_. However, if you'd like to receive one or more of our free email newsletters, gain access select commentary articles from _RealMoney_ and daily archives of Jim Cramer's radio program, or use our _MyStockWatch_ service to filter content from _TheStreet.com_ , we require you to register [here](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?PID=PRFR-0003&OID=000842) to become a member. In order to register, you'll have to supply us with your email and postal addresses, choose a unique User Name and password, and provide us with some additional information about you (the reason for your visit to TheStreet.com, what kind of investor you are, etc.). Additionally, you will be required to verify your email address by clicking on the activation link in the Welcome Letter that will be sent to you upon your submission of a completed registration form. 
  * **Premium Services**  
If you'd like access to one or more of our premium subscription-based services, you first must [register](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?PID=PRFR-0003&OID=000842) as a member of TheStreet.com as described above, and then you'll have to pick a unique User Name and password. Then, on the subscription registration page for the premium service you are interested in, you'll need to supply us with the information specified to activate your free trial or paid subscription.

At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your investment experience or your reactions to a particular article. Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally to better market our services, participation is voluntary. In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers. Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary.

However, entrants may select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names.
