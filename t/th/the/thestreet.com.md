**TheStreet.com, Inc. Privacy Policy**  
**Last revised: November 5, 2001**

TheStreet.com, Inc. shares your concern about the protection of your personal information online. This is our policy regarding the privacy of information we collect on our web sites. We have revised our policy in connection with the introduction of our new commerce platform. Please take some time to review the new version below.  | **Information Gathered and Tracked by TheStreet.com, Inc.**  
---  
  
TheStreet.com, Inc. gathers two types of data about users: (a) personal information, which individual users provide (i) when registering as a member of _TheStreet.com_ , our free flagship site, (ii) when registering as a subscriber to one of our premium subscription services, and (iii) voluntarily at certain other points, such as contests or surveys; and (b) tracking information, which is automatically collected about all visitors to our sites. 

**Personal Information**  
Personal information is gathered in several places on our web sites. We will always provide a secure area of our sites for you to enter your information, but if you prefer, you may talk offline to a customer service representative and provide the required information over the telephone or via email. 

  * **Registration**  
Currently, we do not require users to become members of TheStreet.com in order to have access to our free commentary, analysis and news, but if you'd like to receive one or more of our free email newsletters, we require you to register [here](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/register/freereg_benefits.jsp?action=freereg) to become a member. In order to register, you'll have to pick a unique User Name and password, and supply us with your email address, zip code, and, if you like, a daytime telephone number where we can reach you. 
  * **Premium Services**  
If you'd like access to one or more of our premium subscription-based services, we require you first to [register](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/register/freereg_benefits.jsp?action=freereg) as a member of TheStreet.com. In order to register, you'll have to pick a unique User Name and password, and supply us with your email address, zip code, and, if you like, a daytime telephone number where we can reach you. Then, on the subscription registration page for the premium service you are interested in, you'll need to supply us with the information specified to activate your free trial or paid subscription. 
  * **Real-Time Portfolio Tracker**  
You may, at your option, subscribe to a real-time, streaming Portfolio Tracker, which is provided to us as a result of a partnership with Money.net Inc. Use of the Money.net Real-Time Portfolio Tracker is completely voluntary and is the privacy or your portfolio information is governed by Money.net's [Privacy Policy](http://my.money.net/scripts/wrap?name=privacy&wrap=yes). 
  * **Message Boards and Chats**  
We provide message boards and chats for discussion of various topics. Although any user of TheStreet.com may read messages posted to the boards, only _RealMoney_ subscribers are permitted to post on the boards. Frequently asked questions on the use of the message boards can be found [here](http://www.thestreet.com/talk/library/780279.html#netiquette). No additional personal information is required to post on the boards, but participants are asked in the interests of accountability, honesty and informed dialogue to include their full names in any posting, as well as any positions they have in stocks being discussed. Please note that information you post to a message board or chat will be available for any user of that service to read, and is no longer private. 
  * **Surveys/Polls**  
At certain times, you may be asked to participate in surveys, which are generally aimed at obtaining general information, for example, your investment experience or your reactions to a particular article. Because information obtained in these surveys is connected with individual subscribers and is used internally to better market our services, participation is voluntary. In addition, some columnists will on occasion take polls of their readers. Such polls are solely for the editorial use of the individual columnists, and participation is voluntary. 
  * **Contests and Purchases**  
We sometimes offer contests in which certain personal information is required for registration, for purposes of verifying the entrants' identities and notifying the winners. If the contest is being administered by a third party, this information will be disclosed to that third party. However, entrants select contest names distinct from their User Names, and the information is not connected with their User Names. We also require shipping and billing information in order to fulfill online purchases of tangible items, such as books and videos. 



**Tracking Information**  
Tracking data consists of both individual and aggregated tracking information and is automatically gathered using "cookies". 

  * **What is a "cookie"?**  
A cookie is a small data file containing information, such as a user's login name, that is written to the user's hard drive by a web server and used to track the pages visited. Cookies used by TheStreet.com, Inc. are encoded and contain a unique digital signature to prevent tampering. They do not contain user passwords. The individual information gathered in this manner is used for internal purposes only, such as accessing a member's account information. We also use the information on an aggregate basis, to track the readership of stories and analyze traffic patterns on our site. 

You can control your browser's settings regarding cookies by selecting "Internet Options" or "Preferences" in the menu bar of your browser. This will allow you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, have your browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether. However, because cookies allow you to easily navigate our web sites without having to constantly reenter your User Name and password, we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

  * **Tracking by our Advertisers**  
In addition to cookies placed by TheStreet.com, advertisers and advertising vendors that serve ads onto our web sites may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies or practices of any such advertisers and vendors. The privacy policy of DoubleClick, our primary third-party ad server, can be found [here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&).

The privacy policy of Avenue A, an interactive advertising agency which also serves its clients' advertisements to our sites, can be found [here](http://www.avenueainc.com/privacy/). In addition to its own cookies, Avenue A employs technology that is commonly referred to as "action tags" (also known as "web beacons" or "one pixel .gif files") to measure the effectiveness of its ads on behalf of its clients. Avenue A uses an action tag to set or read its cookie. Any information that Avenue A collects using these cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. Avenue A may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Unless otherwise notified, Avenue A does not use names, addresses, e-mail addresses or telephone numbers, and does not link online actions to an identifiable person. If you would like to opt-out, click [here](http://www.avenuea.com/info/optout.asp), and Avenue A will change your cookie to one that does not contain a unique user ID number, which will prevent Avenue A from collecting any information from your use of the Internet.
