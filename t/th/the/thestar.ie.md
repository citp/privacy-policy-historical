  * Subject to the above, your rights under Data Protection Legislation may include (as relevant):

**Your right** | **What does it mean?** | **How do I execute this right?** | **Conditions to exercise?**  
---|---|---|---  
Right of access | Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to have access to your personal data which we hold (this is more commonly known as submitting a “data subject access request”). | Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email dataprotection@THESTAR.IE and/or by post to ISL Data Controller, ISL, 27-32 Talbot St, Dublin 1, Ireland. If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations. | We must be able to verify your identity. Your request may not affect the rights and freedoms of others, e.g. privacy and confidentiality rights of other individuals and/or businesses.   
Right of data portability | Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled to receive the data which you have provided to us and which is processed by us by automated means, in a commonly-used machine readable format. | Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email dataprotection@thestar.ie and/or by post to ISL Data Controller, ISL, 27-32 Talbot St, Dublin 1, Ireland. If possible, you should specify the type of information you would like to see to ensure that our disclosure is meeting your expectations. | The GDPR does not establish a general right to data portability. This right only applies if the processing is based on your consent or on our contract with you and when the processing is carried out by automated means (e.g. not for paper records). It affects only personal data that was “provided” by you. Therefore, it does not, as a rule, apply to personal data that was created by the ISL or supplied to the ISL by any other individual and/or business.  
Rights in relation to inaccurate personal or incomplete data | You may challenge the accuracy or completeness of personal data which we process about you. If it is found that personal data is inaccurate, you are entitled to have the inaccurate data removed, corrected or completed, as appropriate. | We encourage you to notify us of any changes regarding your personal data as soon as they occur, including changes to your contact details. 

Please always check first whether self-help tools are available.

Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email dataprotection@thestar.ie and/or by post to ISL Data Controller, ISL, 27-32 Talbot St, Dublin 1, Ireland.

Objections must be based on grounds relating to your particular situation. They must not be generic so that we can demonstrate that there are still lawful grounds for us to process your personal data.  
Right to have personal data erased | Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled, on certain grounds, to have your personal data erased (also known as the _“right to be forgotten”_ ), e.g. where you think that the information we are processing is inaccurate, or the processing is unlawful. | Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email [dataprotection@thestar.ie](mailto:dataprotection@thestar.ie) and/or by post to ISL Data Controller, ISL, 27-32 Talbot St, Dublin 1, Ireland. | There are various lawful reasons why we may not be in a position to erase your personal data. This may apply (i) where we have to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) in case of bringing legal proceedings or defending legal proceedings, or (iii) where retention periods apply by law or under the ISL’s internal data retention policies.  
Right to withdrawal | You have the right to withdraw your consent to any processing for which you have previously given that consent. | Requests for such information should be made in writing to to Data Protection Officer by email [dataprotection@thestar.ie](mailto:dataprotection@thestar.ie) and/or by post to ISL Data Controller, ISL, 27-32 Talbot St, Dublin 1, Ireland. | If you withdraw your consent, this will only take effect for the future.
