### 12\. Cookies Policy

**a. What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a “device”) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website or third party service provider used by the website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website or third party service provider to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites or other third party service providers.

Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of THE NEWS TRIBE features. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

**b. How does** **THE NEWS TRIBE **use cookies?****

Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse your profile when you visit and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example: if on a previous visit to gardenersworld.com you requested the weather report for your area, then the next time you visited our cookie could enable us to recognise your machine and offer you the latest weather for your area without you having to re-enter your details.

THE NEWS TRIBE also uses a number of independent measurement, advertising and research companies. They gather information regarding the visitors to THE NEWS TRIBE sites on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. THE NEWS TRIBE uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. THE NEWS TRIBE strictly requires that third parties do not use any of this type of information for their own business or other purposes (see **section 3: Will** **THE NEWS TRIBE **share my personal information with anyone else?**** above). Certain other areas of THE NEWS TRIBE may use cookies for a specific reason – for example, to help an online game work effectively on your device. If this is the case, the local terms for that area of the website will make this clear and you should refer to those local terms for additional information.

**13\. COMMENT POLICY**  
The News Tribe encourages you to add comment to our discussions. You may not post any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic or other material that would violate the law. Please note that THE NEWS TRIBE makes reasonable efforts to review all comments prior to posting and THE NEWS TRIBE may edit comments for clarity or to keep out questionable or off-topic material. All comments should be relevant to the post and remain respectful of other authors. By submitting your comment, you hereby give THE NEWS TRIBE the right, but not the obligation, to post, air, edit, exhibit, telecast, cablecast, webcast, re-use, publish, reproduce, use, license, print, distribute or otherwise use your comment(s) and accompanying personal identifying information via all forms of media now known or hereafter devised, worldwide, in perpetuity.
