# The AnswerBank Privacy Policy in The AnswerBank: Editor's Blog

**The AnswerBank Privacy Policy**

The following provides details about our Privacy Policy. This policy only applies to The AnswerBank website and not to the websites of other companies, individuals or organisations to which we provide links. 

**Why do we need your e-mail address?**

  1. To make sure that all information and responses from the editorial staff reach the right person.
  2. To notify you when someone has answered your question.
  3. To provide you with news and updates concerning The AnswerBank.



**What other personal data does The AnswerBank collect?**

Only the name, username and password you entered when you signed up. This is to protect your privacy and ensure that other people cannot sign on to the site in your name without your permission. The AnswerBank may request further personal information in the future in order to improve our website and services. 

If we are requested by the police or any regulatory or government authority investigating suspected illegal activities, or in response to a UK court order, to access and disclose individually identifiable information concerning your activities whilst using our website, we shall do so (but we will, where reasonably practicable, notify you in advance of any court order). We also reserve the right to disclose individually identifiable information to third parties where a complaint arises concerning your use of our website, and that use is deemed by us inconsistent with this policy. 

The AnswerBank takes privacy very seriously. Please note that the AnswerBank does not share any personal identifiable information to advertisers. We will not sell or give any personal contact information of any kind of AB users who sign up for the 'Paid for your Views' polls. 

**What happens if The AnswerBank gets sold?**

As we continue to develop our business, it is possible that we might sell The AnswerBank or enter into agreements with co-partners, or buy other businesses or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a sale, your personal information may therefore be sold, traded or licensed to third parties (who may be located outside the European Economic Area).
