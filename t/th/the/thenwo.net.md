### **WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?**

The information gathered when you interact with the Empire Herald Services falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your email address and 2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.

_**Personal Information That You Give Us Or Ask a Third Party to Share with Us**_

**Registration Information  
**

Registration for the Empire Herald Services may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique email address and demographic information (ZIP code, age, sex, household income, job industry and job title) to register.

You may register or enhance your profile by linking your Facebook or Google accounts on EmpireHerald.com. By doing this, you are asking them to send us certain information from those social media accounts, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use what they send us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can unlink your social media accounts or control what they share from their privacy controls.

Social media registration features may collect your IP address, the page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our web site.

You can disassociate your EmpireHerald.com registration from third-party accounts any time. For more detail, please see our Social Media FAQ.

**User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments, Reader Reviews)**

We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on EmpireHerald.com and other Empire Herald Services. “Public activities” are any actions you take on EmpireHerald.com that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by Empire Herald for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.

Public activities may be included in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not Empire Herald. Please see our Comments FAQ for additional information.

When you share or recommend links to content on a third-party platform (such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter), that action and any information you share will be covered by their privacy policy.
