## PRIVACY POLICY

### OVERVIEW

The Clymb respects the privacy needs of our valued customers and members. This Privacy Policy outlines what specific information is gathered on TheClymb.com site and how that information is used. The Clymb works to ensure highest degree of protection for consumers and businesses. In fact, our standards meet (and exceed) the U.S. Department of Commerce's "Safe Harbors" standards. We will continue to work to ensure that our website complies with strict standards for online privacy, security, business practices, transaction integrity and availability. If you have any specific questions about the The Clymb's Privacy Statement, please contact us via email at [privacy@TheClymb.com](mailto:privacy@TheClymb.com). 

### COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THECLYMB.COM

The Clymb explicitly asks when we need information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information"). Your personal information is used to create your personal access to products on the site, and to contact you in the course of using the products. Financial information that is collected is used to verify identity, and to bill either you or your company for products. Demographic and profile data collected by The Clymb may be used to tailor the website or any requested email communications, and to display information that is more relevant to you. The Clymb also compiles demographic and product use information, but in the aggregate only. Under no circumstances will The Clymb make any personal information about an individual user available to anyone. Your email address is used to only send you information that you have requested. As part of your use of any The Clymb product, The Clymb allows you to elect to receive, or not receive, certain information from The Clymb. The Clymb adheres strictly to permission-based email policy. The Clymb will not send you unsolicited email information, commercial offers or advertisements. The Clymb will not sell, rent, or loan our contact lists or our customer's contact lists (including customer data) to any outside firms. All emails that you have requested will have an option to unsubscribe. Unsubscribe requests are fulfilled immediately and no further communications will be sent to users who have stated that they do not wish to receive the specified information. While IP addresses (address of a computer) are logged to track a user's session, the user's identity is anonymous. Tracking IP addresses gives The Clymb information about which parts of our site are used most often and what information is viewed. 

### INFORMATION USE BY THIRD PARTIES

It is The Clymb policy to never provide your personal information to third parties without your express permission or only in instances where such disclosure is necessary to process payment transactions or provide services that you have requested. We do not release personal information about you as an individual. The only exception is if The Clymb is compelled to do so by an appropriately empowered governmental authority. The Clymb will not share with them any more information than is necessary to perform the transaction you have requested. The Clymb will not sell, rent, loan or allow external access to a customer's contact lists. 

### CREDIT CARD INFORMATION

The Clymb allows you to purchase merchandise in a variety of ways. When credit card billing is chosen, information is transferred to The Clymb's Clearing House Partner using industry-leading, secure transmission technology including SSL and HTTPS (the transmission standard used for transactions by major financial institutions). The information is then encrypted using Data Encryption and stored securely so that it is ready to handle your transactions. 

### THE BOTTOM LINE

Maintaining the privacy of your information is of paramount importance to us as it helps foster confidence, goodwill and stronger relationships with you, our customers. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free contact us at : [privacy@theclymb.com](mailto:privacy@theclymb.com)
