The following are the types of information we may collect:**

 ** **Information You Provide to Us****  
We may ask you to provide us with information through the Web Site, including the following:

We may combine non-personal information with personal information, in which case we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. 

Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Site’s features.

Note that we may de-identify personal information we have received, turning it into non-personal information.

The code does not identify you directly, but it may be used to connect your activity and interests.
