## Collection of Personal Information

The Gazette Company news website uses your personal information for three general purposes.

We may share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties in limited instances. For example, we may share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties as is necessary to process or collect payments, or service registered-user accounts.

We may also share aggregate, non-personal information about website usage with unaffiliated third parties, including, but not limited to, government agencies, advertisers and the media. This aggregate information does not contain any personal information about our users.

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit The Gazette Company news website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to our website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

## Collection, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personal Information

In some cases, a Gazette Company news site may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable, as described below.

This number does not identify your name, e-mail address or other personal information. If you request pages from any Gazette Company news website, that site's server will enter your IP address into a log.

To maintain user anonymity, The Gazette Company news sites do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. We also do not permit IP addresses to be associated and viewed with posts to chat rooms and bulletin boards. We store IP addresses for a period of time to help us to identify anyone who refuses to comply with our in-house rules or terms of service, and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or others. We also will use this information to measure site traffic for purposes of system administration and for our sponsors. This aggregate data also helps us to understand how people are using the website and helps us improve your online experience.
