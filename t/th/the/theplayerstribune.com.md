This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.

Additionally, if you sign in to the Services or any features of the Services through a Third Party Service, for example, by using Facebook Connect to leave comments on articles on the Services, some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us. By using a Third Party Service in connection with the Services, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Third Party Account Information may be transmitted to us and that such Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy.

All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.

 **IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:  **

  * We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).
  * Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.

 **Information Collected Using Cookies:**

  * Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website.

  * Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your usage of the Services.
  * Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.

 **Aggregate Information:  **We collect statistical information about how users use the Services (“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you or your web browser.

 **Information Regarding Your Social Networks:  **Occasionally, our Services will provide opportunities for users to interact with their accounts on other services, such as Facebook or Twitter (each a “Third Party Account”). For example, you can access posting and sharing tools on the Services, including a “share” or “like” button that allows you to post information to your social networks outside of the Services (“Share”). For example, you can Share articles you like from Players’ Tribune with your Facebook friends or Twitter followers. Please note that these tools may be operated by Third Party Services.

By using these tools, you acknowledge that some Third Party Account Information may be transmitted to us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Additionally, when you use one of these sharing tools, the Third Party Service that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser or online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own privacy policy. Lastly, when you use these tools, some of your information from the Services (such as recent articles you’ve Shared) may be shared with the Third Party Service and others. Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy policies and other policies of social networks or any other Third Party Services you use in connection with the Services.
