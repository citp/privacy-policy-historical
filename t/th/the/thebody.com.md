# The Body: Privacy Policy

| 

###### 

This Web site is a service of The HealthCentral Network, Inc., the corporate parent of Body Health Resources Corporation. HealthCentral respects the privacy of visitors to this Site. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand what information we collect through the Site and what we do with that information. This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected online through the Site and, where specified, through other services within the Network, and does not describe the ways in which we may collect or use information obtained offline or through any other means. 

This privacy policy may change from time to time. Questions or comments regarding it may be directed to [registration@thebody.com](mailto:registration@thebody.com), or in writing to The HealthCentral Network, Inc., 2300 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22201, attention: General Counsel. 

### COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

You do not need to provide any information that identifies you ("Contact Information") to obtain information from The Body. In general, you can visit the site without revealing your identity or any Contact Information. Your decision to provide personal information, including your name, e-mail address, or personal health information, to access special features at The Body is completely voluntary. 

You may choose to provide The Body with Contact Information for the following purposes: 

  * **Information Updates**  
You may opt to give us your e-mail address and join a list of visitors to whom The Body distributes regular updates about new features, information and services (such as new treatment options, forums, conference coverage, or pharmacy or clinical trial services we may offer from time to time). These updates are distributed by e-mail. We do not furnish these e-mail addresses to third parties, unless you explicitly agree; provided however that we may use third party vendors to distribute our e-mails or provide related services. We contractually require any such vendor to keep your e-mail address confidential and not use it for any purpose other than what we have hired them to do. To make our communications personally relevant (unless we state otherwise at the time you furnish the e-mail address), we may associate your e-mail address with other information provided to us by you, previously, concurrently or subsequently. You may unsubscribe from this feature at any time. 
  * **Comments**  
You may write to us with comments about the site. You need not identify yourself to send a comment or question; you may remain anonymous. If you choose to provide Contact Information in your comment or question, we may keep it in our correspondence files and we may send you a response. The Body does not furnish any e-mail addresses received in this manner to third parties, unless you explicitly agree; provided however that we may use third party vendors to distribute our e-mails or provide related services. We contractually require any such vendor to keep your e-mail address confidential and not use it for any purpose other than what we have hired them to do. 
  * **Public Forums**  
You may choose to participate in expert question and answer forums, bulletin boards and chat rooms. You need not disclose Contact Information to participate in these activities. We make no attempt to deduce personal identities from non-personal information such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. In expert question and answer forums, we attempt to eliminate inadvertent disclosures by visitors of potentially identifying information in publicly posted questions, but there can be no assurance that we will delete all Contact Information that may be disclosed. Accordingly, please remember that any information posted publicly in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Contact Information in public. 
  * **Research and Buyers' Club Opportunities**  
If you are at least 18 years of age, you may submit personally identifiable information about your health to The Body for purposes of volunteering for research which may be conducted or arranged by various clinical researchers and laboratories which are independent of The Body, or utilizing discount buying programs which may be hosted by The Body, and involve the services of various companies, such as pharmacies, that are also independent of The Body. Your decision to provide your personal health information, including your HIV-related health information, is completely voluntary. We understand how sensitive this information is. 

Accordingly, before you provide any of your personal health information in an application to participate in clinical trials or buying programs, The Body requires you to read and agree to the terms and conditions of Participation Agreement related to such program and to consent to the release to others of the health information you will be providing, particularly your HIV status. The terms under which this Contact Information is provided are set out in more detail in the Participation Agreement, and we urge you to read it carefully. It also indicates the care we take to store the information you provide in a secure manner, using encryption. Your consent authorizes The Body to provide your Contact Information to the clinical researchers and laboratories involved in the specific trials for which you are volunteering and/or to the independent buyers' club providers described in the Participation Agreement, such as pharmacies. You can change your mind and decide not to disclose your personal health information at any time before you submit the Participation Agreement. Further, if you choose to agree to the Participation Agreement and to disclose your personal health information, at any time, you may request that The Body no longer provide your personal health information to clinical researchers, laboratories, buyers' club providers or other third parties. 

  * **Sponsored Offers**  
Our advertisers and other sponsors may collect information from users of this Site through offer forms that we display on the Site on their behalf. These forms are labeled as advertisements or identify the advertiser or other sponsor that is making the offer and may ask you to provide Contact Information, demographic information, health-related information, and other information. As will be apparent from the Web page on which the form is displayed, we submit the information you provide on such forms directly to the advertiser or other sponsor identified on the form and we retain a copy of such information only for as long as is necessary to establish to the satisfaction of the advertiser or sponsor the value we have provided. 



### COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

  * **Anonymous Surveys**  
You may elect to participate in a visitor survey by filling out an electronic survey form and submitting the results. Unless you explicitly agree, these surveys do not collect any Contact Information -- and when data is collected anonymously it is not associated with your Contact Information. 
  * **Cookies**  
Web sites can gather certain non-personally identifiable information about the usage of their sites through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files that are used to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate ongoing access to some sites, allow sites to understand how and when pages are visited and by how many people, and maintain identities during user sessions. 

Our cookies consist of an alphanumeric identifier that allows us to track the pages you've visited on our Site. We use cookies and other technologies, including digital image files known as web beacons (also referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs), that allow us to track user activity. For example, our servers automatically collect usage information about how you and other visitors interact with our Site, such as the number of visitors to our Site and to pages within our Site, the frequency with which you and other visitors access individual pages within the Site, the time you and other visitors spend on the Site and on pages within the Site, and other similar information ("Usage Data"). We aggregate this Usage Data to understand overall visitor traffic patterns. We use this information to improve our Site by making it more responsive to the needs of our users. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, and to avoid showing you the same ad or other message repeatedly. Our cookies do not collect or contain your personally identifiable information. We do not combine the Usage Data we collect with your personally identifiable information. Usage Data enables us to figure out how often users access parts of the Sites so that we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible, and improve the content. We may share this aggregate information with advertisers and other third parties, but it does not indicate the identity of individual users. Our advertisers and third parties that provide advertising, products and/or services through our site may also assign their own cookies, or place their own web beacons, a process we don't control. 

We do not track your movements on third party sites and we do not have agreements with third-party advertisers or others to use cookies to create user profiles of visitors to The Body. 

The help function on most Web browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be able to take advantage of some of our Sites' most attractive features. Many companies offer programs that help you to visit Web sites anonymously. While we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available. 

  * **Internet Protocol Addresses**  
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. This number does not identify your name, e-mail address or other Contact Information. If you request pages from The Body, The Body's servers enter your IP address into a log. To maintain user anonymity, The Body does not associate IP addresses with records containing Contact Information. We also do not permit IP addresses to be associated and viewed with posts to chat rooms and bulletin boards. The Body stores IP addresses for a period of time to help us to identify anyone who refuses to comply with The Body's in-house rules or terms of service, and to identify visitors who threaten our service, site, customers or others. The Body also uses its log of IP addresses to compile aggregate information on how our visitors are using The Body and to measure site traffic for internal purposes for us and our sponsors. This aggregate data helps us to understand how people are using The Body and helps us improve your experience with The Body. We also use IP address information for systems administration, to report aggregate information to sponsors and advertisers, and to conduct Site analysis. 



### Disclosure of Your Contact Information

The Body takes very seriously its responsibility to keep your Contact Information private. Accordingly, unless you have explicitly agreed otherwise, we do not make any of your personally identifiable information available to third parties, except as set forth below. 

**A. Business Transfers:** As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Contact Information and other information that we have associated with Contact Information may be part of the transferred assets. 

**B. Vendors:** HealthCentral, like many businesses, sometimes contracts with other companies to perform certain business-related functions. For example, we may use third party companies to provide e-mail and direct mail services, database research and maintenance, payment processing, and other services. If you have registered with the Site, we may share your Contact Information and other information that we have associated with your Contact Information, as necessary or desirable for the third party to provide such services for us. Those third parties have contractually committed not to use your Contact Information (and the information we've associated with your Contact Information) for any other purpose. 

**C. Other Disclosures:** We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law or legal process, to enforce our Terms of Use or protect HealthCentral against legal liability, or to protect the rights, property, health, or safety of visitors to our Site, our advertisers, vendors, the public or HealthCentral. 

At the specific request of users who volunteer for research opportunities or buying programs, we may share the Contact Information of those volunteers with participating researchers, laboratories or buyers' club providers administering the programs for which those users have volunteered. We will require by contract that these third parties hold Contact Information in strict confidence, and not use it for any reasons other than the ones for which the volunteer gave permission. These researchers, laboratories and buyers' club providers are independent of The Body, however, and there are limits on the assurance The Body gives you when information passes into their hands. Visitors considering volunteering should read carefully the Participation Agreement discussed under Research Opportunities, above, to understand the limits of our responsibility. 

Except as set forth above, you will be notified before we share your Contact Information (and other information that we have associated with your Contact Information) with third parties, and we will not share such information with third parties without your consent. 

### How We Protect Contact Information

Our goal is to take measures to protect the privacy of any information you choose to provide, that are reasonable in the context of the information provided. Accordingly, The Body uses physical, electronic, managerial, and contractual procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online, and we use encryption and heightened security procedures when storing or transferring data provided to us by visitors seeking to participate in research opportunities. We only keep information for certain periods of time; we delete Contact Information received and general information on bulletin board postings and other public areas of the site when such information is no longer needed or has become outdated in our judgment. 

We also safeguard Contact Information from unauthorized access. Only authorized employees and agents required by contract to observe our privacy practices are permitted to access Contact Information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. Any employee who would violate our privacy access policies would be subject to disciplinary action. 

### External Links

The Body provides links to various Web sites other than our own, and we do not control them. Even if an affiliation exists between The Body and such a third-party Web site, The Body exercises no control over linked sites. When you click on one of these links, you will be transferred out of The Body and connected to the Web site of the organization or company that you selected. Each of these linked sites maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and procedures. If you visit a Web site that is linked to The Body, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any Contact Information. 

### Safeguarding Children's Privacy

It is The Body's policy not to collect Contact Information or any other identifying data from children under 13 years of age. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send Contact Information to us, it is our policy not to use that information except to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that it is our policy not to accept the submission. Certain areas of The Body are dedicated to the important issues of AIDS and HIV among young people and children. These areas of our site present issues that are important to parents, children and health care professionals, but are not directed toward children under the age of 13. In this context, please be mindful of The Body's policy concerning external links, above. 

### My Health Tracker Service

By using the My Health Tracker Service offered by The Body, you agree to be subject to the terms of the Participation Agreement as part of the registration process. The terms of the Participation Agreement shall govern any Contact Information or other information that you submit through the My Health Tracker Service. 

### Terms, Changes and Questions

By using The Body, you signify your agreement to the terms of our privacy policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not disclose any Contact Information through The Body. If we decide to change The Body's privacy policy, we will post those changes here so that you will be aware of what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. 

Questions or comments about this policy or the use of Contact Information may be sent to [registration@thebody.com](mailto:registration@thebody.com). We will use reasonable efforts to promptly investigate any complaint you may have regarding our use of Contact Information.
