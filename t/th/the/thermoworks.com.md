How does ThermoWorks protect your information?

ThermoWorks maintains its data in a secure, password-protected database and employs encryption and other security technologies to protect the transfer of credit card numbers and other personal information. Feel free to contact us for more information about security technologies employed by ThermoWorks.  
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. To guard your information delivered to us electronically, our web sites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your contact information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our web sites, and you do so at your own risk.  
We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. 

What about other websites that ThermoWorks links to?

From time to time, ThermoWorks provides links to other websites as a service or convenience to our customers. Sites that are not owned by ThermoWorks are not governed by this privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy and security policies of any website that you visit.

Are the policies subject to change?

Yes, ThermoWorks reserves the right to change these policies from time to time in order to better serve you but any such changes will always be reflected here.
