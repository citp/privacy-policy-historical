We may collect the following personal information:

  * (If you sign up as a registered user of this website) your username and password, which you will be asked to provide these every time you login.

**Sources of this personal information**

We will collect your personal information from you directly via this website. In addition, we may obtain your personal information and content from other sources such as social media websites.

**What is sensitive personal data?**

Sensitive personal data (also known as ‘special categories of personal data’) is a more sensitive category of personal information which relates to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning (mental or physical) health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

Please do not provide sensitive personal data to us through our website.  With your interests in mind, we do not actively solicit sensitive personal data from users of our website.  Registered users with a beatles.com “My Account” profile should note that if they refer to their hobbies, interests, spare time activities, opinions and beliefs when they talk about themselves on their profile page, this may indicate e.g. their religious beliefs or racial or ethnic origin and this will amount to sensitive personal data.  Users might inadvertently provide this information in “free text” boxes.  You must exercise caution. **Please note – you must not volunteer this kind of information about yourself.**   

The same points apply to criminal convictions and offences data. 

**What do we do with the personal information we collect and what are the legal grounds for our processing of your personal information (including when we share it with others) for these purposes?**

Data protection laws require us to explain what legal grounds justify our processing of your personal information (this includes sharing it with other organisations). For some processing more than one legal ground may be relevant (except where we rely on a consent). Here are the legal grounds that are relevant to us:

    1. To check and enforce compliance with the terms of use on this website;

    2. When we share your personal information with suppliers and distributors.

  3. Processing necessary **to comply with our legal obligations** :

In particular, we may (if you consent by opting in) send information to you which we think may be of interest to you including direct marketing information about products and services from Apple, other members of our Group and carefully selected third parties (see “Direct Marketing” below).




**How and when can you withdraw your consent?**

Much of what we do with your personal information is based on other legal grounds. For processing that is based on your consent, you have the right to take back that consent for future processing at any time. You can do this by contacting us (see below). The consequence is that we cannot send you our newsletter or other marketing communications.

**Will your personal information be transferred outside the UK or the European Economic Area?**

We have explained that we may disclose your personal information to other members of the Apple group of companies and agents or contractors acting for us or them.  

Personal Information may in addition be transferred to other locations outside the EEA for example to our service providers if they or their servers are based there. When your personal information is processed inside the UK and the EEA then it is protected by data protection laws. Some other countries and territories do have adequate protection for personal information by law. We will make sure that suitable safeguards are in place before we transfer your personal information to those countries except in cases where what are called ‘derogations’ apply.

For more information about suitable safeguards and (as relevant) how to obtain a copy of them or to find out where they have been made available you can contact our Data Manager – our contact details are in this privacy notice.

Safeguards can include: (i) the Standard Data Protection Clauses (also known as EU Model Clauses) obtain a copy of them or to find out where they have been made available you can contact our Data Manager using the details below; (ii) the US Privacy Shield and details are available here: <https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome> or you can contact our Data Manager using the details below for more information; or (iii) Binding Corporate Rules provided the recipients in other countries have obtained the requisite approvals and the published list of approvals.

**What if you are using this website from outside the UK?**

We operate this website from within the UK.  We are not subject to your country’s local laws and this privacy notice may not be compliant with those laws (for example, laws related to direct marketing and the use of cookies on websites).  

**Direct marketing (using your personal information)**

If you consent by opting in, we may use your information in order to send you our newsletter and other direct marketing by email about products and services of Apple Corps relating to the Beatles, about all four members of the Beatles taken separately, and about other members of the Apple group of companies and of carefully selected third parties such as Cirque Du Soleil companies, Universal Music companies, MPL (McCartney Productions Limited) and Harrisongs Limited.  This means that we will make it clear on the relevant pages of our website if the personal information we collect (ie name and contact information including email address) may be used for direct marketing purposes and we will ask for your consent on those pages.  

You can choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes, as follows:

In each direct marketing communication we send by electronic means (including our email newsletter) we will remind you of how you can prevent further electronic direct marketing.  You may do this by using the link provided in the marketing email to send an “UNSUBSCRIBE” request.

**Security  **

It is important to bear in mind that the internet is not a secure means of communication.  We cannot guarantee the security of personal information sent to us through this website.

If you sign up as a registered user of this website, you will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password.  You should not disclose it to any other person.  Please notify our Data Manager promptly (contact details above) if you believe your username or password may have been compromised.  We will not be responsible to you if there is unauthorised access to your user account as a result of someone else using your login details after you have compromised them.

We may also monitor users’ behaviour on their beatles.com profile pages. Our monitoring may check for obscene or profane content, threatening or anti-social behaviour, or anything that might compromise the safety, enjoyment or privacy of our users.

**Profiling and other automated decision making**

This section is relevant where we make decisions about you using only technology, and where none of our employees or any other individuals have been involved in the process. For instance, we may do this to decide what marketing communications are suitable for you based on your age, location or music preferences.

We can do this activity based on our legitimate interests (and they are listed in the section about legal grounds above) and this is because this activity does not have a legal or other significant effect on you.

Profiling for direct marketing can mean there is a right to object (see ‘rights to object’ below).

**Retention of your personal information**

In the event that your beatles.com account is terminated by you or by us, we will retain your personal information after that termination only for as long as is reasonably necessary bearing in mind the purpose(s) for which it was collected (see above) or for as long as is necessary in case of any legal challenges or other problems, or as is otherwise permitted or required by law.  After that period your personal information will be suppressed in or deleted from our database(s).

Unless we explain otherwise to you, we will generally hold your personal information in accordance with the following criteria:

  * **Retention in case of queries.** We will retain the personal information that we need to keep in case of queries from you;

  * **Retention in case of claims.** We will retain the personal information that we need to keep for the period in which you might legally bring claims against us; and

  * **Retention in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements.** We will retain the personal information that we need to satisfy our legal and regulatory requirements.

  * **If you unsubscribe from our email marketing service we won’t retain your personal data for that purpose.**




If you would like further information about our data retention practices, contact our Data Manager.

**What are your rights under data protection laws?**

Here is a list of the rights that all individuals have under data protection laws. They do not apply in all circumstances. If you wish to exercise any of them we will explain at that time if they are engaged or not. The right of data portability is only relevant from May 2018.
