# Privacy Policy - The Nudge

## 1\. What information do we collect?

We gather information that relates to, and can identify you (e.g. your name and address) and information that does not identify you (e.g. browsing patterns that you may exhibit when visiting our website).

We collect information that does not identify you in order to evaluate our site, ensure that our site and all associated services run properly, and to ensure that we're paid for advertising services we offer.

**2)** Directly, for example when you subscribe to our newsletter or purchase goods via The Nudge Insider.

## 3\. Use of your information

**3.2** We might use your personal information to:

**1)** Remember you when you visit our website and track your browsing patterns by using cookies. You can prevent this; section 5 deals with this in more detail.

**4.2** You have the right to access the personal information held about you. To obtain a copy of the personal information we hold about you, please send an email to info@theNudge.com. There will be an administrative charge of £10 for providing a copy of this information.

## 5\. Cookies

**5.1** A cookie is a small piece of information that is placed on your computer when you visit certain websites. Find out more about the use of cookies on http://www.cookiecentral.com.

**5.2** We use cookies to:

**1)** Remember you when you visit this website to keep track of your browsing patterns and to build up a profile of how you and other users use the website.

**2)** Make our website work as efficiently as possible.

**3)** Administer services to you and to advertisers.

**5.3** Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. To do this look at the "help" menu on your browser. Switching off cookies may restrict your use of the website and/or delay or affect the way in which it operates.

## 6\. Third party advertising cookies

**6.1** Most of the advertisements you see on the website are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own cookies (or web beacons) to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once. These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes. The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users of the website).

**6.2** If you would like to disable "third party" cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party's website and getting them to generate a one-time "no thanks" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your machine. 

The following are links to the main third party advertising and analytics platforms we use, each of which provides instructions on how to do this:

**DoubleClick**  <http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/ad-cookies>

**Google AdSense**  <http://www.google.com/intl/en/ads>

**Facebook**  [http://www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com/)

**6.3** You can also visit the trade body representing these advertising companies for more information on how to opt out of these cookies: <http://youronlinechoices.com/>

## 7\. Security

**7.1** The password you provide when registering with the website is encrypted to ensure protection against unauthorised access to your personal information.

**7.2** We do our utmost to protect user privacy. No data transmission over the Internet can be entirely secure, and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and/or use of the website.
