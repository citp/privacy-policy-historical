# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

The Star-Banner is dedicated to providing visitors to starbanner.com and its other online services with a highly interactive and personalized experience, while at the same time protecting

users from unexpected use of personally identifiable information. Like other Web publishers we collect information from users in order to deliver more individualized content and advertising to them, but only within the limits specified in this policy.

**Not Collected:**

A user can access our web sites and utilize many of their services without providing any information at all. Nor do we follow a user's browsing path outside of our web sites. We do develop summary - not individual - reports for our advertisers. The people that make it possible for the user to use starbanner.com for free - our advertisers - need this information to  
determine how effective their advertising investments are. We never tell our advertisers the identity of a user who saw or clicked on their advertisements unless the user has expressly given permission to do so.

**How We Gather Information from Users**

We occasionally gather individually identifiable information that you provide to us on a voluntary basis in connection with activities other than accessing our sites. For example, information may be gathered from: sweepstakes and contest registration or submissions; voting and polling activities; message boards and chat rooms; registration for subscription services related to either the printed or electronic editions of the newspaper; or from other interactive areas of our sites. In connection with our current and planned electronic commerce services, you will be asked to provide information, including credit card information, that is necessary to complete a transaction you have requested.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small data file that a web site transfers to a user's hard drive when a user visits the web site. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is that which a user supplies. A cookie can't read data off a hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. starbanner.com uses cookies as part of its online discussion forums, to store usernames and passwords voluntarily contributed by users who "log in" to the forums. Users who visit and post to the forums without creating a username and password can avoid using cookies. starbanner.com does not use cookies on any other part of its site.

**Other Information We Collect**

In order to determine what the most popular areas of our site are, starbanner.com also keeps track of on-site traffic, i.e. page views and ad impressions. Over time, in order to anticipate your needs and to improve the product, we may link these usage patterns with individual customers or  
groups of customers.

**Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online.

**Affiliated and Linked Sites**

Starbanner.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that our promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, third-party Internet

sites, and content providers accessible through our site may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. starbanner.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. Users should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through co-branded, affiliated or linked sites. While on our site, you may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers or promotional partners.

The placement of cookies by third-party servers is common on the Internet. starbanner.com does not control the use of these cookies or the resulting information; therefore, these cookies are not subject to starbanner.com's privacy policy. Finally, you should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, or other messages) on message boards or in chat areas of starbanner.com, that information can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of starbanner.com.

**Children**

starbanner.com does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical.

**Policy Changes**

The foregoing policy is effective as of Sept. 1, 2000. Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the online arena. If we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the sites following the posting of changes  
to these terms will mean you accept those changes. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
