Whenever and wherever we collect, process or use personal data, we take steps to ensure that it is treated securely and in accordance with our privacy policy. Whenever you give us personal data, you are consenting to its collection and use in accordance with this privacy policy (including our use of cookies as explained below).

What personal data do we collect?

We log your Internet Protocol (IP) address in order to receive and send information from and to you over the Internet.

You will be asked to provide some personal data such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address when you register with us, join as a member, make an enquiry, order products or services from us, or use our discussion forum.

Warning

Bear in mind that if you post any personal data to any discussion forum (chat room), it may be seen by anyone visiting the website. Do not post any data that you do not want to be made public in this way, and do not post any personal data about anyone else without their permission.

Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of data or message that is sent from a web server to your browser and is stored on your hard drive. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Cookies do not damage your system.

You can reset your browser so as to refuse any cookie or to alert you to when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept our cookies, some of the features of our site may not work as well as we intend. We only use cookies for the purposes of system administration of our website and to give us information about the number of visitors to different parts of our website - we do not use them to identify you.

How do we use your personal data?

Where appropriate, we use your personal data to:

  * provide goods and services to you or your organisation;
  * let you know about other goods and services in which you may be interested; and
  * inform you about changes and improvements to our website.



As part of your registration or membership, you will receive e-mail communications alerting you to news and offers. You may, of course, choose not to receive these.

Transfer of data

When you give us personal data, those data may be sent electronically to servers anywhere in the world and may be used, stored and processed anywhere in the world, including countries outside the European Economic Area. Bear in mind that many countries outside the EEA do not adequately protect your rights as a data subject.

To whom might we disclose your personal data?

We may pass your personal data to anyone who needs the data in order to fulfil your order(s) for our goods and services, or to execute the communications we send to you.

Except as set out above, we will not disclose your personal information unless we are obliged to do so or allowed to do so by law, or where we need to do so in order to run our business (for instance where other people process data for us). In such circumstances, we ask those other people to give us confidentiality or non-disclosure undertakings.
