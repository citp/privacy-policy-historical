# Chive Media Group

The following Privacy Policy covers all of the websites of Chive Media Group, LLC, Resignation Holdings, LLC and all subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Chive Media Group”), as well as the Mobile Services (as defined below) or desktop application services, software, or other materials or services made available on, from, or through Chive Media Group’s websites (collectively, the “Websites”). This policy does not, however, apply to entities that Chive Media Group does not own or control, such as applications and websites using Facebook Platform. If you create a Chive Media Group account using Facebook or another third-party social media service, or if you link your Chive Media Group account with any of these third-party services, we may share your information with these third-party services. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by the Websites. Please read this policy. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us.

By using the Websites, you understand and agree that Chive Media Group is providing a platform for you to post content, photos, comments and other materials (collectively, “User Submissions”) to the Websites and to share User Submissions publicly. This means that other users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Submissions that you make publicly available through the Websites, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and Chive Media Group’s Terms of Use.

Collection and Use of Aggregated Information

Chive Media Group creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to users of the Websites. They may also be provided to advertisers, sponsors, and partners; however, they contain no individual personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. This allows Chive Media Group’s advertisers, partners, and sponsors to advertise more effectively, as well as allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs.

Ownership of Information

Chive Media Group is the sole owner of the information collected on the Websites. This includes: 

i. Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an account on a Websites.

ii. Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows Chive Media Group to help others find your profile on the Websites.

iii. User Submissions that you post to the Website.

iv. Communications between you and Chive Media Group. 

Chive Media Group may offer certain services that are available via a mobile device or app, including (1) the ability to upload User Submissions to the Websites via a mobile device, (2) the ability to browse the Websites from a mobile device and (3) the ability to access certain features through an application downloaded and installed on a mobile device (collectively, “Mobile Services”). If you use Mobile Services, Chive Media Group may store information regarding your mobile device, including your device type and operating system, the advertising ID of your mobile device, location services (if you grant permission), or in other applications as permitted by the functionality of such mobile device. 

In addition, Chive Media Group may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify it. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Chive Media Group. A device identifier may deliver information to Chive Media Group or to a third-party partner about how a user browses the Websites and may help Chive Media Group or a partner provide user reports, personalized content or targeted ads. Some features of the Websites may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.

How We Use Your Information

Chive Media Group uses the information you provide, or that we collect, to provide services and features to you; to operate, maintain, and enhance its Websites; to provide users with customer support; as well as to track user-generated content and users to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable laws. Chive Media Group also uses information to prevent potentially illegal activities. These efforts may, on occasion, result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.

Chive Media Group may also contact you with announcements related to the Websites from time to time. You may opt out of all communications, except essential updates on your account.

Chive Media Group does not share your information with advertisers without your consent. Chive Media Group allows advertisers to choose the characteristics of users who will see their advertisements and Chive Media Group may use any of the non-personally identifiable attributes it has collected (including information you may have decided not to show to other users, such as your birth year or other sensitive personal information or preferences) to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.

Even though Chive Media Group does not share your information with advertisers without your consent, when you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, there is a possibility the advertiser may place a cookie in your browser or the advertising ID for the Mobile Services and note that it meets the criteria they selected.

Chive Media Group may share User Submissions and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that Chive Media Group is part of, or that become part of that group (“Affiliates”). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Websites and Affiliates’ own services; however, these Affiliates will honor the choices you make about who can and cannot see your photos.

In addition to other information described in this policy, we may collect and share precise location information, through methods such as mobile “SDKs”. This location information may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with mobile identifiers (such as IDFAs and Android IDs), and shared with third parties, for purposes related to advertising, attribution (e.g., measuring ad performance) analytics and research. You can remove your consent to having your location data collected by changing the settings on your device. (Certain services may lose functionality as a result.) You can opt-out from any interest-based advertising through your device settings. When you have opted out using this setting on a device, advertisers will not use in-app information collected from that device to infer your interests or serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests.
