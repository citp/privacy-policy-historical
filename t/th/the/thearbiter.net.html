    <p class="normal">Advanced Business Technology, Inc. (developers of ‘The 
      Arbiter’)</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Privacy Statement</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">ABT Corporation ("Advanced Business Technology") has created 
      this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your 
      privacy. This document describes ABT’s practices with respect to the collection 
      of user information from this website and the use and disclosure of such 
      information. This document only applies to the ABT site www.TheArbiter.net and 
      our Arbiter Online URL and does not address the privacy of information we 
      obtain from places other than our website. In addition, other sites on the web 
      (including those we link to) have their own privacy policies and practices. In 
      all cases we encourage you to ask questions and to provide data only to sites 
      whose practices and personnel you trust.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Information collected and how it’s used</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">We do not collect any personally identifying information about 
      you unless you or the organization to which you belong voluntarily submits such 
      information to us. The information that we have about you is sensitive 
      information and we are diligent in our efforts to protect it. Depending on your 
      group and the particular Arbiter features they use, that information may 
      include your name, address, phone numbers, email address, social security 
      number, and date of birth. Some or all of this information may be necessary for 
      the application to perform some function correctly or for providing information 
      required or requested by government agencies. When requesting technical support 
      you may be asked to provide some personal information that we deem necessary to 
      identify who you are and to associate you with one of our user groups. An ABT 
      sales representative may contact you to determine if you are interested in 
      other ABT products or services. Such representative may ask you if you would 
      like to receive additional information on our products and services. If you are 
      not interested, please advise the ABT sales representative accordingly, and you 
      will not be contacted again by ABT. From time to time, we may also notify you 
      about new products and services we are offering. If you do not want to receive 
      such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information.</p>
    <p class="normal">ABT collects user information to make it easier and more 
      efficient for you to use our site. We collect non-personally identifying 
      information about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities 
      through your IP address or most-recently-visited URL or through "cookies". (For 
      more information on IP addresses or Cookies, please see the appropriate 
      sections below). We may eventually use such information to tailor the content, 
      services and advertising on our websites to your current and future needs. 
      Non-personally identifying information might include the type of browser you 
      use, the type of computer, the operating system, the Internet service provider 
      and other similar information. We use such information in the aggregate to 
      understand how our users as a group use the services and resources provided on 
      our site. This way we know which areas of our site are the most commonly used, 
      which areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that we 
      may continually improve our site.</p>
    <p class="normal">In addition, in connection with an assignment, sale, joint 
      venture or other transfer or disposition of some or all of the assets of the 
      ABT Corporation or its affiliated entities to third party successors in 
      interest, you acknowledge and agree that we can accordingly assign, sell, 
      license or transfer any information, including personally identifying 
      information, that our visitors have provided to us to such third parties.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">Cookies are small text files that are written to your computer. 
      They make our website easier for you to use because they save your preferences 
      while you’re at our site (although we do not save your passwords in cookies). 
      Cookies contain information that the server computer "knew" in the first place, 
      and are designed to only be read by the serving domain that placed them. 
      Cookies are a standard part of Internet use and allow server computers to 
      recognize your computer’s browser when you return to our site. For example, a 
      cookie may retain information regarding items that remain in your shopping cart 
      when you leave our site so that you don’t have to start your shopping again 
      from scratch when you return. The non-personally identifying information that 
      we track with cookies is anonymous and is not used to identify, or lead us back 
      to, any particular visitor.</p>
    <p class="normal">Most browsers are set to accept cookies. You can set your 
      browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you 
      elect not to accept cookies, please note that some parts of the ABT site, such 
      as shopping, contests or games, may not function properly, or at all, or may be 
      considerably slower.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>IP Address</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your 
      computer whenever you’re using the WorldWideWeb. Web servers – the big 
      computers that "serve up" web pages – automatically identify your computer by 
      its IP address.</p>
    <p class="normal">We may also use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our 
      site, track users’ movements and gather broad demographic information for 
      aggregate use. IP addresses are not normally linked to personally identifying 
      information. This means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the 
      visitor remains anonymous to us.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">As part of the registration process, ABT may provide you with 
      the option of receiving information from third parties. If you select this 
      option, ABT will transfer your contact information to third parties. If you do 
      not want to receive information from third parties in the future, call the ABT 
      Customer Support Department at 1-801-576-9436. (Please note that ABT is not 
      responsible for removing your information from third party lists or entities 
      with which you have previously authorized ABT to share your information.) You 
      will need to contact those third parties directly to request removal from their 
      lists. Unless we tell you otherwise, we do not sell or rent your personally 
      identifying information to any third parties. We will notify you at the time of 
      data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and 
      you will have the option of not permitting the transfer. If you do not wish 
      your data to be shared, you can choose not to use a particular service or not 
      to participate in certain promotions or contests.</p>
    <p class="normal">We may sell and rent aggregated information about our users 
      generally to our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third 
      parties. We also may produce aggregated reports for advertisers identifying, 
      for example, the number of users that visit our site or different areas of our 
      site, the number of users that clicked on an advertisement or the number of 
      users that read a particular article. Aggregate information refers to 
      information that cannot be directly linked to a specific individual. For 
      example, we may know that 25,000 people visited our site today, or that 75% of 
      those visitors were women but we don’t know their names. We may use aggregate 
      information to customize our content and advertising, or to deliver a better 
      experience for our visitors. Aggregated information does not include personally 
      identifying information about you or your use of our site.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Disclosure of Information in Special Circumstances</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">ABT reserves the right to disclose information in special cases 
      when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to 
      identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating 
      ABT’s Terms of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either 
      intentionally or unintentionally) ABT’s rights or property, other ABT users, or 
      anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. ABT may disclose or access 
      account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and 
      for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, 
      service and improve our products and services.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Opt out</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">You can help ABT maintain the accuracy of your personal 
      information by notifying us when you change your address, phone number or email 
      address. Users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their 
      information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point 
      where we ask for the information. For example, our download form has an opt-in 
      option so users who download the trial software from us but don’t want to 
      receive any marketing materials. Users who no longer wish to receive our 
      newsletter may remove their name from the distribution list at any time by 
      going to http://www.TheArbiter.com/unsubscribe and filling out the short form 
      provided with their name and email address or by calling us at 1-801-576-9436. 
      If you have subscribed under more than one email address, you will need to 
      unsubscribe for each of your email addresses.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Links to other Sites</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">Users will find advertising or other content on our site that 
      links to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, 
      sponsors, licensors and other third parties. In many cases, the links represent 
      cooperative projects or are mutual links established with persons or entities 
      connected with our site. We do not control the content or links that appear on 
      these third party sites. In addition, these third party sites or services, 
      including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These third 
      party sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer 
      service policies, or no policy at all. We encourage you to review the privacy 
      policies of any third party site or service before providing any of them with 
      your personal information.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Minors</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">ABT’s site is not designed for minors and therefore does not 
      collect or want any personally identifying information from children.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">Protecting your privacy and your information is a priority at 
      ABT. We do not rent or sell the personal financial information you provide to 
      us. We use industry-standard methods to protect your personally identifying 
      information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we usually store 
      such information on a computer behind a "firewall" in a secure location, and we 
      take measures to restrict the number of employees internally who can access 
      such data. When our registration or order form asks users to enter sensitive 
      information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and 
      protected using industry-standard encryption technology – 128-bit encryption 
      SSL (Secure Socket Layers). In addition, as an added security measure, if you 
      use a credit card to make a purchase on our site, an ABT representative may 
      call you to verify the transaction.</p>
    <p class="normal">While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
      online, we also take steps to protect user information off-line. Access to all 
      of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, 
      is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to 
      perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service 
      representative) are granted access to personally identifying information. 
      Furthermore, employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy policies 
      and practices. Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifying 
      information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
    <p class="normal">Of course, there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the 
      Internet and no data transmission can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, 
      while we strive to protect your personal information, ABT cannot and does not 
      ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or via our 
      site, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Passwords</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">Your ABT account information is password protected so that only 
      you are authorized to access this personal information. We strongly recommend 
      that you do not divulge your password to anyone. ABT will not ask for your 
      password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Amendments</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">We may change this policy from time to time to address new 
      issues and reflect changes on our site. We will post those changes here (and 
      such changes become effective upon posting) so that you will know what 
      information we collect, how we might use that information, and whether we 
      disclose that information to anyone. Please refer back to this policy 
      regularly.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Your Acceptance of these Terms</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">By accessing and using the ABT site, you signify your agreement 
      to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, 
      please do not access or use our site. Your continued use of the ABT site 
      following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you 
      accept those changes.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong>Additional Information</strong></p>
    <p class="normal">If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please 
      contact our Customer Support Department by phone 1-801-576-9436 email 
      support@TheArbiter.com.</p>
