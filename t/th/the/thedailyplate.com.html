<b>The Daily Plate Privacy Policy</b>

<b>Effective
Date: May 8, 2008</b>
<br><br>Your
privacy is important to The Daily Plate ("The Daily Plate", "we" or "us").
This
Privacy and Information Security Policy ("the Policy") discusses the
personally identifying information ("PII") that we collect about you when you
use our website <a href="http://www.thedailyplate.com/">http://www.thedailyplate.com</a>
(the "Site") and the other services we provide on or through the Site (together
with the Site, the "Service").
This Policy is part of and incorporated into <a href="/tou">The
Daily Plate Terms of Use</a> (collectively, the "Terms").

<br><br>Policy
highlights:
<ul>
<li>We will not collect PII about
you through the Service unless you disclose such information to us;</li>
<li>We will not knowingly disclose
PII about you that we collect through the Service to third parties, except
under the limited circumstances described in this Policy; and</li>
<li>We will take reasonable steps
to protect the security of the PII we collect from you through the Service.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>These
Policy highlights are qualified in full by reference to the terms described
below.
<br><br><b>BY
PROVIDING PII OR OTHER INFORMATION TO US OR BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO
THIS POLICY AND THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THE POLICY.</b>
<br><br><b>1.
</b><b><u>INFORMATION
YOU GIVE US</u></b>.
<br><br>a.
<u>The
Types of Information The Daily Plate Collects</u>.
We collect any information
you enter on the Service or give us in any other way (such as through an email,
survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies depending upon how
you use our Service.
Our account registration process requires that you
provide us with your user name, birthday and email address, and that you create
and provide us with a password.
We may also request other information, such as
but not limited to, your actual first and last name, gender, and zip code.
You
may access and update certain of your personal information or account settings by
going to the "Profile" tab on the Site.
<br><br>b.
<u>Information
in Public Areas of the Site</u>.
Please keep in mind that whenever you
voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Service, such as the
user profile pages or forums, that information can be viewed and possibly used
by others.
We therefore advise visitors not to disclose contact information,
including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger
address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share.
We are not
responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas.
Also, we may
highlight content you post to the public areas of the Service such as reviews
or comments, such as by featuring your content on the Site’s home page.

<br><br>c.
<u>Minors</u>.
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under
the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register.
If you are under
13, do not attempt to register for our Site or send any information about
yourself to us.
We recommend that prospective users between the ages of 13 and
17 ask their parents or other legal guardians for permission before sending any
information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
<br><br><b>2.
</b><b><u>AUTOMATIC
INFORMATION COLLECTION</u></b>.
<br><br>a.
<u>Cookies</u>.
Like many websites, we use "cookies."
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers
that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to
enable our systems to recognize your browser.
We use persistent, identifying
cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you.
While
you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the
Service may not function and appear as we have designed it.
Nonetheless, if
you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions
associated with your browser.
Our cookies do not collect PII that you provide
to us during the registration process, but they do collect other information
such as the following:
<br><br>
i.     the domain name and host from which
you access the Internet and the Internet address of the site from which you
direct-linked to ours;
<br><br>
ii.     the date and time you access
the Site and pages you visit;
<br><br>
iii.     your computer's IP address
and information about its operating system, platform and the Web browser type
and version you use;
<br><br>
iv.     demographic and other
non-personally identifiable profile information about you; and
<br><br>
v.     information to combat fraud
or misuse.
<br><br>b.
<u>Pixel Tags</u>.
In our email to you, we use "pixel tags" to determine if your email software
or service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of
our email messages and conserve bandwith).
<br><br>c.
<u>Collection of
Information by Third Parties</u>.
Our Site may include third-party advertising,
links to other websites, and other content from third party businesses. The
content posted by these parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from
a third party.
We do not provide any PII to these advertisers, third-party
websites, or other businesses, although on occasion we may mutually share
non-personally identifiable (e.g., demographic) information to facilitate
delivery of relevant advertisements.
These third-party websites, businesses,
and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes
use technology to deliver (or "serve") the advertisements that appear
on our Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP
address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons
(also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to
measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize or optimize
advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other
technologies that they may use, and the information practices of these
advertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this
Policy but are covered by their respective privacy policies. Some, but not all,
third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their
technology.
For more information and an identification of advertisers that
provide an opt-out mechanism, please click the following: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.

<br><br>d.
<u>Promotions,
Sweepstakes, and Contests</u>.
From time to time, we may host a promotion,
sweepstake, or contest on the Service.
You may be asked to provide personal
information or permit the transfer to a third party of your personal
information in connection with such promotion, sweepstake or contest.
It will
be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collecting or
transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will
be your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer or collection of
personal information to a third party.
<br><br><b>3.
</b><b><u>THE
DAILY PLATE’S USE AND RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</u>. </b>
<br><br>a.
<u>Use of PII</u>.
We use your PII for purposes such as responding to your requests, monitoring
and providing the Service, maintaining your The Daily Plate account, providing
you with advertising and non-advertising content that we believe would be of
interest to you, enforcing our rights and the rights of third parties, and
investigating and ensuring compliance with the <a href="/tou">Terms</a>.
We also may use
your PII to contact you regarding your account, such as to inform you that you
have received an email from another The Daily Plate member, or to forward user
comments to you about the content that you have posted.
We may also email The
Daily Plate newsletters, and similar communications about the Service.
<b> </b>
<br><br>b.
<u>Opting-Out</u>.
Subject to the exceptions noted below, at any time, you may modify the types
of communications you wish to receive by changing your preferences as part of
your profile on the Site.
We reserve the right to send you
customary business communications such as acceptance/rejection notices
regarding content submissions, general system and administrative messages
regarding the Service, address confirmations, and transactional information
about your account, and we may not offer you the opportunity to opt-out of
receiving such communications so long as you are registered with the Site.
<br><br>c.
<u>Use of Other
Information</u>. We use non-PII about our users for purposes such as measuring
the number of visitors to sections of our Site, making the Service more useful
to visitors and delivering targeted advertising and non-advertising content.
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user’s
movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate,
non-personally identifiable use.
<br><br>d.
<u>Retention of
Information</u>.
We retain information for as long as required,
allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations.
We
may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to
applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of
information.
You must keep your own, separate back-up records.
<br><br><b>4.
</b><b><u>THE
DAILY PLATE’S SHARING OF INFORMATION</u></b>.
The Daily Plate shares information with third parties,
but only as described in this Section 4.
<br><br>a.
<u>Advertisers
and Others</u>.
We share non-personally identifiable information
with advertisers, service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct
business. Similarly, these advertisers, service providers, and other persons
may share with us non-PII about you that they have independently gathered or
acquired.
<br><br>b.
<u>Third
Party Services</u>.
We contract with affiliated and non-affiliated third
parties to provide services to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include
providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, sending The Daily Plate emails
to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing
data. These third parties may have access to your PII for use solely in
connection with these authorized business activities.
<br><br>c.
<u>Business Transfer</u>.
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets,
or engage in acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes of control, or
similar transactions.
In such transactions, customer information generally is
one of the transferred business assets, and your PII may be subject to such a
transfer.
Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, customer information
may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession and then to
a subsequent purchaser.
<br><br>d.
<u>Affiliates</u><b>.</b>
<b>We may share PII,
non-PII and other information with our corporate affiliates.</b> <b>Some of our most
significant affiliates are identified on the website of <a href="http://www.demandmedia.com/">Demand
Media, Inc.</a></b>
Corporate affiliates are those entities that we control, are controlled by us,
or are under common control with us and any joint venture in which any of the
controlled entities may participate from time to time. Any use of your information
by our corporate affiliates is subject to this Policy or another policy no less
protective of your privacy.
Conversely, we may obtain information about you
from our corporate affiliates or from your visits to other websites that we or
our corporate affiliates control.

<br><br>e.
<u>Compliance
and Safety</u><b>.</b> We may release user information when we believe release is appropriate
to:
<br><br>
i.     comply with applicable law,
and to respond to legal process, including subpoenas, search warrants and court
orders, and to respond to or otherwise address written complaints of copyright
infringement;
<br><br>
ii.     make disclosures under
programs intended to prevent potential crimes or investigate persons;
<br><br>
iii.     enforce or apply agreements,
including the Terms; or
<br><br>
iv.     protect the rights,
property, or safety of The Daily Plate, our users, or others, including
exchanging information with other companies for fraud protection and credit
risk reduction.
<br><br><b>5.
</b><b><u>INFORMATION
SECURITY</u></b>
<br><br>a.
<u>Your
Obligations</u>.
You must protect against unauthorized access to your password
and to your computer. Please sign off when finished using a shared computer.
Your emails to us are not necessarily secure against interception so do not
include sensitive information in them.
We generally will not ask for passwords
in an email and you should assume that if you get such a request, it might be
fraudulent.<b> YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b>
<br><br>b.
<u>Our
Security Measures</u>.
We take reasonable precautions to protect the security
of our users’ information.
We have physical, electronic, and managerial
procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
security, and correctly use your information.
However, neither people nor
security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems.
In addition,
people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies.
Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your PII, we cannot
guarantee its absolute security.
If applicable law imposes any
non-disclaimable duty to protect your PII, you agree that intentional misconduct
will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.
<br><br><b>6.
</b><b><u>LINKS</u>.
</b>The Service
contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices
of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site and
to read the privacy statements of every web site that collects your personally
identifiable information. This Policy applies only to information collected by
the Service.
<br><br><b>7.

OF USE, NOTICES, AND REVISIONS</u>.

law to request information from us, write us at our Legal Notice address (see
the next section of this Policy) and we will let you know what additional
information you must provide to us. After we have received that information, we
will supply without charge the information legally required to be disclosed
that we then have, subject to applicable law and reserving all of our rights
and defenses.
<br><br>d.
<u>Revisions</u>.
We reserve the right to change
our Policy at any time.
Non-material changes and clarifications will take
effect immediately.

top of this page the revised Policy’s new effective date.

changes, we will notify you by email or through notice on the home page of the
Site, and will also indicate so at the top of this page.
