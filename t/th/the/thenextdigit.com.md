## **Personal and Connected Information**

In accordance with the current Privacy Policy, our website distinguishes between two types of personal information and these are: information that is personally provided by our readers and information that is automatically collected upon readers’ visit on our website. By personal information, we refer to personal details related to names, addresses, emails, telephone numbers and similar data, which is provided by readers while subscribing to one of our services or creating their own account. The non-personal information, that is, the information that is automatically collected when users enter our website, comprises data that is connected to a reader’s online person, but not exclusively related. IP addresses, domain names of Internet providers, web browsing preferences and other similar details are usually labeled as non-personal information. Our website uses special algorithms to collect information about our readers’ favorite search terms, websites, as well as the time they usually spend on our pages.

We attribute great important to our readers’ privacy; therefore, we will take care not to disclose any of their personal information without their prior consent. We will only use this data to help our website administrators stay in contact with our readers, contact them and improve our online services for our customers. We put our readers’ preferences first; therefore, we may sometimes ask our readers to take part in online survey so we can better understand them. Occasionally, we may share your data with third parties that are in charge of our customer support and promotional services. Readers, who do not want to share their contact details with our third party operators can de-register from our services and/or specify their wish for their personal data not to be shared with affiliated companies. We may also use your personal details for our vendors, particularly when hired to carry out services on our behalf. Vendors carry out marketing promotions, data analysis, customer services, etc.

Our readers need to understand that it is very important for us to gather their personal and connected information because we can thus better understand their online behavior and their preferences. Our company and our affiliated companies have the liberty to freely use this data to analyze website traffic, online trends and to create promotional campaigns for our online services. Our website uses cookies, email addresses and/or IP addresses to collect non-personal information from our readers, but there could be other methods we could use in the future, as well.

Yet, the borders in our real life are many times continued on the Internet to prevent problems and complications. Consequently, we expect our website, which has been designed in keeping with local laws, to be primarily visited by U.S. residents. Should there be non-U.S. readers, they must know that they are wholeheartedly welcome as long as they consent to our Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy pages. We are using U.S. laws and regulations to ensure the protection of personal information on our website, but readers should double check as there may be differences between the U.S. and the non-U.S. legal frameworks.

Our website has been designed for grownups, who have already accomplished 13 years old. Readers, who are not 13 are prohibited to use our website and our website pages. Nevertheless, there is not age-gradation on the content of our website as is the case with many other online platforms.

We do not collect personal information from underage readers, who are also younger than 13 years old. Tutors, parents, guardians, who have found out that an underage user has provided personal information on our website are asked to immediately contact us to remove the said data. Our website administrators, in their turn, will contact us as soon as they receive information that a child has provided personal information on our website. The Next Digit takes full responsibility to remove such information should there be any notifications in this sense.

### **Contact Us**

Readers, visitors and returning visitors can address us questions, can make suggestions and file complaints in relation to our Privacy Policy by accessing our Contact Us page. We will read all their emails and respond to them in the shortest time possible. The Next Digit takes its liberty to ignore those messages that do not comply with the general rules of netiquette and/or are not grounded on solid arguments.
