For years The DMA has developed guidelines and programs to help marketers meet consumer privacy expectations. By providing consumers with notice of information practices and the ability to remove their names from lists, marketers have demonstrated their commitment to protecting consumer privacy. As interactive media evolve, The DMA and its membership renew their commitment to offer notice and opt-out in this new medium. 

To reduce the amount of unsolicited commercial mail, telephone contact or e-mail from DMA member companies, you may submit an online form by going to <http://www.the-dma.org/consumers/consumerassistance.html>. To take your name off DMA contact lists only, use the mailing address above or e-mail us at [ customer@the-dma.org](mailto:customer@the-dma.org?subject=The%20DMA%20Web%20Site%20Privacy%20Policy).
