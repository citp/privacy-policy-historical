**Privacy Policy**

We have great respect for your privacy. In order to keep you informed of our privacy practices concerning this website, we have provided the following privacy policy. If you have questions, please direct them to [our privacy handler](mailto:privacy@nFusion.com). 

**Personal Information and Your Privacy**

Our web site is dynamically personalized just for you. We collect demographic data based on your browsing choices, and also when you fill out your user profile on our site in order to help you find the information you are looking for. That demographic information will not be linked to you as an individual without your explicit consent in the registration process -- and you can register for a later contact without allowing us to link that information with you personally. The choice is yours, but we can serve you better the more you tell us about your needs. 

Aggregate usage information for our website is collected and analyzed in order to help us improve the web site. This information is collected in aggregate form and is generally not associated with any personal information. We use the [Webtrends Live](http://www.webtrendslive.com/) software to track aggregate website usage, and our use of this information conforms to their [privacy policy](http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.htm). 

Personal information provided to us directly (for example, registering for our newsletter, or providing contact information so we can contact you) will not be sold or rented to any third party. We will use the information for our normal business operations, which may require that we provide it to administrators, consultants, vendors, or others operating on our behalf. Aggregate or demographic data may be shared with clients or consultants in aggregate form only. 

**Cookies**

Our website makes use of cookies to enable the personalized functionality of the site. These cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. If you wish, you may configure your browser to reject cookies, though this may cause some website functions to be disabled. 

**Security**

We are committed to keeping your personal information safe. We do not collect any personally sensitive information, aside from contact information. We do not knowingly collect information from children. 

**Email**

We may occasionally send targeted mailings to specific market segments. Lists for electronic mailings are acquired only from legitimate opt-in vendors or existing customer lists. Lists for physical mailings are acquired from traditional sources. If you believe you were sent something in error, or are having trouble unsubscribing, please mail [our mail abuse handler](mailto:abuse@nFusion.com) to ensure that appropriate action can be taken. We use only opt-in lists, so if you didn't opt-in, we want to know! 

**Limitation of Scope**

This policy is official only in regard to our website. It does not necessarily reflect privacy practices for other divisions of our organization, or other organizations with which we do business. 

**Notification of Changes**

We will make a good-faith effort to notify registered users via email if this policy changes. However, we reserve the right to make changes without notice. 

**Questions**

If you have questions about your privacy on our site, please contact our [privacy officer](mailto:privacy@nFusion.com).
