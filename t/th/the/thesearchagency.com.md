# Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to us at The Search Agency. The following Privacy Policy covers The Search Agency's collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information of our clients and of users of our online services through the "Client Control Center" area of our website located at [www.thesearchagency.com](http://www.thesearchagency.com/)(the "Site"). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" or "information" refers to identifying information such as your name, physical address, email address, telephone number, etc. Please take a moment to read the following to learn about our information collection, storage, use, and disclosure practices.

Why Do We Collect Personal Information?  
The Search Agency collects relevant personal information because it enables us to give clients convenient access to our services. In particular, personal information is used to create a client profile for clients who register to use our Client Control Center. The Client Control Center provides our clients with tools that help them analyze the performance of advertising campaigns and make adjustments to improve the results of those campaigns. In addition, the collected personal information allows us to notify our clients and other Site users of products and services that we think may be of interest.

What Personal Information Do We Collect?  
Information You Give Us. We collect personal information from clients who choose to provide us with this information. For example, we obtain personal information when you register to use our Client Control Center. This information includes, for example, your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, relevant search engine account information, and security or access code/password. Site users and clients can choose not to provide us with certain personal information, but then they may not be able to access the Client Control Center or to fully take advantage of certain features of our Site.

Automatic Collection of Information.   
Like many websites on the Internet, we employ the use of "cookies" in certain areas of our Site to allow us to provide information which is targeted to Site users and clients' interests. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a user's browser from a Web server and stored on their computer's hard drive. The Search Agency does not allow other companies to deliver cookies to Site users or clients while on the Site. We also use the cookies set in our client's websites in order to gather accurate client site tracking information (e.g. clicks, sign-ups, and revenues). You are always free to decline any cookies we use, if your browser permits.

Who is Collecting Your Information?  
When you provide information through the Site, the information is transmitted through the Internet and stored on servers that The Search Agency owns and maintains. We do not share the information stored on our server with third parties unless our clients are informed in advance otherwise.

With Whom Do We Share Your Information?  
Please note that The Search Agency does not sell or rent your personal information to marketing companies. With client permission, we may share information with third parties, such as search engine account managers, in order to provide our advertising services. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own consumer privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection, storage, use, or disclosure of your information. Please note that the information practices of those third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of relevant third parties or contact the respective Webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding their information collection, storage, use, and disclosure practices.

In addition, we will share the personal information we collect from you under the following circumstances:

Protection of Rights  
We will release user information: (1) to third parties (i.e. search engine account managers, with your permission, in order to optimize your advertising campaigns); (2) if we believe the law requires it or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities to comply with legal process, such as court order or subpoena; (3) if we believe such action is appropriate to enforce the Terms of Use for the Site; or (4) if we believe such action is appropriate to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of The Search Agency, its employees, other Site users, or others.

Asset Transfers   
If we chose to sell some or all of our assets, user information, including the information collected from you, could be included in the transferred assets.

Independent Contractors   
We may share the information with independent contractors that we hire from time to time in connection with the performance of our advertising services, the operation of the Site, or other operation(s) related to our business. From time to time, we may disclose in published research reports information, in aggregated form, that we collect from you.

Control of Your Information  
You can correct, update, or delete the information that you provide The Search Agency by accessing your account through the Client Control Center or sending an email to [privacypolicy@thesearchagency.com](mailto:atprivacypolicy@thesearchagency.com).

Security  
The personal information that clients provide to The Search Agency is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. In addition, all of The Search Agency's personnel who have access to such information are trained in the maintenance and security of such information, and we limit access of such information by our employees to the information reasonably required in order to provide prompt, high quality service. However, no server, computer network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through our Site, and you provide such information to us and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our server.

Children's Privacy  
The Site is a general audience website and no portion of the Site is directed to children under the age of 13. We do not collect personal identifying information from any person we actually know is a child under the age of 13.

Summary  
At The Search Agency, protecting your privacy is important to us. By accessing and using the Site, you consent to the collection, storage, use, and disclosure of information by The Search Agency as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is subject to change from time to time and we will post all changes on this page.
