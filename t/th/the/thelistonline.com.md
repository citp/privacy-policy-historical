Surveys

Surveys are one method by which we gather information about our clients. From time to time, we request client input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. 

Cookies

A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store in a Web browser so that it can later be read back from that browser. The List uses cookies to store personal preferences for your future visits. Cookies allow us to quickly recognize you, so that your time spent on our site is more personalized and productive. Cookies are an industry standard and are used at most major Web sites in much the same way we use them here. We may also use cookies in order to collect and analyze statistical information that is used to make The List a more valuable product for our clients. 

Your Consent

By becoming a client of The List, you consent to the collection and use of the previously mentioned information by us. 

Opting Out

We will periodically communicate information about an Account's subscription via emails that will contain Account set-up instructions, renewal notices, and information about product changes. We must maintain an open channel to our customers for these types of communications in order to ensure the integrity of our service, and therefore cannot unsubscribe anyone from these messages.
