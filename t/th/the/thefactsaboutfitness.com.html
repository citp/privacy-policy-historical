              Policy</p>
            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>The following statement explains our policy regarding the personal 
              information we collect about you, and is effective from November 
              9th 2004.</p>
            <p><b>1. Statement of intent</b><br>
              You may be asked to submit personal information about yourself (such 
              as your name and e-mail address) in order to receive or use services 
              on our website. Such services include newsletters, surveys and membership 
              to the site. Whenever you provide such personal information, we 
              will treat that information in accordance with this policy. Our 
              services are designed to give you the information that you want 
              to receive. We will act in accordance with current legislation and 
              aim to meet current Internet best practice.</p>
            <p><b>2. Information on visitors</b><br>
              During the course of any visit to thefactsaboutfitness.com, the 
              pages you see, along with something called a cookie, are downloaded 
              to your computer (see point 3 for more on this). Most, if not all, 
              websites do this, because cookies allow the website publisher to 
              do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably 
              its user) has visited the site before. This is done on a repeat 
              visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on 
              the last visit.</p>
            <p>Any information that is supplied by cookies can help us to provide 
              you with a better service and helps us meet the needs and goals 
              of our visitors.</p>
            <p> Log files provide non-personal statistical information about visits 
              to pages on the site, the duration of individual page view, paths 
              taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors' screen settings 
              and other general information. The factsaboutfitness.com uses this 
              type of information to help it improve the services to its users.</p>
            <p><b>3. What is a cookie?</b><br>
              When you enter a site your computer will automatically be issued 
              with a cookie. Cookies are text files that identify your computer 
              to our server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual 
              user, just the computer used. Many sites do this whenever a user 
              visits their site in order to track traffic flows.</p>
            <p>Cookies themselves only record those areas of the site that have 
              been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Users 
              have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, 
              to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies 
              at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalized 
              services cannot then be provided to that user.</p>
            <p><b>4. Use and storage of your personal information</b><br>
              When you supply any personal information to thefactsaboutfitness.com 
              (e.g. to receive the newsletter) we will explain how we will use 
              it and tell you if we want to pass the information on to anyone 
              else. Any information you provide to thefactsaboutfitness.com will 
              only be used by us. It will never be never rented, traded or sold, 
              unless we are obliged by law to disclose it. </p>
            <p>We will hold your information on our systems for as long as you 
              use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that 
              the purpose has been met, or you request that we remove it.</p>
            <p>If you wish to update your personal information, please send your 
              request to support@thefactsaboutfitness.com</p>
