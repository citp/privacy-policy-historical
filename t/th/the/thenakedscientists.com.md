\- Granting us permission to use cookies:

If the settings on your software that you are using to view this website (your browser) are adjusted to accept cookies, we take this, and your continued use of our website, to mean that you are fine with this. Should you wish to remove or not use cookies from our site you can learn how to do this below, however doing so will likely mean that our site will not work as you would expect.

\- We use cookies to make our website work including:

  * Determining if you are logged in or not
  * Remembering your search settings
  * Allowing you to add comments to our site
  * There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our site.



\- Social Networking Cookies:

  * To enable you to “Like” or share our content via platforms like Facebook and Twitter, we have included sharing buttons on our site. The privacy implications on this will vary from social network to social network and will be dependent on the privacy settings you have chosen on these networks.



\- Anonymous Visitor Statistics Cookies:

  * We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows, which helps to identify when our site isn't working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These so called “analytics” programs may also tell us, on an anonymous basis, how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before. This helps us to best tailor our content to your needs.



\- Advertising Cookies:

  * Cookies are widely used in online advertising. Neither us, advertisers or our advertising partners can gain personally identifiable information from these cookies. We only work with advertising partners who work to accepted privacy standards.
  * You can learn more about online advertising at [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) and opt out of such advertising, although we would prefer that you didn't as ultimately adverts help keep much of the internet free. It is also worth noting that opting out of advertising cookies will not mean you won't see adverts, just simply that they won't be tailored to you any longer.



\- Banner Adverts:

  * We fund our site by showing adverts as you browse our site. These adverts are usually managed by a partner specialising in providing adverts for multiple sites. Invariably these partners place cookies to collect anonymous data about the websites you visit so they can personalise the adverts to you, ensure that you don't see the same adverts too frequently and ultimately report to advertisers on which adverts are working.



\- Turning Cookies Off:

  * You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies (Learn how here). Please note that doing so will limit the functionality of this site.
  * It may be that your concerns around cookies relate to so called "spyware". Rather than switching off cookies in your browser, you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.
