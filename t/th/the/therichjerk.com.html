                    We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm 
                    commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes

                    of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well 
                    as those who may purchase Products and/or pay a monthly service 
                    fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what we do with 
                    the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members 
                    have concerning the collection and use of such info. We request
