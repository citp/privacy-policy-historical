<h2 id="thalmic-labs-inc-">Thalmic Labs Inc.</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. Thalmic Labs Inc. (“Thalmic”) has created the following Privacy Policy to let you know what information we collect when you visit www.thalmic.com (the “Thalmic Site”), why we collect it and how it is used. This Privacy Policy is governed by our Terms of Use. By using the Thalmic Site, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. We may change this Privacy Policy by posting a new version of this Privacy Policy on this Site which it is your responsibility to review.</p>
<h3 id="personally-identifiable-information">Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>“Personally Identifiable Information” means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information, whether at work or at home. Thalmic may ask to collect Personally Identifiable Information from you when you use the Thalmic Site. Thalmic also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie information and the page you request. It is always your choice whether or not you provide us with your Personally Identifiable Information; however, a decision to withhold Personally Identifiable Information may restrict or prevent us from providing you with a particular product or service.</p>
<h3 id="limiting-use-disclosure-and-retention">Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention</h3>
<p>Our collection of Personally Identifiable Information is limited to what is reasonable under the circumstances, and your information will be used for the purpose for which it was collected, or when it is required or permitted by law. We may inform you about products and services by mail, e-mail, text message, telephone, or other means. If you do not wish to receive direct marketing, contact us and tell us that you do not wish to be contacted in a particular manner.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-service-providers">Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to Personally Identifiable Information only to the extent needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. By providing your Personally Identifiable Information to Thalmic in order to obtain Thalmic products or services, you acknowledge and agree that disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information to such third parties may be necessary to provide you with such products and services, and you hereby consent to such disclosure.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-and-disclosing-information">Sharing and Disclosing Information</h3>
<p>Other than as expressly set forth herein, Thalmic does not rent, sell or share personal information it collects about you to or with third parties. Information collected from you is only used to complete and support your purchases from and use of the Thalmic Site and to comply with any requirements of law. However, Thalmic may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Thalmic or the Thalmic Site; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Thalmic; or (3) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Thalmic, its web sites or the public. If Thalmic should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, we may sell the information you provide to us on the Thalmic Site to a third party (in the case of bankruptcy) or share your Personally Identifiable Information with any company with whom we merge – in such situations, Thalmic will require, to the best of its ability, the purchasing or merging party to comply with all confidentiality and privacy requirements as set forth herein respecting your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>Thalmic may combine your information with other information into an aggregate form, so your information no longer personally identifies you. We may then disclose the aggregate information to third parties, so they can obtain an overall picture of Thalmic’s products, services, customer usage patterns and/or other statistical information</p>
<h3 id="security-of-information">Security of Information</h3>
<p>Thalmic will take reasonable precautions to maintain the confidentiality and security of your Personally Identifiable Information so that it is not disclosed to anyone outside our group of companies and our selected third party service providers/business partners without your consent, unless required by law or as otherwise set forth herein. Where possible, Thalmic Labs protects the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input.</p>
<h3 id="international-transfers">International Transfers</h3>
<p>Personal information collected on the Thalmic site may be stored and processed in Canada or any other country in which Thalmic or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Thalmic Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>
<h3 id="maintenance-of-personal-information">Maintenance of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Thalmic has established the following practices regarding the maintenance of your personal information.</p>
<ul>
<li>If, for any reason, you wish to review your personal information that Thalmic has in its possession, you can contact our Privacy Officer, who will be pleased to provide you with all your personal information that Thalmic has on file.</li>
<li>Sometimes, it will be necessary for you to update your personal information Thalmic has on file in order to maintain accuracy. For example, if you move or change credit cards, you may be required to update your information in order to keep receiving the products and services provided by Thalmic. If you wish to make any changes or corrections to your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer who will implement the changes. This will help us ensure our records are always up-to-date.</li>
<li>You always have the choice of whether you wish to receive information – such as e-mail updates – from Thalmic. If you do choose to opt out of communications respecting products and services provided by Thalmic, you may not obtain all the benefits we could otherwise provide, such as updates or warnings. Thalmic will not have any liability to you for your loss of those benefits or any negative effects respecting your use of Thalmic’s products or services.</li>
<li>A situation may arise where you desire to have all of your personal information that is contained in Thalmic’s records deleted or destroyed. If this is what you wish, please contact our Privacy Officer, who will take care of removing your personal information from all of Thalmic’s active records. However, there may be situations where we are obligated to retain one archival copy of your information to allow us to comply with laws or respond to legal processes, and there may be instances where we are unable to remove your specific information from our records for technical reasons. We will inform you of all such situations, and will only use your retained personal information to the limited extent necessary to comply with such laws or respond to legal processes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conditions-of-use-notices-and-revisions">Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h3>

You must obtain a valid, written Return Materials Authorization (RMA) from Thalmic as part of the warranty return process. Thalmic reserves the right to refuse or return any Thalmic Products sent back without an RMA.\r\n    3. If you notify Thalmic of any such material defects or non-conformance within such one (1) year period and obtain the applicable RMA, Thalmic will, at its option, repair or replace the Thalmic Products. If Thalmic is unable to repair or replace such Thalmic Products within a reasonable timeframe, Thalmic will refund you the amounts paid for such defective or non-conforming Thalmic Products. All shipment of such Thalmic Products is at your expense, unless Thalmic otherwise agrees in writing.\r\n    4. Thalmic may, at its option, use new or refurbished or used parts in good working condition to repair or replace any Thalmic Product. Any replacement Thalmic Product will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer, or for such minimum time period as required by the jurisdiction in which you reside.\r\n    5. The above warranty shall not apply to defects or non-conformities resulting from: (a) use of the Thalmic Product in a manner contrary to, or not in accordance with, the documentation (including these Product Terms), guidelines or instructions provided by Thalmic, (b) any modification, maintenance or repair of the Thalmic Products by anyone other than Thalmic, (c) normal wear and tear, (d) external causes such as, but not limited to, power failure or electrical power surges, or (e) your breach of these Product Terms. This warranty additionally does not cover Thalmic Products marked as \"sample\" or sold \"AS IS\".\r\n    6. Thalmic does not warrant that the operation of the Thalmic Product will be uninterrupted or error-free. Additionally, the foregoing warranty does not apply to any software provided to you, except to the extent that the Thalmic Product does not comply with this warranty solely due to firmware issues that are not excluded under this section. All Thalmic software is provided “AS IS”, and subject only to the license terms applicable to such software.\r\n    7. The warranty set forth in this section is the exclusive warranty made by Thalmic to you. Thalmic disclaims all other representations, warranties and conditions, whether express or implied, including but not limited to any express or implied representations, warranties or conditions of merchantability, merchantable quality, fitness for a particular purpose, durability, title, non-infringement, or any other warranty or condition arising by statute, custom or usage of trade related to the Thalmic Products provided hereunder. Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties and conditions. To the extent permitted by law, any implied warranties or conditions relating to the Thalmic Products and services to the extent that they cannot be excluded as set out above are limited to one (1) year from the date that the Thalmic Products are delivered to you.\r\n4. INDEMNITY\r\n    1. You shall defend, indemnify and hold Thalmic, its successors, assigns, officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from any and all claims, damages, judgments, settlements, losses or expenses, including but not limited to attorney’s fees and charges, and court and arbitration costs, arising out of or relating to these Product Terms (including without limitation (a) a claim of infringement of any intellectual property or proprietary right arising from your combination or use of the Thalmic Products with software, interfaces, or other materials that are not supplied or specifically authorized by Thalmic, (b) a claim respecting any injury, death or property damage in connection with your use or misuse of the Thalmic Products, (c) any third party claim arising from your unauthorized or improper use or modification of the Thalmic Products, and (d) any third party claim arising out of your material breach of these Product Terms). This indemnity obligation excludes any direct damages to the extent arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Thalmic.\r\n5. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY\r\n    1. In no event will Thalmic be liable under these Product Terms for any damages other than your direct damages to the extent arising from Thalmic’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, and in no event shall Thalmic’s aggregate liability exceed $200.00.\r\n    2. No claim may be brought against Thalmic, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, more than two years after the Thalmic Products were delivered.\r\n    3. The Thalmic Product is not intended for control of, or use with (whether direct or indirect), industrial, commercial, military or medical equipment, and is not intended for any use where failure or fault of the Thalmic Product could directly or indirectly cause risk or damage to life or property, or in any mission-critical application. Any such use is entirely at your discretion and risk, and shall void the warranty contained in these Product Terms. You will be solely responsible for (and Thalmic disclaims) any and all loss, liability, or damages resulting from such use.\r\n    4. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED DIRECT DAMAGES SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THALMIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE OR OPPORTUNITY, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN, AND WHETHER OR NOT THALMIC WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n6. SUPPORT\r\n    1. Thalmic shall not be obligated to provide any support or maintenance services for the Thalmic Products unless otherwise expressly agreed upon in writing by you and Thalmic. However, this provision does not relieve Thalmic of its warranty obligations described in the Warranty section of these Product Terms.\r\n7. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION\r\n    1. Thalmic may terminate these Product Terms upon written notice to you, and may also (if applicable) stop any Thalmic Products in transit to you and suspend the delivery of Thalmic Products to you without penalty, if: (a) you commit a material breach of these Product Terms and fail to remedy such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of such breach, or (b) you become involved in any legal proceeding concerning your solvency, have a receiver or administrator appointed of any of your assets, cease or threaten to cease operations, or otherwise have a serious and reasonable doubt arise respecting your solvency.\r\n    2. Upon termination of these Product Terms for your breach or insolvency: (a) all of Thalmic’s performance obligations hereunder shall immediately cease, (b) your license to use any software provided to you hereunder shall immediately cease, and you shall either return all such software to Thalmic or have an officer of your company certify that such software has been destroyed, and (c) any payments then due to Thalmic become immediately payable in full. The foregoing shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies that Thalmic may have in relation to your breach or insolvency.\r\n    3. Except as otherwise specified herein, neither party shall be entitled to terminate or cancel these Product Terms except with the prior written consent of the other party.\r\n8. FEEDBACK\r\n    1. We would appreciate receiving your feedback on the usability of the Thalmic Products, including feedback on any errors, problems, or other issues with the Thalmic Products. We will use your feedback to aid in resolving Thalmic Product issues and to improve our Thalmic Products, and may contact you to obtain further information. All personal information will be handled in accordance with our privacy policy available at thalmic.com/privacy.\r\n    2. You agree that Thalmic shall own all feedback, including without limitation: ideas, concepts, or changes to the Thalmic Product developed or identified in the course of these Product Terms or as the result of your use of the Thalmic Product, and all associated intellectual property rights therein (collectively the “Results”), and hereby assign to Thalmic all of your right, title and interest thereto. However, the foregoing shall not be deemed to transfer any ownership of applications or other materials that you develop to be compatible with the Thalmic Product, provided that such developments are independently developed by you without breaching these Product Terms.\r\n9. MISCELLANEOUS\r\n    1. These Product Terms constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all previous agreements relating to your usage of the Thalmic Product. These Product Terms may not be altered, amended, or modified except by a written instrument signed by the duly authorized representatives of both parties. If any one or more of the provisions of these Product Terms is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, any such provision shall be severable from these Product Terms. No waiver by either party of a breach or omission by the other party under these Product Terms shall be binding on the waiving party unless it is expressly made in writing and signed by the waiving party. These Product Terms, and all Thalmic Product requirements, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Province of Ontario. It is the express will of the parties that these Product Terms and all related documents be drawn up in English. C’est la volonté expresse des parties que la présente convention ainsi que les documents qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.\r\n10. CONTACT\r\n    1.

You may not purchase Thalmic Products for resale, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order, or to deny you any return rights, if we suspect you are doing so.</li>\n<li>Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, you shall not be entitled to change or cancel any order that has previously been accepted by Thalmic without the prior written agreement of Thalmic.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p>DELIVERY AND SHIPPING</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All orders are subject to acceptance by Thalmic, and any rejection of an order shall be made in Thalmic’s sole discretion, regardless of whether the order was confirmed through the Site.

Thalmic shall therefore not be liable in any way for any delay or damage arising from Thalmic’s failure to meet your delivery requirements or any delivery dates.</li>\n<li>All shipments shall be made FCA Thalmic’s facilities (Incoterms 2000). Risk of loss for products shall pass to you upon delivery to the carrier, and you are responsible for pursuing the carrier for any loss occurring in transit.</li>\n<li>You are responsible for examining all shipments promptly upon receipt. If you discover any shortages or incorrect products in the shipment, you must notify Thalmic immediately.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><p>PRICING AND PAYMENT</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All prices are in US dollars unless otherwise expressly stated in writing. Where you are making payment in a currency other than US dollars, the currency exchange rate that applies is the one in effect at the time your payment is processed, not the one that was in effect on the date that you placed your order. Thalmic reserves the right to change its standard prices without notice.</li>\n<li>Prices are exclusive of, and you will pay: (a) all applicable federal, state, provincial and local taxes (including all applicable sales, use, consumption, goods and service, value added, and withholding taxes), unless you have provided Thalmic with an appropriate tax exemption certificate or number, and (b) all fees and charges related to customs, duties and brokerage. Thalmic may charge sales tax for sales of Thalmic Products through the Site. Any sales tax charged will be indicated during the checkout process.</li>\n<li>As you are the importer of record in the destination country, you are responsible for all taxes, fees and charges in relation to importation, customs, duties and brokerage (collectively, “Import Fees”). You are also solely responsible for ensuring that the Thalmic Products can be lawfully imported, and for complying with all laws and regulations of the destination country related to importation, shipping and use of the Thalmic Products. Thalmic may, at its sole discretion, provide an estimate of some or all of the Import Fees that will be levied on the items in your order for shipment (“Import Fee Estimate”) during the purchase process. By placing your order, you agree to allow us to collect the Import Fees Estimate for the applicable items in your order. With respect to each item to which an Import Fee Estimate applies, you authorize us to designate a carrier to act as your agent with the relevant customs and tax authorities in the destination country, to clear your merchandise, and, if applicable, process and remit your actual Import Fees for such item (the &quot;Designated Carrier&quot;). This Import Fees Estimate amount remitted by you will be used, on your behalf, to reimburse the Designated Carriers for the Import Fees that they have paid on your behalf to the appropriate authorities of the destination country. The Import Fees Estimate may or may not include customs duties. If they do not include customs duties, you will be responsible for making arrangements with the customs authorities for payment of duties. The Import Fees Estimate may be more or less than the final actual amount of Import Fees due and payable. We have no control over the Import Fees and cannot always predict with 100% accuracy what the final actual amounts may be.

(“Thalmic”). By placing an order or making a purchase of a product (\"Thalmic Product\") from the Thalmic website (the \"Site\"), you agree to these terms of sale (\"Terms\") set out below, along with Thalmic’s Privacy Policy and Website Terms of Use. These Terms may be updated by Thalmic from time to time, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms each time you make a purchase from the Site.\r\n\r\nBY CLICKING ON THE BUTTON TO SUBMIT AN ORDER, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW, DO NOT CLICK THE BUTTON TO SUBMIT AN ORDER.\r\n\r\n1. ORDERING\r\n\r\n    1. These Terms shall apply to all orders for Thalmic Product placed by you through the Site, or as otherwise referenced in a written agreement between you and Thalmic. You acknowledge that the information contained on the Site may contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. The Site, all content available on the Site, and all related communications are provided on an \"AS IS\" basis. We make no representations or warranties as to the completeness, accuracy, adequacy or reliability of any information contained on the Site.\r\n    1. To place an order, you must:\r\n        - provide up-to-date, complete and accurate registration information as requested by us on the Site, which may include your first and last name, institution name, mailing address, phone number and email address;\r\n        - provide up-to-date, complete and accurate credit card information for a credit card that is valid and legally registered to you; and\r\n        - be at all times in compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and applicable law, including the requirement to be 18 years of age or older.\r\n    1. You specifically agree that Thalmic may rely on the accuracy of the information provided by you to Thalmic, and that Thalmic will have no liability whatsoever, whether to you or to any third party, for any claims or damages resulting from inaccurate information provided to Thalmic.\r\n    1. All Thalmic Products available through the Site are intended for end-user customers only. You may not purchase Thalmic Products for resale, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order, or to deny you any return rights, if we suspect you are doing so.\r\n    1. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, you shall not be entitled to change or cancel any order that has previously been accepted by Thalmic without the prior written agreement of Thalmic.\r\n\r\n1. DELIVERY AND SHIPPING\r\n\r\n    1. All orders are subject to acceptance by Thalmic, and any rejection of an order shall be made in Thalmic’s sole discretion, regardless of whether the order was confirmed through the Site. If you have been charged for an order that is subsequently rejected by Thalmic, Thalmic will refund the amount of that order to your credit card.\r\n    1. Thalmic will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your delivery requirements; however, delivery is subject to availability of resources at the time of order placement. Thalmic shall therefore not be liable in any way for any delay or damage arising from Thalmic’s failure to meet your delivery requirements or any delivery dates.\r\n    1. All shipments shall be made FCA Thalmic’s facilities (Incoterms 2000). Risk of loss for products shall pass to you upon delivery to the carrier, and you are responsible for pursuing the carrier for any loss occurring in transit.\r\n    1. You are responsible for examining all shipments promptly upon receipt. If you discover any shortages or incorrect products in the shipment, you must notify Thalmic immediately.\r\n\r\n1. PRICING AND PAYMENT\r\n\r\n    1. All prices are in US dollars unless otherwise expressly stated in writing. Where you are making payment in a currency other than US dollars, the currency exchange rate that applies is the one in effect at the time your payment is processed, not the one that was in effect on the date that you placed your order. Thalmic reserves the right to change its standard prices without notice.\r\n    1. Prices are exclusive of, and you will pay: (a) all applicable federal, state, provincial and local taxes (including all applicable sales, use, consumption, goods and service, value added, and withholding taxes), unless you have provided Thalmic with an appropriate tax exemption certificate or number, and (b) all fees and charges related to customs, duties and brokerage. Thalmic may charge sales tax for sales of Thalmic Products through the Site. Any sales tax charged will be indicated during the checkout process.\r\n    1. As you are the importer of record in the destination country, you are responsible for all taxes, fees and charges in relation to importation, customs, duties and brokerage (collectively, “Import Fees”). You are also solely responsible for ensuring that the Thalmic Products can be lawfully imported, and for complying with all laws and regulations of the destination country related to importation, shipping and use of the Thalmic Products. Thalmic may, at its sole discretion, provide an estimate of some or all of the Import Fees that will be levied on the items in your order for shipment (“Import Fee Estimate”) during the purchase process. By placing your order, you agree to allow us to collect the Import Fees Estimate for the applicable items in your order. With respect to each item to which an Import Fee Estimate applies, you authorize us to designate a carrier to act as your agent with the relevant customs and tax authorities in the destination country, to clear your merchandise, and, if applicable, process and remit your actual Import Fees for such item (the \"Designated Carrier\"). This Import Fees Estimate amount remitted by you will be used, on your behalf, to reimburse the Designated Carriers for the Import Fees that they have paid on your behalf to the appropriate authorities of the destination country. The Import Fees Estimate may or may not include customs duties. If they do not include customs duties, you will be responsible for making arrangements with the customs authorities for payment of duties. The Import Fees Estimate may be more or less than the final actual amount of Import Fees due and payable. We have no control over the Import Fees and cannot always predict with 100% accuracy what the final actual amounts may be. For greater certainty, you should contact your local customs office for further information on the Import Fees that may be applicable to your purchase. You agree and acknowledge that (a) the actual Import Fees may be more or less than the Import Fees Estimate and (b) you will NOT receive any refund in the case that the actual Import Fees are less than the Import Fees Estimate; however, if additional Import Fees are owing, you are solely responsible for remitting such Import Fees to the appropriate authorities.\r\n    1. Where your credit card is rejected for any reason, you will be responsible for any fees and charges associated with such rejection, as well as interest on the amount owing. Interest will be the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, commencing on the date that your credit card was rejected. Thalmic may, in its sole discretion, delay shipment of, or cancel, your Thalmic Product order where your credit card is rejected.\r\n\r\n1. RETURNS\r\n\r\n    1. A Thalmic Product purchased through the Site may be returned to Thalmic for a refund of Thalmic Product and applicable taxes, excluding shipping costs, within thirty (30) days of delivery. In order to be eligible for refund, returned Thalmic Products must not be damaged by misuse, abuse, or disassembly. Shipping of all returns is your responsibility and at your sole expense. Please consult Thalmic for details about its return procedures. You acknowledge that this 30 day return policy is considered in satisfaction of applicable statutory \"withdrawal rights\" or \"cooling off periods\", and you waive all such statutory rights.\r\n\r\n1. General Product Terms\r\n\r\n    1. These Terms cover order(s) for Thalmic Product(s) made using the Site. Your use of a Thalmic Product is subject to the General Product Terms available at [https://www.thalmic.com/general_product_terms](https://www.thalmic.com/general_product_terms). By using a Thalmic Product (ordered through the Site or otherwise), you agree to the General Product Terms.\r\n\r\n1. Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n    1.

These Terms may not be altered, amended, or modified except by a written instrument signed by the duly authorized representatives of both parties. If any one or more of the provisions of these Terms is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, any such provision shall be severable from these Terms.
