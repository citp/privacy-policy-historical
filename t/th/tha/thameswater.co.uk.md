  * information about your credit history with other credit providers which we obtain from credit reference agencies; 
  * some of the information we collect about you may include special category data; if you have provided us with details of your health, we will use that information where you need to be treated as a Vulnerable or Priority Customer for water needs.


  * If you volunteer other relevant information about your circumstances which affect your ability to pay your bills, we will take account of those details;
  * Information about your use of our services, including information about your water usage which we collect from meters. 



#### Smart Metering - Why do we use smart meters?

Managing water supplies will only get more difficult as our population grows and our climate changes.

As a result, we need to modernise the way we manage supplies by fitting meters across our region, helping to protect supplies for future generations.

Smart meters send us regular meter reads (hourly/daily/monthly), so we can:

  * give you frequent information so that you can be in control of your water use and your bill; 
  * let you know if you have a leak on your external pipe; 
  * give you accurate bills based on what you have used; 
  * help you with any queries quickly; 
  * measure the amount of water that is used by our customers so we can maintain our network more efficiently; and, 
  * identify leaks on our network and act quickly to fix them.

#### Customer Surveys

We are committed to improving the service we provide to our customers. Essential to this is the need to understand, directly from our customers, how well we are currently doing. We use this information to create and monitor change. Gathering this feedback also provides us with an opportunity to reconnect with our customers and ‘put things right’ should they be less than happy with our service.

We use a variety of methods to gather feedback from our customers. We may do this ourselves, but equally we also rely on a small number of partner organisations. We have Data Sharing Agreements in place with these agencies and all conform to Market Research Society Codes of Conduct. The following agencies undertake the most work for us:

  * **Rant & Rave** carry out the bulk of our customer surveys. You may get a text, email or landline voicemail, asking a number of different questions, including your satisfaction with the service and whether you would recommend Thames Water. This will most often happen after interactions on the phone, website or after a visit from one of our technicians or contractors. Occasionally, and in particular during service failures, we may use Rant & Rave to proactively keep you updated; and to help us gather information to best service your needs in the moment. If you are dissatisfied with our service, we may look to reconnect with you to put things right. 
  * **BMG (Bostock Marketing Group)** work on behalf of our Regulator (Ofwat) and ourselves. Every three months, Ofwat commissions BMG to phone a number of our customers who have recently made contact with us to ask them for their view on the service we provided. They may also ask some demographic questions to enable Ofwat to understand whether we are treating all our customers fairly. BMG also carry out the same survey on behalf of Thames Water, however this is done on a weekly basis. 
  * **Allto Consulting** also work on behalf of our Regulator. Ofwat are in the process of piloting a new way of measuring the service Water companies provide. Allto Consulting may contact our customers through a number of different ways, including telephone, text, email and online. Surveys will be conducted on any customers within the Thames Water area, regardless of whether they have made contact with the water company. 
  * **Populus** are employed by us to conduct quarterly surveys on customers within our area (contactors and non-contactors). They recruit and utilise their own online panel of customers, asking them specifically about whether they would recommend Thames Water and further questions to understand reasoning behind their scores. They also undertake various other forms of research on our behalf, including focus groups, online surveys and panels, telephone, face-to-face and in the street surveying 
  * Other companies that we partner with include: **BritainThinks, Verve, eftec** and **Community Research**. All companies undertake various forms of research on our behalf, including focus groups, online surveys and panels, telephone, face-to-face and in the street surveying. 



Customers may opt out or stop any service improvement surveying at any point in time – whether that’s stopping any further surveys or withdrawing partway through the activity. Other than the Rant & Rave survey, customers will always be asked whether they wish to remain anonymous to Thames Water.

Customer data generated through these routes will only be used for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the service we provide, how we can improve it and with the intention of helping customers during incidents if required. (This is not used for any Marketing activity).
