                <h2>General Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy tells you how we collect information when you visit That Daily Deal, or if you purchase a product from us.</p>
                <p>At That Daily Deal (AKA TDD), we understand the importance of your personal information. We ensure that we comply with this obligation, to you (our valued customers).</p>
                <p>When you submit information to That Daily Deal by creating an account, purchasing one of our products, or by sending us an email, we collect that information and use it for the purposes of providing you with information or advice about our goods and/or services, and for processing an order by you for our goods and/or services. Specifically, we require your name, street address, email address, phone number and method of payment details in order to complete an order for said goods and/or services.</p>
                <p>We shall only disclose your personal information to third parties where the disclosure is necessary and directly related to the purposes set out above - such as our financial institution to process your order. <strong>We shall not give our customer lists to third parties for promotions independent of That Daily Deal. You do not have to provide us with the information requested; however, we will be unable to process your order should you be unwilling to do so.</strong></p>
                <p>That Daily Deal relies on word-of-mouth of customers and friends to let it be known about our total awesomeness. To keep you up-to-date on new products and special deals/promotions, we do send occasional emails about promotions and newly listed items. In accordance with the CAN-SPAM Act 2003, we shall only send you emails with your prior consent and shall be happy to remove you from our mailing list should you no longer wish to receive our promotional information. To remove yourself, please go <a href="http://thatdailydeal.com/newsletter.php?unsubscribe=1">here</a> and enter in your email address.</p>
