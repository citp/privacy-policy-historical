A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to disable cookies or to notify you when you receive a cookie and provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features on our Website.

(b) Information collected via cookies may be used by us and third party vendors to:

**3.5 Use of Google Analytics**

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service operated by Google Inc. (“Google“). Google Analytics uses cookies (text files) which are sorted on your computer and which allow for analysis of your visits to be conducted. Information concerning your visit produced through cookies (including IP address) will be transferred to and stored on a server in the USA operated by Google. Google will analyse this information to produce a report for the operator on website usage and online usage of associated services. Google may also transfer this information to third parties either where this is required by law or where third parties are contracted by Google to process data. Google will not allow your IP address to be linked to any other personal data. You can prevent cookies being installed on your computer by changing your browser settings; however, if you choose to do this, your visit to our website and use of some functionality may be impaired. By using this website you are deemed to have expressly consented to the use and processing of your data collected and processed at any time. This withdrawal concerns consent to future activities. Please be advised that to avoid personal data being collected through IP addresses, we use Google Analytics ad-on “anonymized“. As a result a shortened (or anonymous) IP address is sent to Google.
