We will also collect some of your sensitive personal information, viz: your bank account details or your credit or debit card details. We use this sensitive personal information only to secure our payment for the Orders that you have placed with us.

  * Your credit card/bank statement would not show our name: Even your credit card / bank account would not show a transaction with the name of our company. Thatspersonal.com would not appear anywhere.
  * The merchant name on the card/bank statement will either show our payments processing partner name or it will show our parent companies name

  * Your shipping address: This is used to ship your order. You can change it for every order and we will not send anything else to this address except your order itself.
  * Your phone number: This is used only for purposes of helping the courier delivery person track you. The concealed packing of the orders ensures that the courier delivery person does not get to know anything about your order or you. Your phone number may also be used to confirm your orders and send you shipment tracking codes.
  * Your credit card information: Your CC/bank account information is used only to process the transaction.
  * Your email address: We will not send you e-mails if you request us not to. As a default, we assume your consent to send you e-mails for purposes of:


  1. E-mailing you copy of the order
  2. E-mailing you the shipping confirmation
  3. E-mailing you a short customer satisfaction survey
  4. E-mailing you ‘Reminders’ for products you opt to be reminded for



  You’re billing address: This is required ONLY for purposes of verification of your credit card. Thatspersonal.com will not send anything to your billing address.

  * Every website inevitably collects information. However, we have a comprehensive information gathering policy to maintain your privacy.
  * For Visitors (people who look into our store or visit us, but do not register with us) - When you visit thatspersonal.com, we know that someone is visiting us but we do NOT know that it is you. We ONLY count the number of visitors and track which pages/products are of greater interest to visitors.

  1. We keep a record of your personal information but it is covered by our Privacy Policy and is held in strictest confidence.
  2. You have the right to know what information we have collected about you. You also have the right to change this information. If you would like to contact us about changing some aspect of the information we have for you, please write to us at admin@thatspersonal.com
  3. In order to make changes to your information you will be required to first prove your identity to us. This prevents other individuals from accessing your files.

**Legal issues**

  * Just in case, a transaction is involved in a legal dispute (usually credit card fraud); information might be requested from us in form of a witness summons (legal demand for information or appearance). In such cases, we might be required to furnish requisite information. In case this occurs, our policy is to first contact the customer (through preferred medium chosen by the customer) to inform them of our legal obligations.
  * These issues are not common and generally happen in case of credit card frauds. Hence, such information sharing would help in protecting your account and business with us.

  * Our site may have links from advertisers and we take NO responsibility of consequences after being re-directed to their websites.



**Merger, Acquisition and Termination of Service**

If we merge with, or are acquired by another company, the resulting combined company will use the Personal Information and / or any sensitive personal information you have provided as described in this policy.
