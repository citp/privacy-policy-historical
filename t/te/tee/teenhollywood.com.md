We do not require our members to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in activities on our sites.

## Cookies

Cookies are used to track information including personally identifiable information. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser to reject or prompt before receiving cookies.

Our privacy policy does not cover 3rd party advertiser use of cookies on our site as we have no control over their use of data.

## Polls and Surveys

When you participate in polls or surveys on our sites, your anonymity is maintained at all times. If survey results are provided to outside parties, all personally identifiable information is removed and data is reported only in aggregate.

## Aggregate and Summary Information
