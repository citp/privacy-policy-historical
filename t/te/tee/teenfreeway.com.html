<p class="style2">Our goal in collecting personal information from you upon registration is to
provide you, the user, with the best experience possible by targeting site
content and advertisements to our audience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your information is
stored in our database and not released to any outside parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
will not sell, rent, or distribute any of the registration information that you
provide to us without your consent.

        <p class="style2">

But please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily give out any personally
identifying information to any merchant listed on our site, that this
information can be collected and used by others.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should always
check the privacy policies of each merchant featured on
TeenFreeway.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally identifying information includes your
name, your home or other physical address, e-mail address, telephone number or
any information that makes you identifiable.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you post any of this
personally identifying information in online areas that are accessible to the
public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.&nbsp;

        <p class="style2">

TeenFreeway is by definition for teenagers (i.e. 13 and older) -- and older
folks who are teenagers at heart!&nbsp; You must be 13 or older to participate
in any TeenFreeway promotions.&nbsp; For those sites for which TeenFreeway is a
conduit, again, you must read the privacy guidelines of that site which may
differ materially from those of TeenFreeway.
        </p><p class="style2">The United States Children's Online
        Privacy Protection Act went into effect on April 21st, 2000. In order to
        comply with that law, TeenFreeway will not knowingly process any data
        that was submitted to us by a visitor who is under 13 years of age.&nbsp;
        TeenFreeway is all about providing the best freebies on the web for
        teenagers.</p>
