Teespring does not store this information and is only used for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<h3>Facebook Connect or Open ID</h3>

<h3>Information Sharing</h3>		
<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>If you participate in a white-labeled enterprise campaign (identified by the enterprise having their logo in the top left of the campaign, as opposed to the Teespring logo) we may share your name, email address and order breakdown of size and quantity with the enterprise customers for the purposes of continued contact. This information is encrypted on the Teespring database and is only decrypted to send to the enterprise client securely. After this has been complete, the plain-text data is purged from the Teespring server. To opt out of this marketing, please contact the white-labeled enterprise customer.</p>
<p>We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>
<ol>
	<li>As required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
	<li>When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request</li>
	<li>If Teespring is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information</li>

<h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>		
<p>We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information.

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.

When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also encrypt customer information in our database so that customers name and address is never stored in plain text. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Please <a href="http://teespring.com/contact">contact us</a>, if you have any questions about security on our Web site.</p>

If you choose to use a third party payment option, such as PayPal, to pay for your order, its privacy policy and security practices will apply to your information. We encourage you to read that privacy policy before providing your information.</p>
