# Privacy Policy | Teen Ink

At _Teen Ink_ , we respect your privacy. We do collect information from you, but it is _Teen Ink's_ policy and priority to ensure that all personal information remains private and secure.

To protect your privacy, Teen Ink:

  * Provides a privacy notice and/or a link to this Privacy Statement on all pages that ask for personal information;
  * Will not release personal identifying information about you without first obtaining consent; and
  * Will not knowingly collect or use personal identifying information from children younger than 13.



When you visit the _Teen Ink_ website, we may collect some basic information about your computer, including:

  * IP address (your computer's unique signature)
  * Operating system (e.g., Windows 95)
  * Browser software (e.g., Netscape, Microsoft Internet Explorer)
  * Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL)
  * Geographic location (e.g., Philadelphia, PA.)



The information we collect reflects the population as a whole rather than focusing on individuals, and we use it to help us better understand the people who visit _Teen Ink_. This information helps us identify the most popular areas on Teen Ink's website and determine the effectiveness of _Teen Ink's_ promotional activities. In addition, we may disclose some of this general information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and clicked on their advertisements.

For the same purposes, we may use cookies - small text files placed on your computer's hard drive - to help us determine the type of content and sites to which you link, the length of time that you spend at any particular site and the _Teen Ink_ services you use. We use cookies to personalize _Teen Ink's_ members' and visitors' experiences. Without cookies, it would be difficult for us to provide any personalized service or to fully understand _Teen Ink_ readers needs. Cookies also tell us which advertising you have seen on the Teen Ink site, thereby allowing us to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising information.

The cookies used in connection with certain pages may allow _Teen Ink_ to compile demographic data (which is not identifiable to a specific individual) about visitors to _Teen Ink_.

We do collect the e-mail addresses of people who communicate with us via e-mail to respond to these communications and to send future correspondence. We may archive messages for quality assurance purposes. In cases where _Teen Ink_ may use a third-party vendor to provide a service (such as chat), feedback or questions directed to _Teen Ink_ about that service may be forwarded to the vendor for a direct response to a reader.

For your protection, some of Teen Ink's personnel have access to _Teen Ink's_ bulletin boards, chat rooms and forums to help us maintain a safe and collaborative environment online. Currently, we do not archive chat dialogs, screen names or forum postings. We also do not perform any analysis of chat room discussions. We encourage you not to give personal information or passwords to anyone on the bulletin board, in the chat rooms or forums. When you disclose your personal information, it may be collected and used by others to send you unsolicited e-mail. If you encounter any _Teen Ink_ user who is improperly collecting or using information, please contact _Teen Ink_.

When you join, enter contests or sign up for other services at _Teen Ink_ , we collect personal identifying information from you, which may include the following:

  * First and last name;
  * Home or other physical address;
  * E-mail address;
  * Phone number;
  * Any other information that identifies you as a specific individual;
  * Any other information that, when tied to the above information, may identify you as a specific individual.
  * Name of your school and name of your teacher
  * Your age and date of birth



We collect this information on pages where you can submit your work to _Teen Ink_ for publishing consideration or register to join _Teen Ink_ services and at other locations where you can sign up for sweepstakes and contests. We give notice at each location that asks for personal information, and such information will be used only for the purposes stated at the location of the collection and/or within this Privacy Statement.

We use information about _Teen Ink_ members and visitors for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve _Teen Ink's_ services. Such uses include data transmission, customer surveys conducted by _Teen Ink_ or third parties, e-mail or chat services and other future services. We reserve the right to use third parties to provide these services. These third parties may receive certain personal identifying information about you in order for them to perform their services.

We send member account passwords only to the e-mail address given during the registration process. All registrants receive e-mail confirming their Registration. NEVER GIVE YOUR PASSWORD TO ANYONE. If someone claiming to represent _Teen Ink_ in an e-mail or chat room asks for your _Teen Ink_ password, DO NOT RESPOND. The only time we ask for your password is when you need to access to the _Teen Ink_ system.

_Teen Ink_ cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use _Teen Ink_ services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to release information about members who we believe are in violation of _Teen Ink's_ content guidelines, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful. We save your personal information indefinitely since we may need to contact you in the event we want your permission to publish your work in the future. If you would like us to remove you from our data base, please contact us at [administrator@TeenInk.com](mailto:administrator@TeenInk.com). We maintain information on members who have been removed for violating _Teen Ink's_ content guidelines in order to identify repeat offenders. From time to time, we may contact members to inform them of improvements or enhancements to _Teen Ink_ services.

_Teen Ink_ will use your credit card number in order to provide you with the subscription or goods or services that you request. It may also be used for other purposes stated at the time of collection, which may require disclosure of your credit card number and other personal identifying information about you to third parties. Information collected by _Teen Ink_ is securely stored on _Teen Ink's_ computers, which are called servers. Credit card transactions take place solely on servers that offer a higher level of security.

The transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information in order to verify the credit card number and process the transaction. Only authorized _Teen Ink_ employees have access to this information, in a manner consistent with industry standards. Third-party vendors may also sell products and services on _Teen Ink_ , and their policies may differ from those of _Teen Ink_.

**6\. Policies for Individuals Under 13**

_Teen Ink_ encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites. _Teen Ink_ encourages parents and guardians to advise their children not to talk to strangers, and to teach children not to give out their names or other personal information. Parents and guardians should also teach their children never to fill out online registration forms without the parent's or guardian's knowledge and consent. No information should be submitted to or posted at the _Teen Ink_ web sites by children without the consent of their parent or guardian. In addition, when a child registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail about Registration and providing instructions on how the parent or guardian can delete the Registration if so desired.

Although children are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial Registration process. _Teen Ink_ does not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children under age 13 without obtaining express parental consent. Express parental consent means that _Teen Ink_ obtains affirmative agreement from a parent or legal guardian that the child may divulge personal information by transmitting a signed statement by postal mail or fax.

All general information collected from children is used only for statistical analysis, editorial participation, feedback and those purposes described above and in the registration process. We do not give children's personal information to third parties, regardless of whether or not the children choose to allow us to disseminate their personal information for promotional opportunities.

Note: _Teen Ink_ defines "children" as minors younger than age 13.

When you join _Teen Ink_ , you have the option of signing up to receive information from _Teen Ink's_ third party sponsors. _Teen Ink_ may also hosts promotions and sweepstakes that may be sponsored and administered by outside parties. The fact that _Teen Ink_ merchandise may be given away as prizes does not mean that _Teen Ink_ is the sponsor. We require that outside parties conducting promotions and sweepstakes on _Teen Ink_ site clearly identify who is conducting the promotion and state their practices concerning the use of personal identifying information. We will post privacy information in the rules and/or login area for the promotions and sweepstakes that we host. To the extent that the privacy information relating to the promotion or sweepstakes conflicts with _Teen Ink's_ Privacy Statement, the specific privacy information regarding the promotion or sweepstakes will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes.

Third parties that receive information about you from _Teen Ink_ at your request are obligated to:



  1. Clearly indicate the sender of the e-mail message; and
  2. Provide you with a method of opting out from receiving future communications.




If you receive e-mail from a third party stating that is associated with _Teen Ink_ , yet you do not want to receive promotional materials from _Teen Ink_ or its sponsors, please follow the third party's removal procedures. If this procedure is not successful, please contact us at [editor@TeenInk.com](mailto:editor@TeenInk.com).

We do not control the actions of _Teen Ink's_ members and visitors. If you disclose personal information on a bulletin board, in a chat room, forum or anywhere else on the site, it may be collected and used by others. Additionally, be aware that when you click on ad banners, they may lead you to other sites not operated by _Teen Ink_. These outside parties may have different privacy policies from ours. _Teen Ink_ does not assume any responsibility for actions of third parties.

This privacy policy applies to the information Teen Ink collects about you as a user of Teen Ink site and services. Some of these services may provide you with additional information and choices about your privacy, which you should review.

This policy does not apply to information about you collected by third party websites and offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from Teen Ink. The information collected or received by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.
