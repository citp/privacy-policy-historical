**PRIVACY STATEMENT**

TeenGrowth knows your privacy is important and believes your personal information should be kept confidential. To demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, TeenGrowth follows to the requirements of the Children Protection and Privacy Act (COPPA) regarding the collection and use of identifiable personal information for children 13 years of age and younger.

**Information TeenGrowth Collects**

_Personal Information_  
TeenGrowth does not require that you register personal information such as full names, postal addresses or telephone numbers to access the educational resources on the site. However, TeenGrowth does collect limited information when you access certain areas of the site. These areas include asking medical questions of our Medical Advisory Board (Ask Us) and requesting to receive the weekly newsletter. The information collected is to help us better understand your needs and is never given or sold to third parties. 

Your e-mail address may be used in the "Ask Us" area to contact you directly regarding the question you submitted to our Medical Advisory Board. However, this is only done if you give us permission when you submit the question or if the Advisory Board feels it's in your best interest to contact you, such as in cases of questions related to severe depression or suicide. 

_Non-Personal Information_  
TeenGrowth uses "cookies" to track your activity on the site. This allows us to know which pages you visited, how long you spent on each page, which browser you used to visit the site, the domain name of your Internet provider and how much time you spent on TeenGrowth. The cookies do not identify your personal information such as your name or e-mail address. 

_Surveys_  
From time to time, TeenGrowth may invite you to complete a survey about your likes and dislikes regarding a variety of topics, including products, trends and habits. The purpose of the surveys is to learn about the interests and trends of the teenage market. Any personally identifiable information supplied by you is only for internal use and will not be shared or sold to third parties.
