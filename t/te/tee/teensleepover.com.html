We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm
commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices with respect
to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal
information provided by visitors to our Web site. By using this site, you
signify your assent to our privacy practices and the terms and conditions of
our Web site. If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not use this site.

<dt>What type information is collected?</dt>
<dd>
We only collect personal information from visitors to our Web site when they
voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration form or electing
to use one of our services. We may require visitors to provide us with
information including, but not limited to, their name, physical address, email
address, birth date, username, password, and on occasion a unique identifier.
</dd>
<dd>
When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information may be
collected from them including, but not limited to, their browser type (e.g.,
Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh),
IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed the site (e.g.,
google.com). In addition, we may collect information about visitors' browsing
behavior, such as the date and time they visit the Web site, the areas or
pages of our Web site that they visit, the amount of time spent viewing the
site, the number of times the visitor returns to the site, and click-stream
data. We use transparent tracking pixels to determine the number of Web site
visitors that have been sent to us through our affiliate network. We do not
track any information about visitors once they leave our site. We may use
cookies (small text files that are stored on visitors computers when they
access our Web site) to collect this information. Information collected
through cookies may be combined with visitors' personal information. We may
also allow unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies
to visitors of our Web site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but
in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our Web site. The
"help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a
browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform a user when
they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from their hard drives.

</dd>
<dt>In what way do we use your personal and non-personal information?</dt>
<dd>
Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide visitors with the
most personalized Web experience possible and our advertisers with an
efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about our
visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and
provide better services. We may use information collected from visitors to our
Web site for any of the following purposes: (1) to send visitors information
and promotional materials about our company, (2) to send visitors information
and promotional materials from our marketing partners and third parties (such
as advertisers on our Web site), (3) to deliver targeted display
advertisements and offers by email (by matching criteria provided by our
advertisers with information collected from our visitors), (4) to contact
visitors to our Web site when necessary, (5) to allow one-click purchases or
access to proprietary content by pre-populating fields, within registration or
other transaction screens, with a visitor's name, billing address, and email
(among other things), as provided by that visitor, (6) to help diagnose 
problems with our server, (7) to administer our Web site, (8) to conduct 
internal reviews of our site (e.g., to determine the number of
visitors to the site), (9) to help us better understand visitors' use of our
site, and (10) to protect the security or integrity of our site.  Non-personal
information will be used for purposes of conducting internal reviews of the
site, monitoring the site, and providing a greater online experience for our
visitors.

areas) to register and become a member of our site.

In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock sale, bankruptcy, or
other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality), any of our assets may be
transferred to a third party, including personal information collected from
visitors to our Web site.
