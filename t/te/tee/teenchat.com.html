During       registration, Wishbone asks only for your email address.  Later, when you want to reveal more of yourself in order to take advantage of our many services (i.e. our Matchmaking service requires detailed information about your likes, dislikes, and general location) we will store that information also.       The more       information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are       able to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer       anonymous to Wishbone - you are given a Wishbone ID and are able to take full       advantage of Wishbone's many offerings.       </p><p>In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information at       other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes,       contest or promotion sponsored by Wishbone and/or our many partners; when       you make a purchase using Wishbone Shopping; when you post a Wishbone Classified ad;       when you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem       with one of our sites or services. If you contact Wishbone we may keep a       record of that correspondence. Wishbone also occasionally asks users to       complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever Wishbone       collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this       Privacy Policy on that page.       </p><p>      </p><hr noshade="" size="0">      <br><b><a name="cookies">What are cookies and how does Wishbone use       them?</a></b>       <p>As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized       services, Wishbone uses <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/cookie.htm" target="_top">cookies</a> to store and sometimes track information about       you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from       a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on Wishbone       where you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you       accept cookies. (See <a href="#choice">"What are my choices       regarding collection, use and distribution of my information?"</a> for       more information on cookies.)       </p><p>Generally, we use cookies to:       </p><p>(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information       (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more       personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In"       and is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services.       </p><p>(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing Wishbone is given       a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat       usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to       help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.       </p><p>(3) Assist merchants in Wishbone Stores to track visits to and business       at their stores, and to process the items in your shopping basket. This       information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or       "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen in each       merchant's store.       </p><p>(4) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our       promotions, sweepstakes and contests. When a Wishbone-hosted promotion uses       cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's       progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries,       submissions, and status in prize drawings.       </p><p>(5) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of Wishbone's network       of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the       aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are       similar or different from one another so that we can make each new       experience on Wishbone a better one. We may use this information to better       personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users       will see on our sites.       </p><p>Advertising networks that serve ads onto Wishbone may also use their own       cookies.       </p><p>Wishbone also collects <a href="http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html">IP addresses</a>       for system administration and to report aggregate information to our       advertisers. In addition, Wishbone Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing       mail message headers.       </p><p>      </p><hr size="0">      <br><b><a name="how">How does Wishbone use my information?</a></b>       <p>Wishbone's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide       you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This       includes personalization services, interactive communications, online       shopping and many other types of services, most of which are completely       free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display       advertisements. By knowing a little about you, Wishbone is able to deliver       more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to       you.       </p><p>In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, Wishbone plays the       middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of       audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Wishbone       takes the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In       this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account       information. Only Wishbone has access to individuals' accounts. This kind of       advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional       email through Wishbone Delivers. You will only receive special offers via       email from Wishbone if you have indicated in your account preferences that       you would like to receive them. You can change your account preferences at       any time.       </p><p>Wishbone does research on our users' demographics, interests, and       behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, during       a promotion, from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to       better understand and serve our users. This research is compiled and       analyzed on an aggregated basis. Wishbone may share this aggregated data       with advertisers or business partners.       </p><p>      </p><hr size="0">      <br><b><a name="who">Who is collecting information?</a></b>       <p>When you are on a Wishbone site and are asked for personal information,       you are sharing that information with Wishbone alone, unless it is       specifically stated otherwise. For example, some Wishbone services,       are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order       to provide this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share       your personal information with our partner company. If data is being       collected and/or maintained by any company other than Wishbone, you will be       notified prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do       not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer       by not using that particular service.       </p><p>Promotions that run on Wishbone may be sponsored by companies other than       Wishbone or may be cosponsored by Wishbone and another company. Some or all       data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data       will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection       or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you       don't want your data to be shared. Currently, most Wishbone promotions are       limited to US or North American residents.       </p><p>Please be aware that Wishbone Internet access partners, advertisers, and       web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable       information about you.

Please see the       Terms of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services       for more detailed information about how your personal information may be       shared. The following describes some of the ways that your information may       be disclosed.       </p><p><u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>: Wishbone may disclose your       personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is       specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to       transferring the data. Details of shared use can be found in specific       Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions rules.       Some or all data collected during a Wishbone promotion may be shared with a       sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, we will       tell you before we collect or transfer the data.       </p><p>Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information       from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give Wishbone permission       to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill       your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared.       If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified       prior to the transfer.       </p><p><u>Wishbone Stores &amp; Shopping</u>: If you make a purchase from a       store hosted by Wishbone Store, or a merchant in Wishbone Shopping, the       information obtained during your visit to those stores, and the       information you give such as your credit card number and contact       information, is provided to the merchants. This is to enable transactions       to take place.       </p><p>Merchants listed in Wishbone Shopping or site or in Wishbone Stores have       separate privacy and data collection practices. Wishbone has no       responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more       information regarding the merchant, their store, and their privacy       policies, return to that store's home page and click on their       <b>Information</b> link.       </p><p><u>Wishbone Auctions</u>: On the Wishbone Auctions site, we currently       provide the information necessary to facilitate the auction transaction       between the buyer and the seller.       </p><p>From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive       materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt-in to receive       information from these third parties, Wishbone will (with your permission)       share your name and email address with them .       </p><p><u>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate</u>: Under       confidentiality agreements, Wishbone may match user information with third       party data. Also, Wishbone discloses aggregated user statistics (for       example, 45% of our users are female) in order to describe our services to       current and prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties,       and for other lawful purposes.       </p><p><u>Other:</u> Wishbone may also disclose account information in special       cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is       necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who       may be violating Wishbone's Terms of Service or may be causing injury to or       interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Wishbone's       rights or property, other Wishbone users, or anyone else that could be       harmed by such activities. Wishbone may disclose or access account       information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for       administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain,       service, and improve our products and services.       </p><p>      </p><hr size="0">      <br><b><a name="choice">What are my choices regarding collection, use, and       distribution of my information?</a></b>       <p>Wishbone may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products       and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are       interested in receiving offers or information from Wishbone and our       partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and       services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only Wishbone (or agents       working on behalf of Wishbone and under confidentiality agreements) will       send you these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not       object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings,       simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time       you can easily edit your account to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You will       need your user name and password in order to access your account.      </p><p>On some types of Wishbone promotions, we will ask for your email address       in order to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize       drawings. When you participate in these types of promotions, you       automatically receive promotion-related email, unless you choose the       no-email option that some promotions offer. Occasionally these       promotion-related email messages may include targeted advertisements.       </p><p>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your       browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be       notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to       reject all cookies you will be unable to use those Wishbone services that       require registration in order to participate. These services include (but       are not limited to): Wishbone Mail, My Wishbone, Calendar, Chat, Message       Boards, and creating a portfolio in Wishbone Finance. You can still use       Wishbone Shopping and Wishbone Auctions and many other Wishbone sites even if       you do not accept cookies.       </p><p>Wishbone does not sell or rent user information to anyone. We will notify       you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared       with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting       the transfer. If you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can       choose not to use a particular service or not to participate in certain       promotions or contests.       </p><p>      </p><hr size="0">      <br><b><a name="update">What is Wishbone's policy on allowing me to update,       correct, or delete my personally identifiable information?</a></b>       <p>You may edit your account information and your public       profile at       any time by using your username and password.       </p><p>Your Wishbone account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will       result in not being able to access any members-only area of the Wishbone       network, including your Wishbone Mail account (if you have one).
