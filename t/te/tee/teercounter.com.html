The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -  See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br></div><div class="innerText"><br><strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></div><div class="innerText">Users can visit our site anonymously</div><div class="innerText">Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</div><div class="innerText">Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</div><div class="innerText"><br>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</div><div class="innerText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> On our Privacy Policy Page</div><div class="innerText">Users are able to change their personal information:</div><div class="innerText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>•</strong> By logging in to their account</div><div class="innerText"><br><strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong></div><div class="innerText">We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. </div><div class="innerText"><br><strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong></div><div class="innerText">It's also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</div><span id="coppAct"></span><br><div class="blueText"><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></div><br><div class="innerText">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
