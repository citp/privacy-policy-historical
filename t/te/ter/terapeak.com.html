When you visit the Website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser.</p>

<h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
<h3>User Accounts</h3>
<p>We create user accounts to tailor the information displayed to each individual user and as applicable to the users.</p>
<h3>Profiles</h3>
<p>We create a profile of our users that details their viewing preferences. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to the Websites or use of the Products and Services and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share user profiles with third parties.</p>
<h3>Tracking</h3>
<p>We use the information obtained through the tracking of our users activities to administer the Websites and Products and Services and generate statistics and aggregate reports, for internal use only, on our users demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand the users and our client base.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>We use cookies on certain pages of the Websites to help analyze the Website flow, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety. We offer certain features that are available through the use of a cookie. We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies may also be used in the future to help us provide information that is targeted to your interests.</p>
<p>You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Website features or Products and Services may not function properly without cookies.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners may also use cookies on the Websites, for example a tracking utility company.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of tracking technologies by any third parties.</p>
<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<p>We may post testimonials that include personal information on the Websites.</p>
<h3>Blogs/Discussion Forums</h3>
<p>Any unsolicited personal information you submit to the blogs or discussion forum on the Websites can be read, collected, or used by other users of the blog, and may be used by such other users to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for any personal information you choose to submit in the blogs or discussion forums.</p>
<h3>Transfers</h3>
<p>We do not sell, rent or distribute any personal information regarding any user to any third party, nor do we disclose lists of users to any third party except as described in this Privacy Policy (see Matching and Business Transitions).</p>
<h3>Matching</h3>
<p>We license data sets that contain emails, names and physical addresses to third parties who use such personal information solely to match such licensed data sets with their own data sets. Agreements with such third parties restrict them from any other use of such personal information unless they obtain your consent to such other use.</p>
<h3>Spamming/Unsolicited Communications</h3>
<p>We do not solicit or facilitate the solicitation by any third party of any users as a result of their affiliation or status as a member or user of a specific data set. We do not spam or otherwise send unsolicited communications to users that are not reasonably related to the Websites and/or the Products and Services.</p>

<p>We offer a periodic newsletter, which is provided free to subscribers who provide their name and email address.</p>
<p>From time to time we conduct surveys and contests, participation in which may require users to provide personal information.</p>
<h2>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h2>

<h3>Sharing Of Personal Information With Third Parties</h3>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personal information with third parties who are not service providers.</p>
<h3>Business Transitions</h3>

We will post a prominent notice of any such transition on the Websites for at least 30 days prior to such a business transition and if a user’s personal information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection such a user will be given a choice consistent with our Notification of Changes section.</p>
