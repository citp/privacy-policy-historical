<p>Some of our business partners may use cookies and Web beacons on our site, for example a tracking utility company. However, we have no access to or control over these tracking technologies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies or Web beacons for advertising and our internal tracking purposes.</p>
<p>We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) information and provide information in a non-personally identifiable manner to other third party marketing partners.</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>Like most standard Website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information such as your email address.</p>
<h3>Communications from the Site</h3>
<h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3>
<p>We send all new members a welcoming email. Established members will only receive information on products, services, special deals, in a once monthly newsletter.

<p>On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account. We reply via email or phone, in accordance to the users wishes.</p>
<h3>Sharing</h3>
<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p>With the exception of user obligations arising from existing relationships with eBay and use of eBay services that may result in shared user information, and although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Website.</p>
<h3>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3>
<p>We do not share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.</p>
<h3>Third Party Advertisers</h3>
<p>We do not share Website usage information about users with third party advertisers.</p>
<h3>Sharing of Personal Information with Third Parties</h3>

The PayPal or Beanstream payment window appears on the Terapeak.com Website. Please review their privacy policies for more information on their practices.</p>
<h3>Service Providers</h3>
<p>We partner with other third parties such as a tracking utility company and a live chat provider, to provide specific services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services and not for their own marketing purposes.</p>
<h3>Business Transitions</h3>
<p>In the event that AERS goes through a business transition such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, personal user information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our Website for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the user’s personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section. We may disclose personal information of a user to an agent when in the reasonable judgment of AERS the individual is seeking information as an agent of the user.</p>
<p>Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, we may disclose personal information of a user to a credit reporting agency.</p>
<p>We may disclose personal information of a user to a public agency when in the reasonable judgment of AERS, there is imminent danger to person or property to which such disclosure would avoid or minimize the danger.</p>
<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
<p>We do not use our user’s information for purposes unrelated to our site. We would like to continue to have the user's consent for the purposes and uses of personal information as set out in this privacy statement, however, you as a user may choose to refuse or withdraw your consent by refusing to give us personal information or withdrawing such consent subject to any applicable contractual or notice provisions by emailing us at <a href="/contact/support/terapeak/com">support[at]terapeak[dot]com</a>.</p>

<li>Only collecting personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy statement</li>
<li>Ensuring appropriate security measures are in place</li>
<li>Ensuring appropriate confidentiality measures are in place for personal information when dealing with third party</li>
<li>Ensuring that personal information is kept up to date and current for the purposes in which it is being used</li>
<li>Honoring any user request for access to their personal information</li>
</ol>
<p>When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information such as credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as a registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.</p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line for all of our user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can to do to ensure our user’s information is protected.</p>
<h3>Supplementation of Information</h3>
<p>In order for this Website to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p>
<h3>Credit Card</h3>
<p>We do not conduct credit card validation as all credit card processing for our products and services is undertaken by PayPal or Beanstream.</p>
<h3>Purchasing History</h3>
<p>We do not combine information about the purchasing habits of our users with other third parties.</p>
<h3>Enhancement of Marketing Profile</h3>
<h3>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as name, postal code, zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate user’s personally identifiable information. This can be done by going to the account page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="/contact/support/terapeak/com">support[at]terapeak[dot]com</a>.</p>
<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy statement and or practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. The posting of changes to the privacy statement shall be effective within 30 days of post.</p>
<p>If we are going to use personally identifiable user information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users delete/deactivate their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Website notifying users of the change. In cases where we post a notice we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, to notify them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
