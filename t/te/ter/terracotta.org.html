<h3>Copyright Notice &amp; Privacy Policy</h3>
<h4>All contents copyright Terracotta, Inc. All rights reserved.</h4>

<p>"Terracotta" and the "Terracotta" insignia, as well as all other distinct logos and graphic symbols signifying Terracotta on this web site are trademarks of Terracotta, Inc. All other trademarks referenced are those of their respective owners.</p>

<h5>Privacy Policy</h5>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains our practices with respect to
our use and collection of personally-identifiable
information that we collect from you (a) in the course of
your use of the Terracotta web site accessible at
URL <a href="http://www.terracotta.org/">http://www.terracotta.org</a>
(the "Site"); (b) during any registration process that may
be required for Terracotta software access. Please note that
this Privacy Statement is limited only to your browsing and
operation of the Site, and to your registration.</p>

<p>From time to time, we may amend our Privacy Statement by
posting a revised statement at this URL. If we amend our
Privacy Statement in a manner that materially alters our
treatment of your personally-identifiable information, we
will make reasonable efforts to notify you through the
e-mail address you submit to us, so that you will have an
opportunity to learn about our new privacy practices.</p>

<p>We last updated this Privacy Statement on August 12, 2008.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> We use the term
"Personal Information" to refer to information that would
permit someone to identify or contact you, such as your full
name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal
Information does not include anonymous, aggregated
information that, by itself, does not permit the
identification of individual persons. For example,
statistics about the use of the Site (such as the number of
visitors to our site last month) are not Personal
Information.</p>

<p><strong>Browsing Our Web site: What We Collect and How We
Use It.</strong> While you browse the Site, we may collect
two types of information from you: (a) "Subscription
Information," which you volunteer to us by completing and
submitting a subscription form field built into our Web
pages; and (b) "Other Information," which is collected
automatically as you browse the Site, and which under some
circumstances may be personally-identifiable.</p>

<p><strong>Subscription Information.</strong> Throughout the
Site, there are several form fields that you may use to
subscribe to specific programs offered by Terracotta,
including mailing lists and other forms of periodic
electronic communications. These form fields may include our
"Partner Signup" and "Events Signup" forms. Completing one
of these forms generally involves the submission of an
e-mail address and the selection of a subscription
option. We may use this e-mail address to send you further
communications about the program that you selected.</p>

<p><strong>Other Information.</strong> When you browse the
Site, our servers may automatically collect certain
information about you and your use of the Site, which we use
to perform statistical analyses of the frequency and sources
of page requests. This merely enables us to better
understand who is using the Site, how it is being used, and
allows us both to maintain the operation of the Site and to
create improvements. Ordinarily, most of this information is
not personally-identifiable, but under certain circumstances
it might be combined with, or linked to, your
personally-identifiable information. While so combined or
linked, this Other Information will be considered to be
Personal Information.</p>

<p><strong>Browsing Information.</strong> Our servers
automatically collect the following information about your
Web browsing session: (a) the unique Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) of each Web page that you request; (b) the
date and time of each page request; (c) the HTTP response
code of the page request; and (d) the IP address from which
each Web page request was made. An IP address is a number
that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use
the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same
from browser session to browser session, but if you use a
consumer dial-up Internet access provider, your IP address
probably varies from session to session.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small pieces of
information stored on your own hard drive, not on our
Site. They are used by our servers to maintain your user
session, the purpose of which is to provide you with access
to certain areas of the Site that are available only to
authenticated users. You are always free to decline our
cookies if your browser permits you to do so, but if you do,
those restricted areas of the Site will be unavailable to
you and certain other portions of the Site may not work
properly.</p>

<p><strong>Registering with Us: What We Collect and How We Use
It.</strong> After you download and install software from
us, registration forms may appear as part of the setup
process. When you register, you are presented with a
registration form that you must complete and submit to us in
order to receive access. We refer to the information that
you volunteer as part of this registration form as "Customer
Registration," which may include your real name, your
company and title, a company Web site URL, a mailing
address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, and a user
name and password. From time to time we may modify our
registration form to add or delete certain information; you
will be able to tell exactly what we collect by accessing
the latest version of the registration form.</p>

<p>We use the Registration Information for several purposes:</p>

<p>(1) to identify you and grant you access to certain parts of
the Site, which will allow you to download certain
Terracotta Software;</p>

<p>(2) to take reasonable measures to prevent the Terracotta
Software from being downloaded to destinations
restricted under U.S. export control law;</p>

<p>(3) to evaluate your interests and allow our sales and
marketing representatives to communicate with you
through a variety of means, which may include e-mail,
direct mail, and telephone calls about Terracotta
products, services, and other items likely to be of
interest to you, or to solicit feedback about our
products and services from you; and</p>

<p>(4) to improve our products and services by better
understanding our customers.</p>

<p><strong>Third Parties.</strong> We will not knowingly sell
lists of your Personal Information to third parties for
their marketing purposes. However, under certain
circumstances we may share your Personal Information with
third parties. We may grant access to your Personal
Information to our independent contractors to the extent
necessary for them to maintain, enhance, or add to the
functionality of the Site, our application software, or our
other services. Although Terracotta currently does not have
a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other
companies under common control (collectively, "corporate
affiliates"), it may have corporate affiliates in the
future. Terracotta may share your Personal Information with
its corporate affiliates. If Terracotta is acquired by
another company, that company will possess the Personal
Information collected by Terracotta and it will assume the
rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information
as described in this Privacy Statement. Finally, we may
share your Personal Information with certain of our
strategic business partners that we believe may offer
solutions beneficial to the Terracotta user community. When
we do share such Personal Information with those selected
strategic business partners, those business partners will be
obligated to honor this Privacy Statement.</p>

<p>Please note that we cannot fully ensure that your Personal
Information will not be disclosed to third parties in other
situations. For example, we may be legally obligated to
disclose information to the government or other third
parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may
circumvent our security measures to unlawfully access data
on our servers. Additionally, in the unlikely event that we
need to investigate or resolve possible problems or
inquiries, we can, and you expressly authorize us to,
disclose any information about you to law enforcement or
other government officials as we believe necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Exercising Choice.</strong> When you sign up through
a subscription form field or register with us, you agree to
receive communications relating to the Terracotta products
and services from us. If you later decide that you do not
wish to receive further communications from us, you may
contact us to be removed from our lists. To be removed from
our electronic or direct mail subscription lists, send an
e-mail to unsubscribe@terracotta.org, specifying in your
e-mail whether you wish to stop (a) electronic
communications; (b) direct mail communications; or (c)
both.</p>

<p>We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request
within five (5) business days after receiving your
communication. Even after you have been removed from our
subscription lists, however, we may contact you for
non-marketing purposes related to your use of the Terracotta
products and services, such as for technical reasons or to
solicit feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Updating Your Subscription Information.</strong> If
you wish to update your contact information on one of our
subscription lists, you may send an e-mail to
changeaddress@terracotta.org.</p>

<p><strong>What We Do to Secure Your Information.</strong> We
store data on servers located behind our firewall, in order
to protect against the unauthorized access to or compromise
of information contained on our servers, such as your
Personal Information. However, you should know that in the
present technological environment, no security measures are
perfect, and that neither we nor any other Internet site can
fully eliminate these security risks.</p>

<p><strong>Further Questions?</strong> Our mailing address is
180 Montgomery St., Suite 1675; San Francisco, California
94104; USA. We may be reached by telephone at
415.738.4000. If you have any questions about this Privacy
Statement or the data privacy practices described in it,
please feel free to contact us at privacy@terracotta.org or
at the address or telephone number listed above.</p>
