###  What information do we collect? How do we use it?

When you request information about a product or service or register with one of our sites, we may need to know specific information about you. This enables us to process your registration/ requests and reply to your needs promptly.

Our site’s registration and survey forms require users to give us contact information (like your name, e-mail and address) and demographic information (like your zip code, age or income level). We use customer contact information from these registration and survey forms to send you information about our company, promotional materials and information from our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at our sites and distribute content that we think you might be interested in.

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like your e-mail address) and demographic information (like your zip code, age, income level). We use contact data from our contests to send users promotional data from our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/ opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, distribute content that we think you might be interested in, and display the content according to your preferences. When you enter a contest or promotional feature, we may ask for your contact information so we can administer the contest and notify winners.

When you order products or services from the ServiceMaster Quality Service Network Web sites, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date.

This site contains links to other sites. ServiceMaster is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. We will not pass your information along to the linked site; however, we cannot protect your information if you provide it to that site.

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the ServiceMaster Quality Service Network Web sites (listed above). We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important changes to the Web site, new ServiceMaster services, and special offers and information we think you’ll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us through one of the channels identified in the choice/ opt-out section.

Note to Parents: Your child’s privacy is important to us and that is why we take additional measures to protect the privacy of the younger visitors to our Web site. We have created a children’s area, "Just For Kids," in which we offer content specially designed for children. Currently, we do not collect any personally identifiable information in the children’s area of our site. If we do in the future, we will do so consistent with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

###  How does ServiceMaster protect customer information?

When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us.

ServiceMaster’s digital certificates are issued by VeriSign, one of the most established signers of digital certificates.
