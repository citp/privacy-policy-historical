2\. Data that we collect, save and process about you

The following section will give you an overview of the personal data that we collect, save, and process about you.

We never collect personal data which relates to racial and ethnic origins, political opinions, religious or philosophical worldviews, trade union membership, health, or sexual orientation.

You can explicitly and knowingly make personal information available to us and agree for us to gather it in the following cases:

Email queries (in particular requesting information or support)

On our website (as well as within our products) are links which you can use to send us emails in case you have questions, if you want information or material, or if you want to make comments or suggestions. You also have the opportunity to contact our staff for information about our products and services. In order to deal with your request we may require private data such as your name and phone number.

We reserve the right to save all communication including communication using more transient methods such as chat channels.

2.2 Statistical data relating to your visit

Our computers automatically collect data if you visit our website or use our products (‘usage data’). We keep statistics about the number of visitors to our website, the geographical location of the user, the date and time of the visit, the pages visited, the domain the visitor uses to access our websites, and the browser the visitor uses.

We will potentially register, save and evaluate the actions you undertake within our products.

If you do not wish this information to be traceable to you by other players and related persons we advise you to choose a pseudonym that can in no way be linked to you personally.

This statistical data will only be matched to your personal details if it is necessary to prevent or uncover wrongdoing or a breach of our rules.

We only employ ‘cookies’ in the following situations. The first situation applies to temporary cookies which we employ in two cases. If you use one of our online applications, our web server automatically sends a temporary cookie to your browser to facilitate navigation on our website.

The cookie is erased as soon as you close the current browser window. If you are guided to our website via one of our business partners, our web server also sends a temporary cookie to your browser which contains a ‘source code’ relating to this business partner.

These cookies contain random data that the server uses to authenticate the browser’s request to the server within the session. The cookies do not contain any data with which you can be identified personally. The cookie is erased as soon as you close the active browser window.

The second situation in which we use cookies is requests for product information, documents, services or other enquiries in the course of your visit to our website. If you fill in a form you can choose if our website may send a cookie to you local hard disk (insofar as your browser is not set-up to always accept cookies of this variety). In this case it is not a temporary cookie, but you can disable it at anytime using your browser settings. If you do not wish to accept this kind of cookie you can still use our website. However you can save time by accepting this kind of cookie because there is no need to refill in forms and/or make repeat a visit to our website. Even if you accept this kind of cookie, you can set your browser at anytime to notify you if a cookie is sent to you. Thus you always have the choice whether to accept the cookie or not.
