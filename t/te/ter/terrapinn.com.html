<h3>2. What does Terrapinn do with your personal information?</h3>

<p>All of the personal information described above will be stored on Terrapinn's user database (unless you notify us that you no longer wish us to retain such information, in which case it will be deleted). Terrapinn will only use your personal information in order to contact you (for example by email, mail or telephone) for those purposes to which you have previously consented on the site. For example, if you register on the site, Terrapinn will email to you Terrapinn's newsletter and, if you wish, contact you about relevant products and services offered by Terrapinn or by reputable third parties. Terrapinn will also contact you to market its products and/or services where it has obtained your details in the course of a sale of any of its products or services. If you do not wish to receive information about Terrapinn's and/or third parties' products and services, please tick the relevant box on the registration form when you register or, subsequently, via the "edit my profile" button at the bottom of the home page. You may cancel your subscription to Terrapinn's newsletter at any time by clicking on the link at the foot of any edition of the newsletter or marketing communication.</p>

<p>Should you request us to amend or suppress records containing your information we will endeavour to do so as promptly as practical, however you may receive communications for a transitional period while we process the records.</p>

<p>Terrapinn will also use the information which you provide in aggregate form (i.e. so that no individual users are identifiable) to determine demographic profiles and browsing patterns in order to</p>

<ul>
	<li>develop marketing profiles and assist strategic development;</li>
	<li>manage Terrapinn's relationship with its sponsors and advertisers;</li>
	<li>enable site audits to be performed; and</li>
	<li>enable Terrapinn to review, develop and improve the services which it offers.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, Terrapinn will use your information to notify you about changes to our services.</p>

<p>Terrapinn will also use the personal information collected from your use of the Websites to administer the Websites and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes, to improve our site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer, to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so, as part of our efforts to keep the Websites safe and secure, to measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you, and to make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of our site about goods or services that may interest you or them.</p>

<h3>3. Keeping your personal information up to date</h3>

<p>We take all reasonable action to ensure that the information we collect and use is accurate, complete and up-to-date.</p>

<p>However, the accuracy of the information depends to a large extent on the information you provide. That’s why we recommend that you</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep us up-to-date with changes to your information such as your name and address; and</li>
	<li>Let us know if there are any errors in the information</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. To whom is your personal information disclosed?</h3>

<p>Each Terrapinn entity will share your personal information with the other members of its group which means its subsidiaries, ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries and (provided that you have not ticked the opt-out box on the registration form) will make your name and postal address available to reputable third parties so that they can send you details of their products and services.</p>

<p>In supplying Terrapinn with your personal information, you agree that Terrapinn may transfer that information (to the extent that it is still held on our database at the relevant time) to a third party who acquires all or substantially all of any Terrapinn entity's assets or stock or our Website services whether by merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise.</p>

<p>Terrapinn will also share your personal information with selected third parties including business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract it enters into with them or you, and/or, to the extent you have consented, advertisers and advertising networks that require your data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others.</p>

<h3>5. Transfers of personal information overseas</h3>

<p>As the internet is a global environment, the personal information that we collect from you will likely be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilments of any of your orders, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal information, you acknowledge this transfer, storing or processing. We will take the appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that your data are treated securely.</p>

<h3>6. When does this Privacy Policy not apply?</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy only applies to the collection and use of data by Terrapinn. It does not cover third party sites to which we provide links. Those sites may have their own privacy policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to these websites.</p>

<h3>7. How do we protect your information?</h3>

<p>Terrapinn is committed to data security and will take the appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that your personal information is treated securely. If you subscribe to access our premium content (and, accordingly, enter payment details), Terrapinn offers the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts all information which you input before it is sent to Terrapinn.</p>

<p>Terrapinn takes steps to guard against unauthorised access to the personal information of the users of the Websites. Although it makes every effort to create a secure environment for your personal information, Terrapinn cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information which is transmitted to us on-line and/or via email as, unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although Terrapinn will take appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information, any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use appropriate technical and organisational measures to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<p>Where Terrapinn has given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>

<h3>8. How can you access personal information held by Terrapinn about you?</h3>

<p>The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request will be subject to a fee of £10 to meet Terrapinn's costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
