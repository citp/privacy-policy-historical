							<li>
								<span style="font-size: 12px">When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</span></li>

					<span style="font-size: 12px">Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information.

				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px"><em>Aggregated and non-personal information</em>. We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. This aggregated data does not contain any personal information. We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites, on websites of third parties, or by other means. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>Third-party websites</strong><br>
					There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a link on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the web page you are visiting.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>How you can access your information</strong><br>

				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px">If you have an online account with us, you also may choose to close your account at any time by contacting Territory Ahead customer service. However, you can open a new account at any time. If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and record keeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our web site or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties’ policies.</span></p>

					<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>Your choices about collection and use of your information</strong></span></p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 25px">
					<li>
						<span style="font-size: 12px">You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services through our website or by phone or fax; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website.</span></li>
					<li>
						<span style="font-size: 12px">At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us. When your register or provide your email address on our website, you will be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email messages about special offers. You may modify your choice at any time. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.</span></li>
					<li>
						<span style="font-size: 12px">Opt-out. If you do not wish to receive mailings from other companies or to have personal information shared with other companies, please contact us by phone, email or mail.</span></li>

				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>How we protect your personal information</strong><br>
					We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px">We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" style="text-decoration: underline" target="new">www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>Product Reviews</strong><br>
					We may provide areas on our website where you can post reviews of products. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you will not be able to edit or delete such information.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>Children's privacy</strong><br>
					Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>Visiting our websites from outside the United States</strong><br>
					This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information on our website from residents of the United States. If you are visiting our website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>No Rights of Third Parties</strong><br>
					This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.</span></p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size: 12px"><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
					We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address you most recently provided us in your account, profile or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our website. We recommend that you check our website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</span></p>
