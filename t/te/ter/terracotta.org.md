## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains our practices with respect to our use and collection of personally-identifiable information that we collect from you (a) in the course of your use of the Terracotta web site accessible at URL [http://www.terracotta.org](http://www.terracotta.org/) (the "Site"); (b) during any registration process that may be required for Terracotta software access. Please note that this Privacy Statement is limited only to your browsing and operation of the Site, and to your registration.

From time to time, we may amend our Privacy Statement by posting a revised statement at this URL. If we amend our Privacy Statement in a manner that materially alters our treatment of your personally-identifiable information, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you through the e-mail address you submit to us, so that you will have an opportunity to learn about our new privacy practices.

We last updated this Privacy Statement on August 12, 2008.

**Personal Information.** We use the term "Personal Information" to refer to information that would permit someone to identify or contact you, such as your full name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal Information does not include anonymous, aggregated information that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons. For example, statistics about the use of the Site (such as the number of visitors to our site last month) are not Personal Information.

**Browsing Our Web site: What We Collect and How We Use It.** While you browse the Site, we may collect two types of information from you: (a) "Subscription Information," which you volunteer to us by completing and submitting a subscription form field built into our Web pages; and (b) "Other Information," which is collected automatically as you browse the Site, and which under some circumstances may be personally-identifiable.

**Subscription Information.** Throughout the Site, there are several form fields that you may use to subscribe to specific programs offered by Terracotta, including mailing lists and other forms of periodic electronic communications. These form fields may include our "Partner Signup" and "Events Signup" forms. Completing one of these forms generally involves the submission of an e-mail address and the selection of a subscription option. We may use this e-mail address to send you further communications about the program that you selected.

**Other Information.** When you browse the Site, our servers may automatically collect certain information about you and your use of the Site, which we use to perform statistical analyses of the frequency and sources of page requests. This merely enables us to better understand who is using the Site, how it is being used, and allows us both to maintain the operation of the Site and to create improvements. Ordinarily, most of this information is not personally-identifiable, but under certain circumstances it might be combined with, or linked to, your personally-identifiable information. While so combined or linked, this Other Information will be considered to be Personal Information.

**Browsing Information.** Our servers automatically collect the following information about your Web browsing session: (a) the unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of each Web page that you request; (b) the date and time of each page request; (c) the HTTP response code of the page request; and (d) the IP address from which each Web page request was made. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session, but if you use a consumer dial-up Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.

**Cookies.** Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your own hard drive, not on our Site. They are used by our servers to maintain your user session, the purpose of which is to provide you with access to certain areas of the Site that are available only to authenticated users. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits you to do so, but if you do, those restricted areas of the Site will be unavailable to you and certain other portions of the Site may not work properly.

**Registering with Us: What We Collect and How We Use It.** After you download and install software from us, registration forms may appear as part of the setup process. When you register, you are presented with a registration form that you must complete and submit to us in order to receive access. We refer to the information that you volunteer as part of this registration form as "Customer Registration," which may include your real name, your company and title, a company Web site URL, a mailing address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, and a user name and password. From time to time we may modify our registration form to add or delete certain information; you will be able to tell exactly what we collect by accessing the latest version of the registration form.

We use the Registration Information for several purposes:

(1) to identify you and grant you access to certain parts of the Site, which will allow you to download certain Terracotta Software;

(2) to take reasonable measures to prevent the Terracotta Software from being downloaded to destinations restricted under U.S. export control law;

(3) to evaluate your interests and allow our sales and marketing representatives to communicate with you through a variety of means, which may include e-mail, direct mail, and telephone calls about Terracotta products, services, and other items likely to be of interest to you, or to solicit feedback about our products and services from you; and

(4) to improve our products and services by better understanding our customers.

**Third Parties.** We will not knowingly sell lists of your Personal Information to third parties for their marketing purposes. However, under certain circumstances we may share your Personal Information with third parties. We may grant access to your Personal Information to our independent contractors to the extent necessary for them to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Site, our application software, or our other services. Although Terracotta currently does not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively, "corporate affiliates"), it may have corporate affiliates in the future. Terracotta may share your Personal Information with its corporate affiliates. If Terracotta is acquired by another company, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by Terracotta and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Statement. Finally, we may share your Personal Information with certain of our strategic business partners that we believe may offer solutions beneficial to the Terracotta user community. When we do share such Personal Information with those selected strategic business partners, those business partners will be obligated to honor this Privacy Statement.

Please note that we cannot fully ensure that your Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties in other situations. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or other third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully access data on our servers. Additionally, in the unlikely event that we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can, and you expressly authorize us to, disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we believe necessary.

**Exercising Choice.** When you sign up through a subscription form field or register with us, you agree to receive communications relating to the Terracotta products and services from us. If you later decide that you do not wish to receive further communications from us, you may contact us to be removed from our lists. To be removed from our electronic or direct mail subscription lists, send an e-mail to unsubscribe@terracotta.org, specifying in your e-mail whether you wish to stop (a) electronic communications; (b) direct mail communications; or (c) both.

We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request within five (5) business days after receiving your communication. Even after you have been removed from our subscription lists, however, we may contact you for non-marketing purposes related to your use of the Terracotta products and services, such as for technical reasons or to solicit feedback.

**Updating Your Subscription Information.** If you wish to update your contact information on one of our subscription lists, you may send an e-mail to changeaddress@terracotta.org.

**What We Do to Secure Your Information.** We store data on servers located behind our firewall, in order to protect against the unauthorized access to or compromise of information contained on our servers, such as your Personal Information. However, you should know that in the present technological environment, no security measures are perfect, and that neither we nor any other Internet site can fully eliminate these security risks.

**Further Questions?** Our mailing address is 650 Townsend Street, Suite 325; San Francisco, California 94103; USA. We may be reached by telephone at 415.738.4000. If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement or the data privacy practices described in it, please feel free to contact us at privacy@terracotta.org or at the address or telephone number listed above.
