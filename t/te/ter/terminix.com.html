                    What information do we collect? How do we use it?</h3>
                <p>
                    When you request information about a product or service or register with one of
                    our sites, we may need to know specific information about you. This enables us to
                    process your registration/ requests and reply to your needs promptly.</p>
            <p>
                Our site’s registration and survey forms require users to give us contact
                information (like your name, e-mail and address) and demographic information (like
                your zip code, age or income level). We use customer contact information from these
                registration and survey forms to send you information about our company, promotional
                materials and information from our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future
                mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is
                also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at our sites
                and distribute content that we think you might be interested in.</p>
            <p>
                We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like
                your e-mail address) and demographic information (like your zip code, age, income
                level). We use contact data from our contests to send users promotional data from
                our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/ opt-out
                section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use
                this data to tailor your experience at our site, distribute content that we think
                you might be interested in, and display the content according to your preferences.
                When you enter a contest or promotional feature, we may ask for your contact information
                so we can administer the contest and notify winners.</p>
            <p>
                When you order products or services from the ServiceMaster Quality Service Network
                Web sites, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card
                number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and
                to notify you of your order status. To learn more about our encryption policies,
                please review the section on How does ServiceMaster protect customer information.</p>

                We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design
                and layout of the ServiceMaster Quality Service Network Web sites (listed above).
                We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important
                changes to the Web site, new ServiceMaster services, and special offers and information
                we think you’ll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information,

                Note to Parents: Your child’s privacy is important to us and that is why we
                take additional measures to protect the privacy of the younger visitors to our Web
                site. We have created a children’s area, "Just For Kids," in which
                we offer content specially designed for children. Currently, we do not collect any
                personally identifiable information in the children’s area of our site. If
                we do in the future, we will do so consistent with the requirements of the Children’s
                Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>
            <h3>
                How does ServiceMaster protect customer information?</h3>
            <p>
                When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server.
                This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypts all information
                you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer transactional
                data we collect is protected against unauthorized access with the use of digital
                certificates. ServiceMaster’s digital certificates are issued by VeriSign,
                one of the most established signers of digital certificates. To learn more about
                ServiceMaster’s online security simply click on the "Security" icon
                in your browser tool bar.</p>
            <h3>
                What about cookies?</h3>
            <p>
                "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser
                on your computer’s hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying
                information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
                change your browser to prevent that. Even without accepting cookies, you can still
                use most of the features throughout the ServiceMaster Quality Service Network Web
                sites.</p>
            <p>
                Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don’t
                see the same advertisement or content repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver information
                specific to your interests and to save your password so you don’t have to
                re-enter it each time you visit our site.</p>
            <h3>
                Will ServiceMaster disclose information it collects to outside parties?</h3>
            <p>
                ServiceMaster does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.
                We may choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, but you can
                request that we do not by emailing us at <a href="mailto:customercare@svm.com">customercare@svm.com</a>
                (If you use more than one e-mail address to shop with us, send this message from
                each e-mail account you use). Also, ServiceMaster may provide aggregate statistics
                about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable
                third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying information.</p>
