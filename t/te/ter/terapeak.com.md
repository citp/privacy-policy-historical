### Links

This Website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that AERS Inc., is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.

### Surveys & Contests

From time to time our site requests information from users via internal or in-house surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as postal or zip code). Contact information will be used to notify winners and award prizes and shared with the contest and survey sponsors. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the user experience within the Website. User’s personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties as all surveys and contests are internal and or in-house.

## Security

This Website takes every precaution to protect our user’s information. When users submit sensitive information via the Website, their information is protected both online and off-line. All payments are handled through PayPal or Beanstream.

We protect personal information and the user's right to privacy by:

  1. Only collecting personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy statement
  2. Ensuring appropriate security measures are in place
  3. Ensuring appropriate confidentiality measures are in place for personal information when dealing with third party
  4. Ensuring that personal information is kept up to date and current for the purposes in which it is being used
  5. Honoring any user request for access to their personal information



When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information such as credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as a registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line for all of our user information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every time new policies are added, our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can to do to ensure our user’s information is protected.

## Supplementation of Information

In order for this Website to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

### Credit Card

We do not conduct credit card validation as all credit card processing for our products and services is undertaken by PayPal or Beanstream.

### Purchasing History

We do not combine information about the purchasing habits of our users with other third parties.

## Enhancement of Marketing Profile

### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as name, postal code, zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate user’s personally identifiable information. This can be done by going to the account page or by emailing our Customer Support at [privacy@terapeak.com](mailto:privacy@terapeak.com).

### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy statement and or practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. The posting of changes to the privacy statement shall be effective within 30 days of post.

If we are going to use personally identifiable user information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users delete/deactivate their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Website notifying users of the change. In cases where we post a notice we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, to notify them of the changes in our privacy practices.

## Contact Information

Otherwise, we assume that we have you - the user of our Website and or on-line services - consent to collect, use and disclose your personal information for the purposes and uses identified in this privacy statement.
