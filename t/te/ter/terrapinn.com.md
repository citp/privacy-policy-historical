# Terrapinn | privacy

Terrapinn Limited and its group companies (together, "Terrapinn") are committed to safeguarding the privacy of the users of the Terrapinn website, while providing a service which is tailored to suit their needs.  Please take a moment to read our Privacy Policy as it describes what happens to the personal information which you supply to Terrapinn.  Terrapinn reserves the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time.

**1.  What information does Terrapinn hold about you and how is it collected?**

If you register on the Terrapinn site, your personal information (including your name, job title, company's name, telephone, fax and mobile numbers, postal and email address) is collected by Terrapinn.  We also collect personal information from you when you contact us (by email or otherwise).

In common with many other on-line services, if you have registered on the Terrapinn site, we may use "cookies" to store and sometimes track information about you, but only on an anonymous basis.  A cookie is a small amount of data sent from the server which is stored on your PC's hard drive.  You can set your browser to refuse cookies or ask your browser to show you where cookies have been set up.  Certain services are only activated by the presence of a cookie and, if you choose to reject the cookie, a particular on-line feature may not be available to you.

**2.  What does Terrapinn do with your personal information?**

All of the personal information described above will be stored on Terrapinn's user database (unless you notify us that you no longer wish us to retain such information, in which case it will be deleted).

Terrapinn will only use your personal information in order to contact you (for example by email, mail or telephone) for those purposes to which you have previously consented on the site.  For example, if you register on the site, Terrapinn will email to you Terrapinn's newsletter and, if you wish, contact you about relevant products and services offered by Terrapinn or by reputable third parties.  If you do not wish to receive information about Terrapinn's and/or third parties' products and services, please tick the relevant box on the registration form when you register or, subsequently, via the "edit my profile" button at the bottom of the home page.  You may cancel your subscription to Terrapinn's newsletter at any time by clicking on the link at the foot of any edition of the newsletter.

  Terrapinn will also use the information which you provide in aggregate form (i.e. so that no individual users are identifiable) to determine demographic profiles and browsing patterns in order to:

  1. develop marketing profiles and assist strategic development;
  2. manage Terrapinn's relationship with its sponsors and advertisers;
  3. enable site audits to be performed; and
  4. enable Terrapinn to review, develop and improve the services which it offers.



**4.  To whom is your personal information disclosed?**

Terrapinn will share your personal information with the other members of its group and (provided that you have not ticked the opt-out box on the registration form) will make your name and postal address available to reputable third parties so that they can send you details of their products and services.  In supplying Terrapinn with your personal information, you agree that Terrapinn may transfer that information (to the extent that it is still held on our database at the relevant time) to a third party who acquires all or substantially all or Terrapinn's assets or stock or our website services whether by merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise.  Terrapinn will not otherwise disclose your personal information to any third parties.

**5.  Transfers of personal information overseas**

As the internet is a global environment, using the internet to collect and process personal information necessarily involves the transmission of that information worldwide.  Terrapinn will also share your personal information with members of its group which are located overseas.  By registering on the Terrapinn site and communicating with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of your personal information in this way.

**6.  When does this Privacy Policy not apply?**

This Privacy Policy only applies to the collection and use of data by Terrapinn.  It does not cover third party sites to which we provide links.  Those sites may have their own privacy policies.

If you send to us contributions containing personal information to be posted on the Terrapinn site, this information will be publicly accessible and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.

**7.  How do we protect your information?**

Terrapinn is committed to data security.  If you subscribe to access our premium content (and, accordingly, enter payment details), Terrapinn offers the use of a secure server.  The secure server software encrypts all information which you input before it is sent to Terrapinn. Terrapinn takes steps to guard against unauthorised access to the personal information of the users of its site.  Although it makes every effort to create a secure environment for your personal information, Terrapinn cannot guarantee the safety of any personal information which is transmitted to us on-line.

**8.  Contacting us**

If you have any questions or concerns about Terrapinn's use of your personal information, please email Klaudia Gowero at [compliance@terrapinn.com](mailto:compliance@terrapinn.com) or write to her at Terrapinn Holdings Limited, Welken House, 10-11 Charterhouse Square, London EC1M 6EH
