<h3>Privacy Policy – Australian Tennis Organisations</h3>
<h4>
1. Protecting Privacy and application of this Privacy Policy<br>
</h4>
<ol style="list-style:none;margin-top: 18px;">
<li>
<strong>1.1</strong> Tennis Australia Limited (<strong>Tennis Australia</strong>) is the governing body of tennis in Australia. Tennis Australia organises a number of tennis events including, without limitation, the Australian Open and Australian Open Series events. Tennis Australia also manages and promotes various tennis programs, including without limitation, MLC Tennis Hot Shots and Cardio Tennis.
</li>
<li style="margin-top: 9px;">
<strong>1.2</strong> In its role as the governing body of tennis in Australia, Tennis Australia is committed to the protection of your personal information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles set out in the <em>Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)</em>.
</li>
<li style="margin-top: 9px;">
<strong>1.3</strong> In Australia, tennis programs, events and activities are implemented and conducted by a number of different tennis organisations across the country. Accordingly, Tennis Australia has developed this privacy policy to apply to each Australian Tennis Organisation (<strong>ATO</strong>).
</li>
<li style="margin-top: 9px;">
<strong>1.4</strong> For the purpose of this policy, each of the following is an <strong>A</strong><strong>TO</strong>:
</li>
<li>
<ol style="list-style:none;">
<li><strong>(a)</strong> <strong>Tennis Australia</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>(b)</strong> <strong>Member Associations</strong>, being the governing body of tennis in each Australian State and Territory known as Tennis ACT, Tennis Victoria, Tennis New South Wales, Tennis Queensland, Tennis NT, Tennis West, Tennis SA and Tennis Tasmania, </li>
<li><strong>(c)</strong> <strong>Affiliated Organisations</strong>, being those organisations (other than Member Associations, Regional Associations and Affiliated Clubs) which are affiliated to Tennis Australia from time to time in accordance with its constitution,</li>
<li><strong>(d)</strong> <strong>Member Affiliated Organisations</strong>, being those organisations (other than Regional Associations and Affiliated Clubs) which are members of or affiliated to Member Associations and/or Affiliated Organisations and by way of example include Tennis Umpires Australia Queensland Division Inc and Tennis Seniors New South Wales Inc.,</li>

<li><strong>(f)</strong> <strong>Affiliated Clubs</strong>, being those tennis clubs, which are a member of or affiliated to a Regional Association and/or Member Association,</li>
</ol>
<p>if they are required to have a privacy policy under Australian privacy laws, and they have not chosen to adopt a separate privacy policy.</p>
</li>
<li style="margin-top: 9px;">
<strong>1.5</strong> This privacy policy describes the manner in which ATOs may collect, hold and use personal information. By providing your personal information to an ATO, you consent to its use, storage and disclosure in accordance with this privacy policy.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 9px;">
<strong>1.6</strong> It is important to note that only tennis organisations that are affiliated with Tennis Australia can be an ATO. If you choose to deal with a non-affiliated tennis organisation, this privacy policy will not apply.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 9px;">
<strong>1.7</strong> Tennis Australia may, from time to time, review and update this privacy policy to adapt to changing business practises, and to take into account new laws and technology. The use, storage and disclosure of all personal information held by an ATO will be governed by the most recent privacy policy, posted on the <a href="http://www.tennis.com.au">www.tennis.com.au</a> website at <a href="http://www.tennis.com.au/privacy">http://www.tennis.com.au/privacy</a>.</li>

</li>
</ol>
<h4>
4. What personal information may be collected about you?<br>
</h4>
<ol style="list-style:none;margin-top: 18px;">
<li style="margin-top: 9px;">
<strong>4.1</strong> The kinds of personal information that an ATO collects about you will depend on the primary purpose for which such information was collected. An ATO may collect and store various kinds of information about you in connection with its legitimate functions and activities, including, without limitation:</li>

<strong>(b)</strong> your date of birth, age, gender, tennis rankings and results;
</li>
<li>
<strong>(c)</strong> details of tennis programs that you have participated in and the organisations that you have participated with;

<li style="margin-top: 9px;">
<strong>4.2</strong> Some of the information that you give to an ATO may be required. Other information may be optional. If you do not give an ATO some of, or all, the personal information that it requests, it may affect the ATO’s ability to communicate with you. It may also affect the ATOs ability to provide products or services to you and it may affect your ability to participate in programs conducted by an ATO or apply for employment or volunteer positions with an ATO. If it is impracticable for an ATO to deal with you in circumstances where you have not provided the information or consents that it has requested, it may decline to do so.</li>
</ol>
