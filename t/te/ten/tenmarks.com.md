# TenMarks | Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

#### Last Modified: August 22, 2017

At TenMarks Education LLC, we understand how important privacy is to our customers, and we are committed to providing a safe and secure learning experience for students, educators, and parents who use our websites, services, and software (collectively, our "Programs"). As a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc., the information we receive is subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice at <http://www.amazon.com/privacy> (as supplemented by this policy).

We provide additional privacy safeguards to the students who use our Programs, and we have signed the [Student Privacy Pledge](http://studentprivacypledge.org/).

We are committed to complying with the student data privacy laws that apply to your use of our Programs and helping our customers comply with FERPA. Read more below and in our [Terms of Use](https://www.tenmarks.com/terms-of-use).

This policy describes our privacy practices for Student Information we receive about a student's use of our Programs. We use the term "Student Information" in this policy to refer to information that personally identifies a student and other information we receive about a student that is linked to information that personally identifies a student. Student Information does not include de-identified or aggregated information that does not personally identify an individual student.

They may have access to Student Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for any other purposes.
  

  3. **Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might merge with other businesses or sell substantially all of our assets. In such transactions, Student Information would be one of the transferred business assets, but will remain subject to the promises made in this policy.

#### Can a Student, Educator, or Parent Opt-Out of Providing Student Information?

Our Programs are individualized and customized for each student, so the Student Information we receive is required for a student to use our Programs.

#### Additional Frequently Asked Questions Related to Student Data Privacy

**Can a student retain control of any student-generated content, including transferring it to a personal account?**   
Yes, students using TenMarks Writing may download the final version of student-generated essays. TenMarks Math does not involve the creation of student-generated content. 

**Can parents, legal guardians, or students review Student Information in the student's records and correct erroneous information?**   
A parent, legal guardian, or student may review Student Information in the applicable student's records by viewing their TenMarks account. To correct any erroneous information, the parent, legal guardian, or student can ask the applicable student's teacher or TenMarks customer support to make the changes. 

**What does TenMarks do to ensure the security and confidentiality of Student Information?**   
We take a number of steps to protect the security and confidentiality of Student Information. We leverage industry-standard software, encryption, and the leading infrastructure of Amazon Web Services to ensure the security of that information. All team members with access to Student Information are required to take regular training on their responsibilities in protecting that information against technical and social engineering threats. Access to sensitive Student Information is provided only to employees with a business need, and is immediately removed upon the termination of the employee. 

**What does TenMarks do if there is an unauthorized disclosure of Student Information?**   
Within 48 hours of learning about a data breach, or longer reasonable time as may be required by the legitimate needs of applicable law enforcement or as to take measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity of its systems, TenMarks will notify all teachers, parents, principals, and district administrators whose information may have been improperly disclosed, via email communication to the email address on file for each user. Since TenMarks does not maintain any contact information for students, TenMarks will inform any users who oversee those students (i.e. relevant teachers, parents, principals, and district administrators) if any Student Information is involved. This email notification will describe the nature of the data breach and steps that are being taken to protect their TenMarks accounts going forward. 

**Can a school, district or teacher request that TenMarks delete Student Information?**   
Yes. Following the termination of a license, a school or district may request that TenMarks delete or de-identify Student Information and TenMarks will do so. A teacher who purchases a TenMarks license may also request that TenMarks delete or de-identify Student Information after termination of that license.
