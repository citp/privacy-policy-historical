### 3\. Cookies

#### What are cookies?

We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.

We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.

#### Cookies we use

Our site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:

Type of cookie  |  Purpose   
---|---  
_Essential Cookies_ | 

These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Site and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.  
  
_Functionality Cookies_ | 

These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Site which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Site.  
  
_Analytics and Performance Cookies_ | 

These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site.

We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how our Site works. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: <https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies>. You can find out more about how Google protects your data here: [www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).  
  
_Targeted and advertising cookies_ | 

These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites. 

You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting [http://www.youronlinechoices.com/](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) or <http://optout.aboutads.info/>. If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements, but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.  
  
_Social Media Cookies_ |  These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on [our Site/Application(s)/Services] or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that you have done this.   
  
#### Disabling cookies

You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility).  Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.

### 7\. Anonymous Data

When we use the term “anonymous data,” we are referring to data and information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third party.

We may create anonymous data from the Personal Data we receive about you and other individuals whose Personal Data we collect. Anonymous data might include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies.  We make Personal Data into anonymous data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.  We use this anonymous data for our own purposes, including the ability to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our Site.

### 8\. Third Party Sites

Our Site may contain links to third party websites and features. This Policy does not cover the privacy practices of such third parties. These third parties have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their websites, features or policies.  Please read their privacy policies before you submit any data to them. For example, we may link to social media pages through widgets on our Site or we may provide links to industry reports.

### 10\. International Data Transfer

Your information, including Personal Data that we collect from you, may be transferred to, stored and processed by us and our affiliates and other third parties outside the country in which you reside, including, but not limited to the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. By using our Site, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), your Personal Data may be processed outside of the EEA and in countries which are not subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission. In this event, we will ensure that the recipient of your Personal Data offers an adequate level of protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission, or ensuring that such recipient is certified under the U.S.-EU and/or U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

#### EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield

Tenable complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the EU, UK, and Switzerland to the United States. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall take precedence. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, the Privacy Shield Principles and to view our certification, please visit [www.privacyshield.gov](http://www.privacyshield.gov/).

As described in the Privacy Shield Principles, Tenable is accountable for Personal Data that it receives and subsequently transfers to third parties. If third parties that process Personal Data on our behalf do so in a manner that does not comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are accountable, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Tenable commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data.  EU, UK, and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Policy should first contact us at [privacy@tenable.com](mailto:privacy@tenable.com).

Tenable has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, if we have not resolved your complaint, or wish to file a complaint, you can file a complaint with JAMS online HERE  or contact:

JAMS  
Attn: Kathleen Pierz, Practice Development Manager, Global Privacy Shield and Safe Harbor Coordinator

The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.

As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration before a Privacy Shield Panel will also be made available to you in order to address residual complaints not resolved by any other means. Tenable is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

#### Employee Personal Data under Privacy Shield

Tenable commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (“ **DPAs** ”), the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (“ **ICO** ”), and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (“ **FDPIC** ”) and comply with the advice given by the panel with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU, UK, and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship. Please contact us to be directed to the relevant DPA contacts.

### 11\. Security

We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect Personal Data within our organization. Unfortunately, no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be completely secure, and transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us using the details in Section 17 below.

### 12\. Retention

We will  retain your Personal Data for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection (see Section 5, “Using Your Personal Data”). We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable minimum statutory retention requirements). After the expiration of the applicable retention periods, we will delete your Personal Data. If there is any data that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete entirely from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further use of such data.

### 13\. Our Policy on Children

We respect the sensitive nature of children’s privacy online. Our Site is not directed to children under 18 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at [privacy@tenable.com](mailto:privacy@tenable.com). We will delete such information from our systems as soon as reasonably practicable.

We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event, within one month of your request. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, legal purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion.

#### Your Rights Relating to Customer Data

As described above, we may also process Personal Data submitted by or for a customer of our products and services. To this end, if not addressed in this Policy or in a separate disclosure, we process such Personal Data in our role as processor on behalf of a customer (and/or its affiliates) who is the responsible controller of the Personal Data concerned. We are not responsible for and have no control over the privacy and data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this Policy. If your data has been submitted to us by or on behalf a Tenable customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with the applicable customer directly. If you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide to us the name of the Tenable customer who submitted your data to us. We will refer your request to that customer, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

Tenable will honor your requests to opt-out of specified emails and marketing materials. Please note that opting out of marketing communications does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as communications about your subscriptions or event registrations, service announcements, or security information.

### 15\. Your California Privacy Rights

Under California law, a California resident who has provided Tenable with Personal Data (a “California Customer”) is entitled to request certain information with respect to the types of Personal Data that Tenable has shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. In accordance with California law, Tenable will, in response to your written request, provide you with the means to choose not to have your information shared.

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy (including, but not limited to, sharing information with our third party resellers), we will not share your Personal Data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. To prevent further disclosure to your Personal Data from use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide Personal Data on our Site. If you opt-in to receive communication from a third party, your Personal Data will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your Personal Data, you must contact that third party directly, as Tenable has no control over a third party’s use of Personal Data. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing [privacy@tenable.com](mailto:privacy@tenable.com). Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer per year and are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
