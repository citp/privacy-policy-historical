# Tenrox - Privacy

Privacy

In order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. These statistics are used to help us improve our site to make it more useful to visitors. 

The information we receive is based on your choices as you visit our site. In most cases demographic and profile data is collected. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. Any information you choose to provide, is used only for internal purposes and is not shared with any other organizations for any purpose outside of Tenrox and business partners. We may contact you to follow up if we receive any specific information requests via the online forms or email unless you indicate otherwise.

This site contains links to other sites. Tenrox is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other sites. 

Our site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 

Tenrox uses “cookies" to store member names and passwords for the online purchase or for users who wish to gain access to any private areas. Cookies allow us to both store and retrieve login information through a user's browser. A "cookie" is information stored on your computer by a web server and used to customize your web service in some way. Our sites may use cookies to offer faster responses or help customize users' sessions. Like most Internet sites, we do keep standard log records to improve our sites, to provide better information in the future and to be sure we are using resources wisely. These logs may include the user's IP address or system domain name, computer type, browser version, date and time of the visit, names of files requested and the referring page. You can set your browser software to disable cookies or to prompt you before a cookie is accepted. Our Web server automatically asks a new user whether his or her browser will agree to accept a "cookie" via the Web browser. If a visitor accepts, our Web server will identify the user's cookie for Tenrox's use in internal reporting or, for site personalization. If a user accepts a cookie, but would later like to remove it from his or her browser, he or she can follow the removal instructions found at our [cookie information page](https://web.archive.org/web/20031205010346id_/http%3A//www.tenrox.com/en/help/cookies.htm) **.**

The Tenrox Web site may contain links to other sites, distributors and sales affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

If we believe someone is trying to break into, has broken into or has otherwise abused our computers over the Internet, we can use the information in our logs to try to find those who are responsible. As part of these efforts we may share the information with law enforcement agencies and others.

We value your opinion. If you have any questions or comments regarding this Privacy Statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, please send us an [e-mail](mailto:privacy@tenrox.com).
