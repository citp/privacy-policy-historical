# Privacy Policy of TendersInfo website

## Privacy Statement

At **Euclid Infotech Limited(Formerly known as Euclid Infotech Private Limited)** we place great emphasis on the need to respect the privacy of our customers and Web site visitors.

Where you are required to register before accessing a service, the information gathered is used for invoicing, issuing passwords, and for the occasional dispatch of information which may help you to make better use of our services. We will respect your email privacy, and no customer or visitor information will be passed on to third parties without your prior consent.

All of your data is now subject to the new GDPR regulation. Your data will be used for strictly professional, commercial and informative terms only. Your data will not be sold, and only shared where you have agreed to do so, as stated in the privacy policy. We only gather the necessary information to contact you to provide legitimate business information.

We do make use of software allowing us to carry out aggregate analysis of traffic to our Web sites, but no individual visitor or customer may be identified in any report generated from this analysis. This information is used simply to allow us to improve the site in line with the needs of our customers and visitors.

We also make use of "cookies", small text files stored on your hard drive which allow a Web site to recognise you as a repeat visitor, or to store session information whilst you are searching a database. They enable you to avoid some of the more routine, repetitive tasks associated with using our Web sites. It is common practice for Web sites to make use of these files. We use them simply to extend the functionality of the service we offer, and do not collect or distribute the information to any unrelated third party for marketing or other purposes. You do however have the option of not accepting cookies through settings in your Web browser

You have the right to ask for a copy of the information we hold about you at any time, and to request any amendments if necessary. To do so, or if you have any comments or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact: **[webmaster@tendersinfo.com](mailto:webmaster@tendersinfo.com)**
