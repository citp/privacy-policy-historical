A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the Website.

Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

We may use cookies to monitor usage of the Website and to create a personal record of when you visit the Website and what pages you view so that we may serve you more effectively.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

We may use web beacons on the Website from time to time. Web beacons or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behaviour and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page.

We only provide personal information to third parties if we consider that the third party can comply with the standards in our Privacy Policy.
