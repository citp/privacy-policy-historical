### 1\. Types of Information We Collect

When you access the Services, we collect personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you or can be used to contact you. The personal information we collect may include, but is not limited to, full name, address, zip code, telephone number(s), email address, date of birth, cable provider, gender, username and password, location data, other personal data as detailed in this Privacy Policy and data that may be requested from and provided by you, and, in certain instances, your payment card information. In addition, we may also collect other anonymous information about you that may not allow someone to personally identify you. When using the Services, you may be asked to provide various types of personally identifiable information or anonymous information to enhance your experience on the Services. We may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information, aggregate information.

To sign up for or participate in any features or functions, you may be required to provide us with certain personally identifiable information or other information about you in order for us to personalize and/or allow you to use such features and functions. For example, when you subscribe to e-mail newsletters, participate in competitions or games, purchase merchandise, etc., you may be required to provide your email address, date of birth and zip code. Further, for example, to the extent we offer such services, if you order any of our various products, in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and may maintain your billing address, shipping address, product selections, your credit card or other payment instrument information, your order number and information about your computer's internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Services (e.g. the referring URL). Your credit card or debit card number is collected via a secure transmission.

There may be a separate registration process to enter promotions such as contests and sweepstakes which may require the submission of all or some of the following: your first and last name, street address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number and date of birth. Additional information may be requested depending on the specific promotion, but submission of such information may be optional. The promotion's entry page and/or rules will provide the specific requirements. You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special promotions or offers from our third party advertisers, sponsors or promotional partners as a result of your use of the Services in connection with many of these types of promotions.

If we collect such information, in most instances, the applicable page(s) or location(s) within the Services will include statements regarding what information is required for the elements of the Services to function properly and functionality for you to submit the requested or required information. In addition to the list above, there may also be opportunities for you to grant permission for use of other of your information in a manner set forth on the applicable page(s) within the Services. You may choose not to provide certain information, but some of our features require personally identifiable information in order to be accessible and/or operate effectively.

### 2\. How We Collect Your Information

 _ **Information You Give Us**_. We receive and store any information you enter on our Services, submit through emails or other communication, or provide to us in any other way (including but not limited to: reviews, comments, video submissions, etc.). By submitting such content, you represent and warrant that:

  * You are the sole author and owner of the intellectual property rights thereto;
  * All “moral rights” that you may have in such content have been voluntarily waived by you;
  * All content that you post is accurate;
  * You permit to Tennis Channel using the content you supply in accordance with Tennis Channel’s terms of use, and that such submission does not violate those terms.



We may collect information when you interact with the Services, for example, when you subscribe to newsletters, participate in competitions or games or other activities on our Services, purchase merchandise, etc. When using the Services, you may be asked to provide various types of personally identifiable information or other information to enhance your experience on the Services.

 _ **Automatic Information Collection**_. We collect information through technology, such as “cookies,” Flash cookies and “Web beacons,” including when you visit our Site and Application or use our Applications on third-party sites or platforms. Cookies (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are small amounts of data which include a unique string of characters sent to your browser or application from a website's computers and stored on your computer's or device's hard drive that help store user preferences and activity. Web beacons (also known as pixel tags, image tags, gif or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. The Services and/or third parties may use cookies, web beacons and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect information automatically as you browse the Services and the web.

We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand the Services and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Services, personalize your experience on the Services(for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Services), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Services and for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional information regarding your visits to the Services (such as your visits to the Site's webpages, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences), may collect such information across multiple sessions on the Services and other websites offered by our affiliates and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Services (“Identifier”). An Identifier is automatically assigned to any Device you use to access the Services. Your personally identifiable information is not collected as part of this process but we may associate anonymous information collected by Tracking Technologies with personally identifiable information. By visiting the Services, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Services through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you.

We may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, “Third Party Advertising Service Providers”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Services, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Services (“Targeting Services”). These Third Party Advertising Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Services and other websites you have visited. Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.

These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Services except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Services. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to information about you.

 _ **Location Data We Collect**_. When you use our Service we may solicit your permission to collect your location data. Please be advised, for some features within our Application to function we must confirm your current location and therefore some features will not be available if you choose not to provide your location data to us. The specificity of the location data collected may depend on a number of factors, including the Device you are using (e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, WiFi, etc.). If you enable location services for our Application, we may collect location data (e.g. zip code) periodically as you use or leave open our Application. We may also use this data internally or in conjunction with our third party service providers to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you. Depending on the platform you use to access our Application you may be able to control from within the settings on your Device or the Application(s) whether location data is collected.

 _ **Social Networking**_. When using our Services or when using certain third party social networking services (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) (each and collectively, a “Social Network”), you may have the option to connect your Services information and activity with your Social Network information and activity and engage with our content on or through the Social Network, plug-ins and application(s). If you authorize such a connection and engage with our content on or through a Social Network, you permit us to share or publish information about your activity on our Services, with that Social Network and its users, and to access certain of your Social Network information (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, your posts or 'likes'), as disclosed by you at the time you consent to the connection, to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application. We may also obtain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on) from your interaction with our content. We may combine information which we obtain through social networking sites or applications with information we obtain directly through the Services or from other sources.

When you allow us to access information from your Social Network account, it can enable us to do things like (1) deliver exclusive content to you, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Application(s) or Site(s), and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly using your contact information. By engaging with our content through social networking sites or applications, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please note that when you provide personal information in publicly visible areas of social networking sites or applications, it may be viewed by other members of these sites and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties.

Please keep in mind that when you provide information to us on a third-party site or platform (for example, via our Application), the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform. The information we collect is covered by this Privacy Policy and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Services. To opt out of information collection by a third-party sites or platform, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies and practices, please refer to such third-party sites’ or platforms’ privacy policies.

We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. Local law may require that you authorize the third party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.
