## Our Commitment to You

TechOnTheNet.com is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. It is important for you to understand what Personal Information we will collect, how we will use it and who may see it.

## What is Personal Information?

Personal Information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
