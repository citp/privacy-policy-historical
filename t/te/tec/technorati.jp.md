# Technorati: Privacy Policy

## Technorati Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy Summary

Technorati endeavors to maintain and protect personally identifiable information about users internally, as spelled out in our privacy policy below. We will only share aggregated statistical information not tied to personally identifiable information with partners and vendors, in order to improve our internal business processes and serve better information to our customers. Please see our specific agreement with users below. 

### Information Collection and Use

Technorati is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Technorati collects information from its users at several different points on its Web site. You can access our Web site home page and browse our site without disclosing your personal data. 

We automatically log personal data by means such as programming or we link information automatically logged by such means with personal data about specific individuals. We use cookies to link information stored in cookies with personal data about specific individuals. We do so to improve the information we present and our other internal business processes. 

We do not collect information about our visitors from other sources, such as public records or bodies, or private organizations. 

### Registration

In order to use the member-only areas of this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (name and email address) and to create a username & password. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. Technorati does not require the user to provide demographic information, such as income level and gender, nor unique identifiers such as social security number. 

### Minor's Privacy

Technorati does not knowingly collect personal data from children as they use the site. Users under 18 who join Technocratic will not have their information displayed. If you would like us to override this, please [contact us](mailto:support@technorati.com) to obtain parent or guardian approval. Read below for more information on the Online Child Protection Act. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a session cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our Web site, unless a member is logged into the site. For instance, by setting a cookie on our Web site, a member user would not have to log in with a password, thereby saving time each time they visit our site. Should the user want to temporarily disable this function they can do so by clicking the log-out link, at which point the login cookie will be deleted. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to view the Members-only areas, like their custom watchlists. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site and improve our internal business processes. 

### Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are linked to personally identifiable information sometimes. 

### Sharing

We do not share membership information about individuals with anyone, except as stated here. Log data is maintained and used for our internal business processes, and this information is shared only in aggregate with our partners and vendors, or as required by law. 

If users choose to display their membership information because they have claimed a blog, their user name, blog(s), blogroll(s), vCard(s), and/or Friend Of A Friend files and member photos will be shown as associated with their blog to other users on the site. Members who do not claim blogs will never have their membership information shown or attached to a blog on the external website. Any member's information outside of these six kinds of information (user name, blog(s), blogroll(s), vCard(s), and/or Friend Of A Friend files and member photos), including other information from the membership form or any emailed information we receive from members, will not be shared outside the company, except as aggregated statistics, or as required by law. We do not share any individual user information with any of our business partners or outside vendors without permission. We may share aggregated statistics with business partners or outside vendors without permission. 

We use a billing processing company to bill users for some goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Billing information will be retained internally by Technorati as required by law. 

### Links

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Technorati, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users, when they leave our site, to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

### Newsletter

If a user wishes to subscribe to any of our newsletters, we ask them to register by providing their contact information (name and email address) and to create a username and password and to opt-in for the newsletter. 

### Choice/Unsubscribe

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' to having their information used for purposes not directly related to our website at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying with unsubscribe in the subject line of the email or by emailing us at [remove@technorati.com](mailto:remove@technorati.com) or by contacting [custservice@technorati.com](mailto:custservice@technorati.com) . 

Users of our Web site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party. 

Technorati reserves the right to remove members. Technorati will notify the deleted member through that user's email address of this action, or will make best efforts to do so, to explain why this action was taken. 

### Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and contact address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used internally for purposes of monitoring or improving use of and satisfaction with this Web site. Survey information will only be shared outside the company in the form of aggregated statistics. 

### Special Offers

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter if they opt-in to this service. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see description of our choice/opt-in policy below. 

### Site and Service Updates

We send the user administrative site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe or opt-out from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user regarding updates to our site and service and issues relating to their account via email (or phone for billing issues). You cannot unsubscribe from administrative service announcements unless you decide to end your membership Technorati. 

### Security and Confidentiality

All our employees and data processors, who have access to, and are associated with the processing of personal data, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of our visitors' personal data. 

We ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed to State institutions and authorities except as required by law or other regulation. 

### Correcting/Updating/Removing Personal Information

Technorati collects traffic data in logs and this information is maintained indefinitely. 

For members (including those using our developer tools): if a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove that member's personal data. Information collected for the membership process, if requested, will be deleted within 7 days from the website. To notify Technorati of a change, you can go to the [Members section](https://web.archive.org/members/index.html) or email Customer Support at [support@technorati.com](mailto:support@technorati.com) . However, some personal information may need to be maintained if it is connected with billing information or as required by law. 

Technorati reserves the right to delete members from the site. Technorati will notify the deleted member through that user's email address of this action, or will make best efforts to do so, to explain why this action was taken. 

### Notification of Changes

Technorati reserves the right to change this privacy policy. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email, with the option to opt-in to the new policy within 30 days. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
