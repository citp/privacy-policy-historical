	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This privacy policy explains how iYogi Inc (“iYogi”) collects, uses and discloses personal and other information iYogi receives in connection with software products, applications, tools, services and user support services we provide to user (the “Services”) in accordance with the Terms of Use (http://www.iyogi.net/terms.html ). When you submit information through our website, email, chat session, and provide it to our technicians over the telephone or, use the Services, you (the “user”) agree to our use of this information consistent with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW IYOGI COLLECTS INFORMATION</b>&nbsp;<br>
We provide software products, applications, and user support services to consumers using web-based tools and software as well as over the telephone. These tools may include software that enables us to remotely access and control a user’s computer with their permission. We require certain information and permissions from you to provide the Services.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some information we collect may be provided by the user directly such as when requested by a form or on the phone by a technician. Other technical information might be collected or accessed by or through our diagnostic and related tools as our computers work with yours to provide the Services.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>TYPES OF INFORMATION IYOGI COLLECTS</b></p>
<p><b><br>
Information You Provide</b></p>
<p><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION:</b><br>
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (“personal information”) or allows us to contact you. In order to use the Services, the user must first typically register or provide certain identifying information. For online registration, we ask you to provide contact details (such as First and Last name, E-mail address, Your landline and cell phone numbers, Postal address, Other Personal identifier etc.). iYogi uses this information to contact you regarding the product and/or services you have requested. This includes re-registration/renewal notifications, special offers, and surveys on improving our Services.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PAYMENT INFORMATION:</b><br>
If you register for the Services, iYogi may collect credit card information, and other payment information. Like many companies, iYogi may use third party payment processing, payment gateways transactions to process and verify credit cards on our behalf. iYogi uses payment information to complete your transactions.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Computer and System Information<br>
 &nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>SUBSCRIBER( USER) COMPUTER INFORMATION:</b><br>
We may also ask for information related to your (user) computer to provide the Service. As examples, this information may include:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>information about the date of purchase of your computer</li>
<li>type of computer</li>
<li>identification number of your computer</li>
<li>make and model of your computer and/or any computer hardware,</li>
<li>software installed or peripherals attached to it,</li>
<li>condition of the computer,</li>
<li>system and registry data about software installations and hardware configurations, and error tracking files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, this information is required to provide personalized technical support to you, and to help us update our support tools and enhance our supported products lists.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>REMOTE ACCESS:</b><br>
While requesting support you may request for the problem to be resolved by enabling iYogi technicians to have access to and take control of your computer. iYogi uses software tools which enable you to grant control of your computer to an iYogi technician remotely</p>
<p>over the Internet. This allows the iYogi technician to diagnose or correct problems without ever coming to the location of your computer.<br>
iYogi does not use the Remote Access software to access and control your computer without your consent and we request that you remain present when our technicians are doing so.<br>
iYogi technicians are trained in the use of this software and we take steps to limit access to confidential or sensitive information stored on user computer or network, avoid deliberate destruction of information on user computers or networks, and help avoid system problems. iYogi maintains specific internal policy and technical controls to limit how and whether our remote access tools may be used to assist you.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>DIAGNOSTIC TOOL:&nbsp;</b><br>
iYogi uses some online diagnostic tools that may collect a wide variety of useful information about the state of a computer system and your applications. This information is communicated to Yogi using security technologies over the Internet. iYogi analyzes this information to help diagnose and solve end-user problems. The iYogi diagnostic application is not designed to collect sensitive information including information such websites visited, e-mail messages, e-mail addresses sent to, passwords, profiles, etc. Use of the Remote Access and Diagnostic applications may be subject to the terms and conditions of the respective software license agreements.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>LIVE HELP SESSION RECORDS:&nbsp;</b><br>
iYogi reserves the right to monitor and record on-line and off-line sessions between users and iYogi technicians for quality control and service-related purposes. Some uses of this type of information include improving the Service, building a support knowledge base and conducting internal market research. We do not correlate session record data used for these purposes with personal information.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>COOKIES:&nbsp;</b><br>
We may use cookies and similar technologies to provide you with more personal service on our website and as you interact with iYogi. Cookies are small pieces of information stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive or on your device. Cookies help us keep track of the preferences you specify.

&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SUPPLEMENTATION OF INFORMATION</b><br>
In order to protect iYogi from fraud and otherwise ensure the integrity of our services and manage risk we may supplement personal information we collect with information we may get from others. For example, in connection with determining creditworthiness, we may use your name and other related information to request a credit report as permitted by law.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>SHARING AND INFORMATION DISCLOSURE</b><br>
We may share aggregated and de-identified information with our partners. This sharing is usually not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person, unless specifically required to allow use of specific widgets within the Services.</p>

<li>To other third parties for purposes you have allowed.</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to retain, use, and disclose aggregate or anonymous information developed from personal information at any time. If we merge with, or are acquired by another company, or sell all or substantially all of our relevant assets, or file for bankruptcy, we may disclose and transfer personal information with the company or asset. We will seek appropriate protection for personal information disclosed or transferred in such transactions consistent with applicable law.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL USERS</b><br>
Because iYogi operates globally, we make information we gather available to our worldwide business units.

No data transmissions, or even the physical transfer of information, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We cannot fully eliminate all security risks associated with personal information and technical mistakes are possible. Therefore, we do not ensure or warrant the security of any data or information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.<br>

<p><b>CORRECTION/UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</b><br>
If a user’s personal information changes (such as user zip code), or if a user no longer desires to use the Service. User may correct, update or remove user personal information provided to us through our website.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
