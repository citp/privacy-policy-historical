 **Other Websites**  
Our website may contain links to other websites that are outside our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you that will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policies which may differ from ours.

 **Use of Cookies**  
This website uses cookies. These cookies hold no personal information whatsoever and are destroyed upon leaving the website. You are free to turn cookies off in your browser, but please be aware that in doing so, you will not be able to access sites with member sections.

 **Third Party Advertising Cookies**  
Most of the advertisements you see on the website are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own cookies (or web beacons) to track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the services of third parties to do this), and to track how many people have seen it more than once. The third party cookies currently being used on our sites are from Google Analytics. These are:

These cookies cannot be used to identify an individual; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated with other anonymous information for statistical purposes. The third party companies that generate these cookies have their own, strict, privacy policies but we don’t have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all. You can visit the trade body representing these advertising companies for more information on how to opt out of these cookies: [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect your Personal Data, but cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Data you disclose online.
