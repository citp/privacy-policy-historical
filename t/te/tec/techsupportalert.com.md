# Tech Support Alert Privacy Policy

**Tech Support Alert   Privacy Policy **

I unconditionally respect the privacy of my newsletter subscribers and site visitors. **This** **is my policy** :

  * ** Usage. ** Email addresses provided by site visitors are used only to mail email newsletters to which visitors subscribe and for no other purpose. They will **never** be used by me for promoting products or any other purpose other than mailing newsletters.

  * ** Email Address Integrity. ** All my subscription lists are double opt-in. That is, subscribers must confirm by email, the subscription address given. This ensures that all my newsletters are specifically requested by the owner of the email address.

  * **Third Party Use.** I do **not** sell, rent, or loan my subscription lists to third parties for any purpose with no exceptions.

  * **Un-subscriptions.** I send my newsletters only to those who request them and immediately un-subscribe those who request it.  Every issue of my newsletters explains how to subscribe  and un-subscribe.

  *  **Security.** I store subscriber email addresses in a secure manner not accessible to Web browsers or off-line.  

  *  **Choice and Consent.** I respect the purpose for which my site visitors give me their email address and other information. I inform users exactly how this information is used and give them choice and consent over this use including the removal of  names immediately upon request.
