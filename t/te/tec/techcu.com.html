        or services they offer may be of interest to you. Examples of third parties

        Union and Tech CU Financial Services, Inc. (including the Car Store) from 
        exchanging information (other than transaction and experience information) 
        about you, by following the instructions in the Opting Out section below. 
        Once a third party has information about you, however, they may continue
