<b>Anonymous TECHNOCASH "digital-cash"</b><br>
</td>

<tr>

We want to provide you with a service that enhances your life, 
your internet shopping experiences, and your personal or business financial transactions, while making sure that your
personal privacy is secure.
<br>
<br>
To this end we have developed our TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" to be anonymous and intrinsically private.
No personal information is collected by Technocash Inc.
We transact using SSL to ensure that your transactions with us and your TECHNOCASH "digital cash" are encrypted. We are capable of 128bit encryption. You should be aware that the local browser often determines a lower level of encryption.
It is the responsibility of the user of TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" to administer this capability. We allow for all users to transact without forcing you to upgrade your software.
<br>
<br>
Of course, for your records we record where each individual piece of "digital-cash" is used: the history attached to each piece of TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" can show details of use. 
You should see your TECHNOCASH "digitial cash" as a mini anonymous account.
<br>
<br>
Using this format provides features which enable and empower you to buy
and sell with confidence. Adding Passwords or even re-issuing a fresh Tcode number (your 16-digit alpha-numeric number) allows for person-to-person escrow services.
<br><br><b>You must only rely on connections to www.technocash.com or secure.technocash.com or  www.technocash.com.au
or secure.technocash.com.au</b> for information on the value and currency of your TECHNOCASH "digital-cash". 
<br><br>
It's none of our business how much you spend, where you spend it, or what you spend it on.
We don't need to know this information to provide our services. 
Without our knowledge, you can send your TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" to others in whole or in part. 
As TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" is transferable, no connection to any one individual can be established.
We simply manage your loose "digital-cash" value and provide transaction verification services.
 You have privacy and security when you use TECHNOCASH. We want anyone to be able to use the net shop 
 and make person to person transfers. 
<br><br>
We won't be marketing to you as an individual if you possess TECHNOCASH "digital-cash".
We keep no records about you the specific TECHNOCASH holder. If you choose to participate in any of our specials or promotions, we may have your contact details for
internal use or the use stated at the time of the special or promotion to which you will have agreed. All other promotional 
and business activities are confidential and are not, and cannot, be linked to your private TECHNOCASH numbers. 
Usually all we will need is an email address to contact you on. In any case, it is our policy to honour the "unsubscribe" 
option to any mailing lists we may have.
<br><br>
Owning a BillFold is somewhat different. For example, a BillFold
allows you to enter and store personal and business information. Indeed, some BillFolds are fully identified: for example, 
Retail BillFolds disclose merchant details so that shoppers can have the peace of mind that they are interacting with a known merchant. 
<br><br>
No club membership is needed for you to enjoy all the features of loose TECHNOCASH "digital-cash" or our site.  
<br><br>
We reserve the right to from time to time inform you of promotional and other offers, whether or not in conjunction with our 
merchants, based on individual TECHNOCASH details such as "remaining value", and to place these offers where appropriate. For example, 
we could offer you the latest special for a $8.95 service/product when your TECHNOCASH has $9.30 left to spend. This is to help you make decisions about where and how
best to spend your "digital cash", and to let you know of any special offers our merchants may be offering. 
An important thing to remember is that we protect your personal information: we do not "mine" any of our data records 
that contain your personal information for on-sale or use by third parties.

<b>Store Branded TECHNOCASH </b><br>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
If you possess store branded "digital-cash" powered by TECHNOCASH, personal information is a matter
 between you and the store providing this "digital-cash" currency.

The store may use and operate services provided by TECHNOCASH, and we treat associated data
as belonging to them and hence as not to be used without their permission.
The store you are dealing with should obtain your permission before using this data.

<b>BillFold (tm)</b>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
The BillFold product is like an account-based system to add and disperse TECHNOCASH "digital-cash", with the
result that the owner can view and handle their cash in various currencies as a lump sum.
Several categories exist, such as Retail Merchant, Technocash Basic Card, Global FX Card, Organisation Card,
Member Cards and Deposit cards.
<br>
<br>
The BillFold system is designed to connect Organizations to its members' BillFolds,
via Messaging systems, payment dispersal systems, and payment
collection. You are not forced to provide
any information, however it is possible to store membership data including name, phone and bank account details,
and certain facilities will require data if they are to operate effectively. Generally the information needed to 
operate the system is determined by our merchants' needs. An organization or retail store may use and operate services 
provided by TECHNOCASH, and we treat associated data 
as belonging entirely to that organization or retail store who are free to access the data and move it about.
This member data will not be used without the organization's permission once we are satisfied they have their
customer's permission.  
Our services are designed to keep account-holders' data attached only to the specific merchants/stores that the account-holder has
dealt with.

As you would expect, certain organizations and regulatory authorities have legal access to our data and we fully 
co-operate with bona fide entities requesting information. These may include the Reserve Banks, State or Federal
police, and other appropriate Government Authorities. We are also required by law to maintain certain minimum
personal details and contact information for some account types. For more information refer to our legal section
