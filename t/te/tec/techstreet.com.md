# Techstreet Security and Privacy Policies

When searching and ordering at Techstreet, you don't have to take risks or give up your personal privacy.  We are committed to maximizing the security of your transactions and keeping your information safe.  Please read on for more details.

**Your Transactions are Protected - Guaranteed**   
All of your transactions are protected using SSL encryption software.  This means that your credit card information, name, address, and e-mail cannot be read as they travel across the Internet.  SSL encryption is the standard for transactional security and it is used by virtually all other e-commerce systems on the Web.

We have NEVER had a customer report fraudulent use of their credit card as a result of ordering at Techstreet.  Because we are so confident of this record, we offer this guarantee:  if you ever experience unauthorized use of your credit card as a result of ordering with Techstreet through our **secure server** , we will reimburse you up to $50, if your bank holds you liable for the charges.

**We Collect Only What We Need**   
We collect certain information to process orders and to make your shopping experience more personal.  In other words, we ask only for what's necessary to allow you to search, order, and browse through the site.  When you place orders with us, we ask for your name, company name, shipping and e-mail address, a contact phone number (just in case), and your credit card number and expiration date (if purchasing with a credit card).  We use this information to process your order and to notify you of your order status.  Furthermore, all of the information we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

**About "Cookies"**   
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.  Cookies allow our server to identify your computer and keep track of the items in your shopping basket.  We also use cookies to remember your shipping and billing address preferences for future orders. You can always turn off your cookies (with a setting in your browser), but you won't be able to order online without them. 

**We Don't Traffic in Names or E-mail**   
Techstreet is not in the business of collecting and selling our customers' information.  We do not sell, trade, or rent names or e-mail addresses to third parties.  The only exception to this rule is when you enter our site from another publisher's e-commerce system (e.g. from an association's Web site like API, NCITS, NISO, etc.).  In this case, we are acting as agents and distributors for the publisher and we provide that information as part of our contract to maintain the publisher's database.

**We are Anti-Spam!**   
We get plenty of it ourselves, so you can be sure we don't send it.  Spam is considered to be indiscriminate e-mail messages sent to just about anyone, anytime.  Sorry, but we discriminate!  In the infrequent cases that you receive e-mail from us (not including order confirmations sent by e-mail), we try to tailor the content to your specific needs.  Our unobtrusive e-mails might contain notices of new features on our site, new publications relevant to your work, and important issues in your industry.  Each message ends with an offer to remove you from our e-mail lists.  At anytime, you can ask not to receive further e-mails by sending a message to [techstreet.service@thomson.com](mailto:techstreet.service@thomson.com) with the subject "remove e-mail".

**Your Permission**   
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of the information by Techstreet.  If we change our privacy or security policies in the future, those changes will be posted here so you always know what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.

We would be happy to explain any of our privacy and security policies to you in person.  If you have any questions or concerns, please call 800-699-9277 or 734-913-3930.
