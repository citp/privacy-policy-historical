# Privacy Policy & Practices

Effective: May 25, 2018 

### 1\. Scope

This Privacy Notice describes how Techstreet ("Techstreet", "we", "us" and "our") collects, uses, shares, secures, and eventually disposes of (collectively "processes") your personal data. Personal data is any information that does, or could, identify you. Your rights over your personal data are set out in **Section 10 - Your rights and choices.**

This Privacy Notice applies to personal data collected by our websites, apps, and products (collectively "services"), and in the course of routine offline business contacts with you. Our services include Techstreet Enterprise, Techstreet Store, and online stores operated jointly with third-party publishers. Techstreet is part of Clarivate Analytics.

### 2\. Changes to this notice

We will update this Notice from time to time, and will communicate material changes to you before they become effective by the best means available to us (for example, by e-mail or via a prominent notice on our website and in our services).

### 3\. Personal data collected

In addition to personal data that you knowingly provide to us (for example, your name, contact details, and credit card), we use standard technologies like web server logs and cookies to collect information about visitors and end-users of our websites and services. You can read more about our use of these technologies in our [Cookie Notice](https://clarivate.com/legal/cookie-policy/). If you seek help with technical issues, you may share information about your devices with us, such as their operating system and installed programs. 

### 4\. Purposes of processing

We process personal data for the purposes listed below. Your relationship with Techstreet will determine which purposes apply to you.

**Customer and product administration**  
To provide you with our services, we use personal data to create product accounts, fulfil purchase orders, provide user and technical support, enforce our business terms, report service usage information to subscribers (Techstreet Enterprise), report to our content providers, contact you about renewal of your subscriptions, and other related administrative tasks.

**Personalized product functionality**  
We use your personal data to deliver personalized functionality in our services, such as your stored searches and document lists.

**Product development**  
We analyze service usage data to inform our product development process, for example to understand which content and tools are most useful for our users. Your product usage information is usually aggregated or "pseudonymized" (delinked from you as an individual).

**Marketing**  
We will send you marketing messages for Clarivate products that may interest you (see **Section 10 - Your rights and choices** for information on managing your marketing preferences). We do not disclose your contact information to third parties for their marketing purposes.

**EU GDPR Article 6 (lawfulness of processing) information**

For individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we process your personal data on the following legal bases: 

**Purpose of processing** | **Legal basis of processing**  
---|---  
**Customer and product administration** | To fulfill our contractual obligations to you, or because we have a legitimate interest in, for example, providing our services to our customers’ organizations or enforcing our terms of business.  
**Personalized product functionality** | To fulfill our contractual obligations to you, or because we have a legitimate interest in providing the service functionalities required by our customers and users.  
**Product development** | Our legitimate interest in assessing and improving our services.  
**Marketing** | Either your consent or, if you are an existing customer, because we have a legitimate interest in keeping you advised of new services.  
  
### 5\. Private-label stores

Techstreet operates online stores with third-party standards publishers ("private-label stores"). Private-label stores are co-branded, usually showing an "In Partnership with Techstreet" message. At these stores, Techstreet and the publisher both collect and use your data ("joint controllers"). If you have questions or requests about the use of your data by a private-label store, you may contact Techstreet (see **Section 11 - Contact us** ).

### 6\. Recipients of the data

Your personal data will, depending on the purposes of processing, be disclosed to different individuals and organizations, including:

  * Techstreet employees and contractors whose roles require access to your data. Our personnel are bound to confidentiality terms which cover their obligations to protect personal data.
  * Other divisions ("affiliates") of Clarivate Analytics that provide support for Techstreet services and business.
  * Techstreet suppliers who process personal data on our behalf ("processors"); for example credit card payment processors and web analytics services like Google Analytics. Such vendors are contractually bound to protect your data to the same standard as set out in this Notice and, in the case of credit card payment processors, to meet the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
  * Your data may be transferred to a third party as a result of any merger, acquisition, or similar corporate event involving Techstreet or Clarivate.
  * We will disclose your personal data when required to by law.



### 7\. Data security

Techstreet maintains appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your personal data from accidental loss and unauthorized access or use. These measures include encryption, firewalls, roles-based data access, intrusion-detection software, and physical access controls to data centers. However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will never occur.

### 8\. Data retention

We store your personal data throughout the period of your relationship with us, and retain it for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying legal, accounting, or reporting obligations or to resolve disputes. For more information on how long we store your data, please contact us at [data.privacy@clarivate.com](mailto:data.privacy@clarivate.com).

### 9\. International transfer

Techstreet and Clarivate are global businesses, and your data will be transferred to countries with different privacy and data protection laws than your own, including to countries, such as the United States, that the European Commission considers not to have adequate data protection laws.

We protect our transfers from the European Economic Area with legal safeguards that include: (1) the existence of a European Commission adequacy decision (covering, for example, transfers to Canada, New Zealand, and Switzerland); (2) Clarivate's Intra-Group Agreement incorporating [Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en) approved by the European Commission; (3) Standard Contractual Clauses and other contract terms executed between Clarivate and a third-party data processor; (4) a third-party processor's certification under the [EU-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome).

### 10\. Your rights and choices

You may at any time ask for access to the data that we hold about you, and request its correction or erasure, or that we cease to process it (see **Section 11 - Contact us** ). For further information on European data protection rights, including your right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority, and your right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your data, visit our [European Data Protection Rights](https://clarivate.com/legal/european-data-protection-rights/) page.

**Marketing** : We would like to send you marketing communications, for example event invitations, white papers, and information about our services that may interest you. We will obtain your prior consent when your local law requires it.

You can opt out of our marketing communications at any time - all Clarivate marketing e-mails contain an unsubscribe link. If you have questions regarding our use of your information for marketing purposes, please contact the [Clarivate Marketing Team.](mailto:news@clarivate.com)

If you purchase or download a publication from a Techstreet "private-label store" (see **Section 5 - Private-label stores** ), you may receive marketing messages from the document publisher. You may need to unsubscribe or manage your preferences directly with the publisher.
