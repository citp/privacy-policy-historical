Publication Date: May01, 2005</b><br> <i>Revised: August 14, 2006</i><br>With Immediate effect, the site policy mentioned hereafter will also apply to the sister website www.funenclave.com. Since this is a change of policy, we request members to take note.
<br> <br>TechEnclave has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: www.techenclave.com and our sister website www.funenclave.com.<br> <br><br><b>
Right to Change Policy    </b> <br>
As TechEnclave is constantly innovating and enhancing the type of services it provides to its users, this Privacy Statement will also continue to change to match the services and features we make available. As such, we reserve the right to change this statement to match the services we provide. If we make any material change to this statement, we will change the date at the top of this statement to reflect the effective date of the change. When you visit our site or use our services and site features, we encourage you to check the date of this Privacy Statement to ensure you are aware of any updates.

However, regardless of how this Privacy Statement may change or evolve over time, TechEnclave will not collect or maintain your private and personally identifiable information without your consent. Further, if you consent to give us your personal information, we will keep it confidential and will not sell, license or disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent, unless we are compelled to do so under the law or to comply with court order.
