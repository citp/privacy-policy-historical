# Privacy Policy

TechOnShow.com takes privacy issues very seriously. Submission of personal information is not required in order to browse the website. We use demographic and traffic information of our users only to analyze the readers community and may also provide it to potential advertisers and business partners. This does not include personal reader information. Submission of this information on TechOnShow.com is always optional and will never be provided to third parties.

To ensure that users email addresses will not get in any bulk mail lists or newsletters, we at TechOnShow modify the addresses so any email collecting scripts will not be able to gather them. Besides that, only in the Forum section of the website it is obligatory for the user to provide an email address in order to complete the registration. The Forum section requires certain user information in order to take full advantage of the software features and authenticity of the user. This information will never be provided to third parties.

Cookies are used for maintaining user information and behaviour on the Forum. These cookies are small files, which are stored on your computer and contain information like your username and your current preferences. You may also receive advertising cookies from our advertisers and affiliate partners. This is a standard practice in the Internet industry. We have no control over these cookies.
