<br>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">Welcome to  TechNewsDaily!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">TechNewsDaily  has created this Privacy Policy in order to set forth the principles  governing our information-gathering and dissemination practices.  TechNewsDaily has a strong commitment to the privacy of our users.  Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to information  collected through TechNewsDaily and not to information collected offline  or to information you may provide to any third-party sites to which  TechNewsDaily may link, except as expressly provided herein.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;  font-family:Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">Information We Collect</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">There are  two kinds of information that TechNewsDaily can obtain about you:  "Anonymous Information" and "Personally Identifiable Information."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">"Anonymous  Information" consists of non-personally-identifiable data, such as your  Internet Protocol ("IP") address or domain, or information about your  usage on TechNewsDaily that is used for administrative purposes only.  For example, an IP address is a unique string of numbers that is  assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers  automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may collect  our users' IP addresses for such purposes as to help diagnose problems  with our servers and to report aggregate information to our advertisers,  corporate affiliates and consultants, and to third parties that perform  particular services on our behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">We may also  use the information linked to IP addresses to ban users who violate our  Terms and Conditions of use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">"Personally  Identifiable Information" is any information that personally identifies  you, such as your name, street address, email address, or telephone  number. We collect such information when, for example, you enter a  contest, subscribe to our email newsletter, and participate in other  interactive online activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">When we  collect Personally Identifiable Information from you, you will have the  opportunity to "opt in" to receive email or other digital communications  from us and/or our business partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">If you have  submitted your personal information to TechNewsDaily, you may correct,  amend or delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained on  file about you if it is incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">In all  cases, we will only use your information as permitted by law.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, however, we  may disclose Personally Identifiable Information to others if we are  required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is  necessary to (a) comply with the law or with legal process; (b) protect  and defend our rights and property; (c) protect against misuse or  unauthorized use of the Site; or (d) protect the personal safety or  property of our users or the public. Please note that we may not provide  you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;  font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">Use of "Cookies"</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">TechNewsDaily  uses "cookies" - data that is transferred from TechNewsDaily to your  hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to deliver  content specific to your interests and to save your password so you do  not have to re-enter it each time you visit TechNewsDaily. Some of the  advertisements appearing on TechNewsDaily are delivered by our  third-party ad network, DoubleClick. In the course of serving  advertisements, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique "cookie" in  your browser's cache, and may use Anonymous Information (including  date/time of the banner ad displayed, the ad that was displayed and the  IP address of the visitor) about your visits to this and other Web sites  in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest  to you and to collect statistical information. For more information  about DoubleClick's privacy policy, </span><a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx"><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">please click  here</span></a><span style="font-family:  Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">. If you would like to "opt out" of  having a unique cookie placed on your hard drive by DoubleClick, </span><a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx"><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">please click  here</span></a><span style="font-family:  Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;  font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">Disclosure of  Information through Business Transfers</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">As we  continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with  other companies or businesses, and in so doing, acquire customer  information. In such transactions, user information may be among the  transferred assets. Similarly, in the event that a portion or all of  TechNewsDaily's assets are sold or transferred to a third party,  customer information (including your email address) would likely be one  of the transferred business assets.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;  font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">Third Party Web Sites</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">TechNewsDaily  contains links to third-party Web sites not owned or controlled by  TechNewsDaily. TechNewsDaily is not responsible for the privacy  practices or the content of such third-party Web sites. Inclusion of any  linked Web site on TechNewsDaily does not imply or express an approval  or endorsement of the linked Web site by us, or of any of the content,  opinions, products or services provided on these Web sites. Even if an  affiliation exists between TechNewsDaily and a third-party Web site, we  exercise no control over linked sites. Each of these linked sites  maintains its own independent privacy and data collection policies and  procedures. If you visit a Web site via a link from one of our Sites, we  encourage you to consult that Web site's privacy policy before  providing any personal information, and whenever interacting with any  such Web site.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;  font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">Security</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">TechNewsDaily  has reasonable security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse  and alteration of the information under our control. Security of  information communicated by or to us over the Internet is of utmost  concern to us; however, no data transmission over the Internet can be  guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that your email, like most, if  not all, unencrypted Internet communications, may potentially be  accessed and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge and  permission, while in transit to us. For that reason, to protect your  privacy, please do not use email to communicate information to us that  you consider confidential. While we strive to protect your personal  information, TechNewsDaily cannot ensure or warrant the security of any  information you transmit to us. Once we receive your transmission, we  will use reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our internal  systems. Depending on the nature of the inquiry, your communication may  be discarded or archived.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;  font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">Policy Regarding Minors</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">Children  should always ask parents before providing any personal information  online. No information should be submitted to or posted on TechNewsDaily  by any minor (a person under 18 years of age) without the consent of a  parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, we do  not knowingly provide any Personally Identifiable Information about  minors, regardless of its source, nor is this information knowingly used  by TechNewsDaily for any marketing or promotional purposes. Minors are  not eligible to participate in contests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">TechNewsDaily  abides by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. In the event  that we learn that we have collected information from any child under  the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete  this information from our database as quickly as reasonably possible. If  you believe that any Site has collected any information about anyone  under 13, please contact TechNewsDaily's Site Administrator via postal  mail or email at one of the addresses listed below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;  font-family: Arial,Verdana,Helvetica,sans-serif">Limitation of Liability </span></strong></p>
