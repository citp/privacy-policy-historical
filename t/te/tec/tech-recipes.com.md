For example, we will know how many people visit this page each day; however, we will not know the specific user name, email address, or any personal information about those visits.

No personally identifiable information including email addresses or the data a user records into the “Personal Information” or “Profile Information” sections will ever be sold or distributed. Information placed into these areas can be viewed by the public; the user may or may not choose to input data into this area. The user has the ability to hide his/her email address and online status from the public. Users often provide this information to help integrate themselves within the Tech-Recipes community.
