**6\. Who are the recipients of your personal information**

While fulfilling our contractual or legal obligations your personal information may be conveyed to our partners and subcontractors. These providers and suppliers are in contract with Techjoomla with which they are obliged to uphold the confidentiality and protection of your personal information in accordance to the local data protection laws and the GDPR.

The recipients of your personal information are as follows.

  1. PayPal (Europe) S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A. 5th Floor, 22-24 Boulevard Royal, Luxembourg, 2449, LUXEMBOURG. They process payment for us.

  3. Google, Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Provides analytics for our site. Only anonymized information is sent to Google. Evan as such, it's unclear whether they should be listed as a data processor.

  4. MailChimp, which is a service provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.

**7\. Use of your personal information for communication**

We don’t use your personal information for any marketing purposes. If we want to make a marketing campaign which includes your personally identifiable information, we will seek your consent for the same. In this case, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Any processing taking place or marketing campaigns launched before your consent withdrawal shall not be affected.

**8\. How long do we keep your personal information**

We retain your personal information for as long as we have a business relationship with you as evidenced by the existence of an active subscription or a login to your account.

We are legally required to retain your invoicing information, both as an off-line backup and in the custody of our auditors, for a period of up to TEN (10) years after your purchase.

Other logs which may contain personal information such as server access logs and security logs are kept for up to twenty-four (24) months.

We may retain your personal information longer than that for regulatory, technical or legal reasons.

Your information may be stored longer than that in encrypted backups. However, we have measures in place to remove your PII upon restoring those backups  _unless otherwise legally required, e.g. in assisting a criminal investigation_.

**9\. Your data protection rights**

You have the following rights with regards to the personally identifiable information we keep on file for you:

  * Access your personal information.
  * Request the correction of the personal information we keep on you.
  * Ask for the deletion of your personal information
  * Ask for a copy of the personal information pertaining to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, to convey this information to other organizations. You may also request that we directly convey that file to another organization of your choice. This is also known as "data portability right".
  * Withdraw your consent regarding the processing of your personal information at any time. Please note that withdrawal of your consent at any time does not invalidate the legality of the processing based on your consent before that was revoked or withdrawn by you.



**10\. Changes in this Privacy Statement**

From time to time, we may modify the privacy statement. When this happens we will keep you updated with a highlighted text at the top of the page.
