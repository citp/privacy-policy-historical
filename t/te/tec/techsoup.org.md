# TechSoup - The Technology Place for Nonprofits

  
This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for TechSoup.org. TechSoup.org is a project of [CompuMentor](http://www.compumentor.org/). 

**Information Collection and Use**  
TechSoup.org is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. TechSoup.org collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

**My TechSoup Registration**  
In order to use some features of this Web site (My TechSoup), a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the topics on our site for which they have expressed interest and for the user to receive their lost password. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (mailing address, position, technical skill, etc.). 

**Cookies**  
Techsoup.org uses cookies to remember if a user has logged in while he/she is on our site. This allows My TechSoup users to avoid logging in more than once, thereby saving time. Users have the option of disabling or not accepting cookies by changing the preferences on their browsers*. If a user opts not to enable cookies, he/she will still be able to use our Web site. However, he/she will not be able to use the My TechSoup functionality or post to the TechSoup message boards. No personally indentifiable information (email address, name, etc.) is collected with the cookies that we set, and accepting cookies while on the TechSoup.org site will not put the user at risk for marketing to other sites. 

*Different browsers have different cookie-settings. With Netscape you can ask the browser to allow, warn you, or completely disable cookies. Internet Explorer has an additional feature where you can specify different settings for different security zones. You can choose to allow Web sites to create cookies for you in your "trusted sites" (like TechSoup.org), to warn you before you create them in your local Intranet zone, and to give you an option to never allow them in a "restricted zone." See the "Help" section of your particular browser for more information on working with cookies. 

**Web Statistics**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use for reporting and sponsorship purposes. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners, sponsors, and donors. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We only share this information so that we can secure funding to continue providing this site free of charge. 

**Links**  
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that TechSoup.org does not claim any responsibility for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Security**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information, and we have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. 

**Newsletter - By The Cup**  
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter (By The Cup), we ask for an email address only. We do not keep track of names or other personal information, and the list is stored locally. 

You can subscribe or unsubscribe from By The Cup online at:   
[http://www.techsoup.org/sub_btc.cfm](https://web.archive.org/sub_btc.cfm)

You can also subscribe or unsubscribe by sending an email to:   
[lists@compumentor.org](mailto:lists@compumentor.org)

With the following text (minus the quotes) in the subject of the email:   
" **unsubscribe by-the-cup** " 

**Surveys**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via Web surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include demographic information (such as zip code, age level), but no information that can identify any individual person will be collected. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Send This to a Friend**  
If a user elects to use our "Send this to a friend" function, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. TechSoup.org will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. TechSoup.org stores this information temporarily for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. 

**Updates**  
We may also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code or email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove that user's personal data provided to us. Users can use the "Edit My Profile" link from their [My TechSoup homepage](https://web.archive.org/mts_homepage.cfm) or they can email our Help Desk ([help@techsoup.org](mailto:help@techsoup.org)) to change, correct, or remove information. 

**Choice/Opt-in**  
Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-in" to newsletters and site update emails. For example, our My TechSoup form has checkboxes that let users choose which topic(s) they would like to receive email updates on. Likewise, By The Cup is an "opt-in" newsletter. Originally, we sent By The Cup to CompuMentor's mentor and organization mailing list, but we no longer will subscribe anyone automatically. To unsubscribe from By The Cup, please see that section above. To unsubscribe from any updates, users can use the "edit my profile" link from their [My TechSoup homepage](https://web.archive.org/mts_homepage.cfm). To avoid receiving certain topic updates, the user can simply deselect the topics, and hit the "modify" button. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

**Questions or Comments**  
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact:
