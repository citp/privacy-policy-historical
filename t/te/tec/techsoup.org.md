We have have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the information we collect from users of our websites, including http://www.techsoup.org/ (collectively, the "Web Sites") and online services (the "Services").

## Definitions

"Account" means information a My TechSoup Profile account.

Therefore, while TechSoup Global uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. (Please see our Terms of Use for more information.)

## Personal Information We Collect

We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily. For example:

  * When you create an Account, we will collect your name, the username and password that you choose, the primary email address you provide to us, and any other information you choose to affiliate with your Account. 
  * When you enter any information, including Personal Information, into any posting or comments within the Services, we will collect such information.

  * When you leave us feedback or request support, we will collect any information that is contained in your feedback or support request.

In addition to their name, title, and email address, TechSoup Clients are also required to provide us with their organization's name, type, mission, budget, and contact information. TechSoup Global retains this information so that it can track donation requests to completion, facilitate customer-service requests, and inform clients of important changes to programs that may affect them.

From time to time, TechSoup Global receives Personal Information about you via offline sources like telephone or fax. We may use this in combination with information collected online in order to improve the services we provide.

## Data You Submit About Third Parties

If you choose to use the "Tell a Friend" function on the Web Sites, or if you choose to refer a nonprofit entity to us, we may collect the information you provide about such third party, such as the third party's name and email address. We may retain and use the information you provide about such third party in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect via Technology

As is true of most websites, our Web server software automatically logs information provided by your network connection and Web browser software, including the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your network connection and the type of Web browser and operating system that you are using. Our Web server may also log the URL of the file that you are requesting, the current date and time, and the URL of the last Web page requested by your Web browser. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Web Sites, track users' movements around the Web Sites, and better tailor our Web Sites to our users' needs.

Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). This type of information is collected to make the Web Sites more useful to and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interest and needs.

We may utilize Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses cookies and page tags to gather information relating to the usage of our Web Sites, such as how often users visit the Web Sites, what pages they visit and other sites they used prior to coming to the Web Sites. The information generated by cookies (including IP addresses) and page tags is transmitted to and stored on Google servers. This information may then be analyzed and compiled into reports on Web Site activity. The use and disclosure of information stored on Google servers is governed by Google's privacy policy available at: <https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/>, not ours.

You have the option of disabling or not accepting cookies by changing the preferences in your Web browser. Consult your Web browser's technical information for details on how to disable cookies. If you opt to disable cookies, you will still be able to access our Web Sites. However, you will not be able to use certain features of the Web Sites, including, but not limited to, the My TechSoup functionality, posting to the TechSoup Global message boards (Community Discussion Forums), and placing requests for Products through the Web Sites.

## Donation Requests Made Through Our Site

Online selection and fulfillment services for Products may be conducted either by us, the donor, or by one of our third party partners. You acknowledge and agree that, in some cases, you may be required to leave our Web Sites to select Products and place your Product request. Our third party partners will make available to you their website policies governing their collection of Personal Information from you. Any Personal Information you provide to such third parties will be subject to the third party's privacy policy and website terms of use, and not to this Privacy Policy or the TechSoup Terms of Use.

## Use of Information We Collect

In general, we use Personal Information you submit to us to provide the Services to you, respond to requests you make, improve the Services, and offer you additional information, opportunities, and functionality. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with updates about the Services.

If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any purpose, provided we will not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information contained in such communication and will treat any Personal Information included in such communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the Personal Information personally identifiable to you. We may use and disclose Anonymous Information in our discretion and without restriction.

## Disclosing Information to Third Parties

We may share Anonymous Information with our partners, sponsors, and donors. For example, we may share Anonymous Information about individual organizations where it is necessary to secure funding to ensure the continued availability of our services or to develop outreach programs with our partners. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose to or share your Personal Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so. 

TechSoup Global may also share your information with third party service providers: to provide you with the Services that we offer you through our Web Sites; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical support; and/or provide other services to TechSoup Global. These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by TechSoup Global.

We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our affiliates and will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy when dealing with any Personal Information shared by TechSoup. 

We may share some or all of your Personal Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

We may (and you authorize us to) disclose Personal Information we collect from you if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us, (b) enforce any agreement we may have entered into with you and to enforce the Privacy Policy, or (c) protect and defend the rights or property of TechSoup Global, other users of the Web Sites, or third parties.

TechSoup Global may enter into agreements with third parties to provide certain donations to our TechSoup Clients or companies that offer their products and/or services on our website ("Third Party Companies"). A Third Party Company may want access to Personal Data that we collect from its customers. 

**AS A RESULT, WE MAY PROVIDE YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO THIRD PARTY COMPANIES. BECAUSE WE DO NOT CONTROL THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OF THESE THIRD PARTY COMPANIES, YOU SHOULD READ AND UNDERSTAND THEIR PRIVACY POLICIES.**

**NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS – YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS**

You may also occasionally receive administrative site and service announcement updates via email (such as, but not limited to, notice that we have changed the Services, Terms of Use, or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it necessary to do so. You may not opt out from these announcements, which are not promotional in nature, as they contain important information about changes to our Services, Terms of Use, or the Privacy Policy. However, if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to cancel your Account(s). You understand that any such termination of your Account information may involve deletion of your Personal Information from our live databases. We will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your Account or related deletion of your information. Note that in some cases, you may request that we delete your Personal Information, but we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).
