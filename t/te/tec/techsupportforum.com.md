# Tech Support Forum

This is a privacy policy for Tech Support Forum. Tech Support Forum respects your privacy. Below is an outline of the information that Tech Support Forum gathers, how it’s used, and how you can “opt-out” or be removed from the site. 

We collect the same standard stuff: the type of browser you are using, your IP address, time, date, pages viewed, and length of time that you spend visiting our site.  We use this information internally to help make the site better for all.  This allows us to see what areas are performing better then others.

The email addresses collected from subscriptions to the Tech Support Forum newsletters are not sold, or disclosed to any third parties. These addresses will only be used by our business to send out Tech Support Forum communications (for example, the Tech Support Forum newsletters). You will not receive any mailings you did not request. You can remove yourself at any time. Your email address will not be disclosed to any third party. The email address will only be seen by moderators and administrators.

Cookies are a technology which can be used to provide you with tailored information from a Website. A cookie is an element of data that a Website can send to your browser, and which your browser may then store on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Doing this will allow you to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept cookies or not.

Cookies on this site are used by ourselves, our ad management system, and occasionally by advertisers who use 3rd party ad serving solutions. Third party privacy policies are different from ours, most likely.

Information collected in this process can also be used to prevent banned users from re-registering under a different username. Cookies may be sent to your browser to enable automatic log-ins upon further visits, as well as for content customization.

When a contest/sweepstakes/survey is run on this site you may be asked to supply some personally identifying information like your name, email address and/or phone number. This information will only be used to notify winners of the contest/sweepstakes. Non-identifying information may be analyzed, aggregated and presented to third-parties to provide an overview of the demographics of our Network's visitors.

Any data collected will be used by ourselves and our agents. Tech Support Forum hereby reserves the right to transfer any data collected in the event of an acquisition, full or partial, of the company or its assets.

When a survey appears on the Tech Support Forum, information is collected, compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. Tech Support Forum may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners.

This information is kept on a secure dedicated server hosted by Liquid Web as well as servers within the Tech Support Forum offices.
