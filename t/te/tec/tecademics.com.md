Tecademics created this Privacy Policy to give you confidence as you visit and use the Websites, and to demonstrate its commitment to fair information practices and to the protection of privacy.

We recognize that the privacy of your personal information is important. The purpose of this policy is to let you know how we handle the information collected through the use of this website.

This website is intended for a United States audience. Any information you provide, including any personal information, will be transferred to and processed by a computer server located within the United States.

This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Websites and not to any Third-Party websites, which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. For additional information, see the section concerning Third-Party Websites, below.

**SHARING INFORMATION**

Except under the following circumstances and otherwise as set forth in this Privacy Policy, Tecademics will only share your personal information with third parties as outlined in this policy and as otherwise permitted by law.

We may share personal information if all or part of the Company is sold, merged, dissolved, acquired, or in a similar transaction.

We may share personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation. We may cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating and prosecuting activities that are illegal, violate our rules, or may be harmful to other visitors.

If you submit information or a posting to a chat room, bulletin board, or similar “chat” related portion of this Website, the information you submit along with your screen name will be visible to all visitors, and such visitors may share with others. Therefore, please be thoughtful in what you write and understand that this information may become public.

We may also share personal information with other third party companies that we collaborate with or hire to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire a company to help us send and manage email, and we might provide the company with your email address and certain other information in order for them to send you an email message on our behalf. Similarly, we may hire companies to host or operate some of our Websites and related computers and software applications.

Tecademics discloses personal information to those who help it provide services, including those who perform technical, administrative and data processing tasks such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, and data storage and security, when required by law or to protect rights. Tecademics discloses personal information in response to a subpoena or court order, or when Tecademics believes in its sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tecademics.

When legally required by law enforcement, judicial and administrative agency disclosures, Tecademics will provide confidential and personally identifiable information as necessary to comply with judicial and administrative orders, subpoenas, civil or criminal investigative demands, administrative and regulatory demands and other legal obligations. In order for Tecademics to conduct business in certain jurisdictions, Tecademics must disclose certain personally identifiable and confidential information to regulatory authorities in such jurisdictions. Such information may include, but is not limited to, income information and personally identifiable information.

Tecademics reserves the right to transfer all personal information in its possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Tecademics’ assets. Other than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred personal information will be subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and opportunity to affirmatively opt-out of it.

Personal information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by Tecademics’ successor organization, if any.

If you have failed to pay any balance owed in consideration of products or services, Tecademics may, as permitted by law, report your personal information, including without limitation, your unpaid balance, to consumer credit reporting services, collection agencies and others.

Tecademics occasionally may assign prospective sales and new independent contractors leads to independent contractors. In these cases, Tecademics will provide the lead with the appropriate independent contractors name and contact information. In addition, Tecademics may have an Independent Contractor Locator feature on its Website. Pursuant to this feature, a prospective customer or new independent contractor can locate a nearby Tecademics independent contractor. In order to make the Independent Contractor Locator feature and the lead assignments effective, the Company will provide the prospective customer or new independent contractor with the independent contractor’s name and contact information, which may include his/her telephone number, address, and/or email address.

To help independent contractors in Tecademics’ affiliate marketing program manage their independent businesses, we may provide your sponsor and other up-line independent contractors with your name, address, telephone number, and email address, as well as data relating to your sales and recruitment activity through the back office to the Website.

**COMMUNICATIONS FROM US**

When enrolling as an independent contractor, registering as registered customer, or making a purchase or other inquiry through the Website, you consent to receive periodic email and other communications from us and from Tecademics independent contractors. For example, Tecademics sends all new independent contractors and registered customers a welcoming email to verify password, username, and acceptance of the Independent Contractor’s Agreement or Customer Agreement. All independent contractors and registered customers will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Customers who have not registered with Tecademics and who grant permission will also receive occasional information on products, services, special deals, and the like.

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send independent contractors or customers an email. Generally, independent contractors may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their accounts. These communications are not promotional in nature.

Tecademics communicates with independent contractors and registered customers via email, regular mail and telephone on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their Tecademics business. Tecademics communicates with other customers with respect to products or services purchased by such customers from Tecademics. Such communications may be by email, regular mail or telephone.
