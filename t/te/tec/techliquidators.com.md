We may permit third party service providers to collect and process some information from our digital properties. We may share personal information with those providers and may have similar arrangements with interest-based advertisers. We provide more information about interest-based ads below.

Our digital properties are not designed to respond to "do not track" requests from browsers.

#### **Location information**

Some of our digital properties may collect your location to help you search for one of our stores or to use special mobile features within some of our stores. For example, Best Buy works with third parties to provide you helpful messaging in your mobile app when you come to our stores.

In order for any mobile application to identify your location, you must enable location services through your mobile device's settings. If you do not want Best Buy to collect this information or to enable these features, you can turn off location services on your mobile device. Best Buy has no control over your device's settings.

#### Store cameras

Our stores may use cameras for asset protection and other operational purposes, such as measuring traffic patterns and protecting and improving our business.

Sometimes we may be required to share personal information for legal reasons, for example, if we are required to do so by a regulation, court order, subpoena or other legal process. We may also share information when we believe it's necessary to comply with the law or to respond to a government request, or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect Best Buy, our customers, or others.

  * We use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information under our control and appropriately limit access to it. 
  * Our digital properties use encryption technology to protect your personal information.



We are committed to protecting your information, but you can do your part. You should create a strong password and protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer and do not share your password with anyone. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and by using our digital properties you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.

  * Stop receiving marketing or promotional e-mails, direct mail, phone, and mobile marketing communications
  * Update and correct your personal information
  * Deactivate your account
