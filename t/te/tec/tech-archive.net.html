<h1 align="center">Privacy Policy Statement</h1><br>

<h3>What Information is collected?</h3>
We maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. We do not link IP addresses to personal information. In general, we only use log files to monitor traffic on our Web sites and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of abuse, however, we may block certain IP addresses.

<h3>Email Correspondence</h3>
We may respond to email sent directly to us. The sender's e-mail address is not shared with third parties and would only rarely be used for one time correspondence with that user. These e-mails are kept internally for our own day to day business purposes.
<br>
We do not maintain e-mail lists nor market via e-mail.

<h3>Cookies &amp; IP Addresses</h3>
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our ad server, or individual advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.<br>
<br>
Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. There are many sources for additional information about Internet cookies, and we encourage anyone concerned about the use of cookies to do more research on the topic so you can make an informed decision about accepting them from any site. As technology advances and cookies provide more functionality, we expect to utilize them in different ways.
<br><br>
IP Address: An Internet Protocol (IP) address is unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information. The IP address is not tied to any personally identifiable information.

<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
To try and bring you offers that are of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages.<br>
<br>
As a result of your visit to our site, ad server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream information.
