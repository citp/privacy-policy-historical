# Our Privacy Policy

We consider your privacy to be of paramount importance.

## Your contact details are safe with us

## We don't pester you

Very occasionally, we may send you some information about our products or a partner's product or about special offers. As at October 2011, this has happened _way less than_ once a year. 

If you register on our [forums](http://www.tectite.com/vbforums/index.php), they perform some automated tasks which involve emailing you. You can adjust your user profile to prevent these activities. 

## Update notices

Some of our products (in particular, FormMail) regularly check our server for updates. When a newer version is found, it will attempt to email you regarding the new version. 

Note that in the case of FormMail, it is **your server** sending you email - we have no involvement in the process. 

These update checks are entirely automated, and we have no direct control over them. We also don't receive any information about who is performing an update check (other than our normal web server logs). 

You can [switch off these update checks](https://web.archive.org/fmdoc/check_for_new_version.php?WWWTECTITE=8frpmhg7is0o6ri1sfvd3ru7c6). 

We don't like spam and we actively fight spammers!  We will _never_ give your contact details to anyone else.

We do not share our customer lists or user lists with anyone. 

## We oppose spam!

We don't purchase lists of email addresses, and we don't use automated bulk-mail software programs. 

Our free [FormMail](https://web.archive.org/formmailpage.php?WWWTECTITE=8frpmhg7is0o6ri1sfvd3ru7c6) product actively fights spam on the Internet. 

## Your privacy and our forums

Our forums are specifically setup to prevent other users from accessing your email address. 

There is a [Private Message](http://www.tectite.com/vbforums/private.php) system so that forum users can communicate with each other in private, but they can do that only via the forums, not by using email addresses. Again, you can disable this feature. 

## If you don't want us to contact you...

We won't. Simply [tell us](mailto:salestaff@tectite.com?subject=No%C2%A0more%C2%A0email) you don't want us to email you and we won't. We'll immediately update our CRM to ensure we never send you an email again. (We'll send you one more email to confirm to you that we've complied with your request.)

## Website cookies

Our main site uses cookies as part of its PHP session processing. These cookies allow it to keep track of some activities to assist you in navigating our site. 

For example, when you search our site, the PHP session (identified by a cookie in your browser) remembers what you searched for so it can highlight these items on the pages you visit. 

Our forums also use cookies to automatically log you in when you visit next time. 

None of the cookies store personally-identifiable information about you. None of our cookies are shared with other sites, except as noted below. 

## Advertising cookies

We also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit some parts of our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/pdfs/NAI_principles.pdf). 

In most cases where we display ads, we use Google ads: 

  * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.
  * Google's use of the [DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) enables it to serve ads based on your visits to our site and to other sites on the Internet.
  * You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).
