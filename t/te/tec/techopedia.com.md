## Cookies

Techopedia.com, like many websites, uses cookies. A cookie is a file containing a string of code text that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox) to connect to Techopedia.com, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables Techopedia.com to present you with custom web pages and options. For example, instead of seeing a generic welcome page, you might see a welcome page with your site username on it and information about products or services that reflect your interests. 

You can set up your browser to reject cookies or tell you when a cookie has been sent. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of Techopedia.com features and are required for the use of the Site. We hope you will leave them turned on. 

In addition to our cookies, Techopedia.com may allow third parties that show advertisements on our site or participate in co-registration to set and access their own cookies on your computer. The cookies inserted by those third parties are not covered by Techopedia.com Privacy Policy, but rather by the policies of those third parties. However, these third parties do not have access to Techopedia.com cookies. 

Techopedia.com also uses Web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to allow us to count how many people have visited a certain page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Techopedia.com website. Additionally, we sometimes use Web beacons to access Techopedia.com cookies inside and outside our Web pages and in connection with Techopedia.com products and services. A Web beacon is a transparent image placed on a Web page that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Techopedia.com website. We may also use Web beacons in connection with emails sent to Techopedia.com users to let us know whether and when the email was opened. 

We do link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

## Third-Party Ad Serving

We send to your Web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use our network of websites. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our Web pages. Because your Web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Website, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a Web page from the site. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience it is trying to reach. As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you. 

We also use third-party ad servers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to Techopedia.com, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a Web beacon or pixel tag, which is industry standard technology, used by most major websites. 

## Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers

If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you must visit each ad network's website individually and opt out. 

## Editing and/or Deleting Account Information and Preferences
