If a user wishes to subscribe to any newsletter(s), we ask for personal and demographic information such as name and e-mail address. If the user indicates they are under 13 then their personally identifiable information will automatically be removed from the site’s database and will not be retained by the site. 

You can unsubscribe from our newsletters and for some of our Partner newsletters using the same interactive process as subscribing, however not all our Partner newsletters have this option. To unsubscribe from those that do not, please follow the instructions provided by each Publisher within the body of their newsletter. There can be a delay of up to 1 week before all subscribe or unsubscribe requests are completed. 

Through our web site, users may also subscribe to promotional newsletters from PostMasterDirect.

When users sign up for promotional email from Postmaster Direct through our web site, they have the ability to opt out of receiving third-party promotional email prior to receiving such mail from Postmaster Direct. 

Publishers of newsletters listed on the FreeTechMail.org site benefit from traffic sent from other sites. Visitors can sign up to e-newsletters from a compilation of contributing publisher newsletters. All new subscription orders along with the subscribers email address are automatically sent to the host site database of the newsletter.
