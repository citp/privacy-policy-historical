##  Information Collected for Tracking and Customization (Cookies)

A cookie is a small file that a website transfers to your computer to allow it to remember specific information about your session while you are connected. Your computer will only share the information in the cookie with the website that provided it, and no other website can request it. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent.

  1. Session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.
  2. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for longer periods of time.



TechShu website may use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through the site, or to allow you to customize your preferences. A few SFC sites may also make use of persistent cookies to remember you between visits so, for example, you can save your customized preference settings for future visits. At no time is your private information, whether stored in persistent cookies or elsewhere, shared with third parties who have no right to that information. If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can turn them off in your browser. However, this may affect the functioning of TechShu website.

##  Personal Information

TechShu sometimes gathers personal information from its users via certain methods. Some of the methods for instance are the user completing a form or sending us an e-mail. If you choose to provide us with personal information, we will use that information only to respond to your message and to help us give you the information or services you have requested for. Remember that e-mail isn’t necessarily secure. You should never send sensitive or personal information like your Social Security number or your Credit Card number in an e-mail. Use postal mail or secure websites instead. Some of our websites ask visitors who request specific information to fill out a registration form. For instance, vendors visiting our TechShu Acquisition Internet Service site for marketing opportunities may be asked to register to obtain e-mail notices for business opportunities. Other information collected at websites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means, enables us to determine visitor’s interests, with the goal of providing better service to our customers.

##  Children’s Information

The Children’s On-line Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathering online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a children’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under the age of 13. We collect no information about you or your child, other than that detailed in the previous section, when you visit our web site unless you choose to provide information to us. When TechShu Website needs to collect information about a child under 13 years old, COPPA required information and instructions will be provided by the specific Web page that collects information about the child. The Web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept. There are several exceptions that permit collection of a children’s e-mail address without receiving parental consent in advance: To provide the parents with notice and to seek consent for communications with the child.

**Note:** this may require collection of the parent’s e-mail address as well. To respond to a one time request from a child. To respond more than once to a children’s request; i.e., subscription to a newsletter. However, parental consent is required prior to the second communication:

  1. To protect the safety of a child who is participating on the site; i.e., in a chat room;
  2. To protect the site or to respond to law enforcement; i.e., in the case of a Web site compromise.



Personal information about children under 13 years of age may be needed to respond to his/her communication to us, such as to receive a poster or to acquire information for a school project. Personal information about your child will be destroyed immediately upon completion of its intended purpose. On rare occasions, it may be determined that a communication from a child under 13 years old should be maintained for historical purposes. Should such an occasion occur, TechShu will obtain the necessary consent from the children’s parent. Finally, we provide many on-line tools and services in support of TechShu’s mission. A child under 13 years old may inadvertently provide personal information to one of these services. If this should happen, the information about the child will be deleted immediately upon discovery.
