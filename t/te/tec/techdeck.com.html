    X-CONCEPTS, LLC ("X-CONCEPTS" or "TECHDECK.COM"), who owns and operates the website 
    currently located at www.techdeck.com  ("Site"), believes that safeguarding your 
    privacy is serious business. Please take a minute to read the following privacy 
    policy ("Policy") so that you understand how we treat your personal information. The 
    purpose of this Policy is to help you understand what kinds of personally 
    identifiable information we may gather about you when you visit the Site, how we may 
    use that information, whether we will disclose it and how you can correct that 
    information. As we modify and expand our services, this Policy might change, so 
    please review it periodically. You can tell if the Policy has been modified since you 
    last reviewed it by checking the date at the beginning of the Policy.  By signing up 
    to be a TECHDECK.COM member ("Member") or using the Site or any of TECHDECK.COM's 
    services offered on the Site, you agree to these terms.  If you have questions about 
    the Policy, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:info@techdeck.com">info@techdeck.com
    </a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">

    You should be aware that our advertisers or websites that have links on our Site may 
    collect personally identifiable information about you. We are not responsible for the 
    actions or policies of such websites and the Policy does not address the information 
    practices of those websites or advertisers.  Your use of the Site is governed by our 
    <a href="TOS.htm">Terms of Use</a> and by other published rules pertaining to 
    particular products and services offered through the Site.</font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">
 
    </font></p><ol><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">
    <b></b><li><b>What personally identifying information about me is collected and who collects 
    it?</b><p>

    Personally identifying information, or personal information, means your name, home or 
    other address, e-mail address, telephone number, birthday, interests or any other 
    information that tells another person who you are when you volunteer this information.  
    We may request and collect such information in the course of providing services on 
    the Site, e.g., when you register to become a Member.  Other information, such as 
    your account status and choice of services, is created and maintained by the Site in 
    the normal course of providing service to our Members and other users. Your personal 
    information may be collected when you contribute an article, video or other feature 
    for the Site in order for us to credit you by name and ensure compliance with the 
    Site's <a href="TOS.htm">Terms of Use</a>.  Your personal information may also be 
    collected when you make purchases, participate in surveys or polls, or respond to 
    special offers, give aways or promotions on the Site.  In addition, the Site may 
    store your electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the 
    transmission and delivery of those communications and to prevent misuse of our e-mail 
    service.</p><p>

    Please note: Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on message boards, 
    in e-mails, or in chat areas on the Site, that information can be collected and used 
    by others. If you post personal information in public places, others may send you 
    unsolicited e-mail messages. Always be cautious about the information you provide 
    online.</p><p>

    <b></b></p></li><li><b>What are cookies and how do we use them?</b><p>

    In our effort to provide services customized to Members' interests, we use cookies to 
    keep and sometimes track information, such as which pages of the Site were visited, 
    which website links were clicked and so on.  A cookie is a small piece of data 
    containing identifying information such as your login name that is sent to your 
    browser from a web server, stored on your computer's hard drive and used to track 
    pages that the user has visited.  We may use cookies to access your account 
    information (stored on our computers), to estimate our audience size for our 
    advertisers, to identify which areas of our Site you have visited, and for other 
    purposes in order to deliver better and more personalized services.</p><p>
 
    You should also be aware that companies that advertise on our Site may use their own 
    cookies. This Policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies.</p><p>
 
    <b></b></p></li><li><b>How is my personal information used?</b><p>
    Our primary goal in gathering your personal information is to provide our Members with 
    a personalized experience.  If we choose to customize content, we may compare your 
    profile with other Member profiles and, based on their interests, we may make 
    predictions about your interests. Based on these predictions, you may see specialized 
    content, including advertising banners. We will not give advertisers direct access 
    to any of your personal identification information.</p><p>

    In addition, we (or those acting on our behalf) may send you e-mail notices about 
    products, companies, and events that we think might interest you.</p><p>

    We also may match information obtained from cookies with data provided by you for 
    internal purposes only.  This allows us to analyze this data both in the aggregate 
    (for example, nine-tenths of our users own miniature skateboards) and in connection 
    with individual users (for example, John Doe visits the Collector's Page the most). 
    This information lets us tailor our services to your interests.</p><p>

    We also reserve the right to provide analyses of our users as a group to prospective 
    partners, advertisers, and other third parties. We do this, without revealing your 
    identity, so that we and our advertisers can better understand your needs and 
    interests, which allows us to keep bringing you advertisements that match your 
    interests.</p><p>
 
    In addition to using personal information collected on the Site in order to provide 
    services to Members, we may disclose personal information to third parties as 
    provided below: (a) when we are required to do so by law; (b) when we have reason 
    to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or 
    property or that of other Site users or anyone else; (c) to respond to an emergency; 
    (d) if you have given us permission to do so, for example, by voluntarily 
    participating in a promotion or making a purchase on the Site (where we then provide 
    the information required to register for the promotion, or to ship your purchases, 
    to the appropriate third-party service provider); and (e) with our contractors, 
    consultants, or professional advisors, but only to the extent necessary for them to 
    perform services on our behalf, and only under reasonable confidentiality 
    restrictions.</p><p>

    <b></b></p></li><li><b>Opting Out.</b><p>

    As part of the Member registration process you may opt out of receiving periodic 
    e-mail messages about products, companies and events by simply telling us that when 
    you give us your personal information. Or, you can easily edit your Member Profile or 
    "Account" at any time to indicate that you no longer want to receive these messages. 
    After you log in, just click on "My Profile". This will send you into the pages where 
    you can review and modify your membership information and profile. From time to time 
    we may e-mail Members important information regarding the Site or the use of the Site. 
    Members may not opt out of receiving this information.</p><p>

    <b></b></p></li><li><b>Can I update or correct my personal information?</b><p>

    Your account information is contained within your Member Profile. You may edit your 
    Profile at any time, all you need is your Member ID and Password. After you log in as 
    a Member, click on "My Profile" from the homepage and you can view, update, and 
    correct your account information. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual 
    information that will remain within our databases, access logs, and other records, 
    which may or may not contain personally identifiable information.</p><p>

    <b></b></p></li><li><b>How does TECHDECK.COM protect my information?</b><p>
    Your TECHDECK.COM Member Profile is password-protected.  In order to maintain this 
    protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, we recommend that, if you share 
    your computer with other people, you sign out of your Member Account and close your 
    browser window when you are done. Signing off will help protect your Member Profile 
    information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a 
    public place like a library. We use reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal 
    information is secure on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the 
    Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the 
    security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. YOU 
    ARE ENTIrelY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR MEMBER NAME AND 
    PASSWORD AND FOR ANY AND ALL ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING PURCHASES) THAT ARE CONDUCTED 
    THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT.</p><p>

    <b></b></p></li><li><b>Former Members.</b><p>

    If you cease to be an active user or Member of the Site, we will continue to treat any 
    personal information you have provided to us in connection with the Site in accordance 
    with this Policy, as amended from time to time.  We reserve the right to contact you 
    via e-mail after you cease to be an active user or Member of the Site to inform you 
    about updates and developments on the Site.</p><p>

    <b></b></p></li><li><b>Linked Sites.</b><p>

    This Site may contain links to websites which enable access to content, products and 
    services provided and controlled by parties other than X-CONCEPTS.  X-CONCEPTS is not 
    responsible for the availability of, the content provided on, or the consequences of 
    use of these third party sites.  You should refer to the policies posted by each such 
    site regarding privacy and other topics of concern to you before you use it.  
    X-CONCEPTS provides links to other websites only as a convenience to its users, and 
    the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by X-CONCEPTS of the linked site 
    or the content, products and services available on it.</p><p>

    <b></b></p></li><li><b>Exclusions.</b><p>

    This Policy does not restrict or prohibit our use or disclosure of publicly available 
    information, even if such information is personal in nature, for example, information 
    available in your local white pages.  We reserve the right to transfer any and all 
    information that we collect from our visitors to a third party in the event that we 
    sell or transfer substantially all of our assets related to the Site to such third 
    party, provided such third party agrees to use such personal information in 
    accordance with the terms of this Policy.</p><p>

    <b></b></p></li><li><b>What about privacy for users under 13?</b><p>

    Our registration process is designed to protect the privacy of anyone under the age 
    of 13 by requiring that they obtain parental permission before becoming a Member.  
    The process is as follows: when a child under the age of 13 signs up to become a 
    Member, one of that child's parents must fill out, sign and submit a Parental Consent 
    form. Once we receive the form, we send the parent a confirmation e-mail along with 
    the child's username and password. We do not knowingly collect any information from 
    children under the age of 13 without notifying a parent and giving the parent the 
    opportunity to deny their child's membership. Parents can also revoke permission to 
    let their children participate on the Site at any time.  This process is designed to 
    comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Guidelines.</p><p>
