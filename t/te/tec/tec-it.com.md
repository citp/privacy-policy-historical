For this reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor on the basis of different characteristics (duration of stay, mouse movements...). The service includes the transmission of the IP address and possibly further data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google.

The reCAPTCHA analyses start with entering the website and run completely in the background, website visitors are not informed separately. Data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting his web offers from abusive automated spying and from SPAM.
