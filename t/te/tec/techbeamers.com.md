The purpose of this privacy policy is to serve the users of this site for safety and better user experience. It’ll guide those who may have concerns regarding their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) getting used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that one can use to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.

### What personal data we collect and why we collect it

#### Comments

We don’t have comments enabled on this site. However, there are old comments which could be visible to the public. We also not have the Gravatar service linked and hence can’t show your profile photo in the context of any of your previous comment.

#### Media

We never upload an image with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Hence, visitors to the website won’t be able to extract any location data from the pictures. Also, we don’t allow anyone apart from the authors to upload images.

#### Contact forms

If you use our contact form for communication, then you leave your email address for us to contact you back. We remove such emails from time to time. However, you may contact us to delete any of your previous conversations permanently.

#### Cookies

Neither we have commenting enabled nor do we allow registration or any personal login. So we don’t create any cookie intended for these purposes.

However, we use third-party advertisements from networks like Google AdSense to support our site. They may introduce cookies to supply relevant ads while you are browsing pages.

We use Google Analytics to measure and track the visits to our website. Google Analytics enables a policy to remove the tracking data on a periodic basis, and we comply with it.
