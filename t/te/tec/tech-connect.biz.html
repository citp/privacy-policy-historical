      <p><font color="#003300">We respect and are committed to protecting your
      privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy
      Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used.
      We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only
      in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following
      policies are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion
      lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by Tech-Connect.
      (The Tech-Connect Network includes all Web sites and certain other
      Internet media properties hyper linked from the Tech-Connect home page.)
      The following discloses our Privacy Policy.</font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#003300">What information are you collecting and how
      are you collecting it?</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Every computer connected to the Internet is given
      a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's
      "Internet Protocol". When a visitor requests a page from any Web
      site within the Tech-Connect Network, our Web servers automatically
      recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and
      IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address
      from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine
      our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the Tech-Connect
      Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. See also <b>Will
      you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?</b> We
      do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our
      Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.</font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#003300">What are cookies?</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to
      your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A
      cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by
      other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to
      identify which areas of Tech-Connect's Network of Web sites you have
      visited or customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be
      readily accessible. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how
      many times you've seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use
      this information to better personalize the content, banners, and
      promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept
      cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your
      browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a
      cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your
      experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some
      features may not work as intended.</font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#003300">How do you use single-pixel gifs?</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Tech-Connect and its advertisers may use
      single-pixel gif images, sometimes referred to as web bugs or web beacons,
      to count Web page accesses and gather some general statistical
      information. Tech-Connect does not gather personal information through the
      use of these images. Our advertisers may use single-pixel gifs that can
      track personal information from cookies that may have been previously
      placed on a user's computer by an advertiser.</font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#003300">What information do you collect when I
      register for something?</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Tech-Connect offers access to some services that
      are free but that require registration. We may use your registration
      contact information to send notification of Tech-Connect products and
      services by e-mail and/or postal mail. We also may share that information
      with our clients. Our clients may send you promotional material that is
      related to the topic of the service for which you registered unless you
      have chosen not to receive it. We may also use your IP address internally
      and share it with third parties. See <b>Will you disclose the information
      that you collect to outside third parties?</b></font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#003300">What other information do you request?</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">We may also request your e-mail address or
      mailing address for the purposes of conducting a survey or to provide
      additional services (for example, subscriptions to e-mail newsletters,
      announcement lists or information about conferences and trade shows).
      Whenever we request the identity of a visitor, we will clearly indicate
      the purpose of the inquiry before the information is requested. We
      maintain a strict "No-Spam" policy that means that we do not
      intend to sell, rent, or otherwise give your e-mail address to a
      third-party, without your consent.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">We may from time to time send e-mail announcing
      new Tech-Connect products and services. Except as stated above,
      Tech-Connect will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed to receive.
      If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may
      receive mailings from other third party companies.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">When you enter a contest or other promotion, we
      may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer
      the contest and notify winners.</font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#003300">What information do you collect when I
      purchase something?</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">If you are purchasing something from an
      Tech-Connect media property, we need to know your name, e-mail address,
      mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to
      process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.
      This information may also be used by us to notify you of related products
      and services. Credit card and e-mail information <u>will not</u> be shared
      or sold to third parties for any purpose without your express permission.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Certain Tech-Connect media properties use a
      shopping cart feature that safeguards this information by using industry
      standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the
      information transferred between you and the server, rendering it
      unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Other
      Tech-Connect media properties do not use SSL and thereby do not offer a
      secure coded way to transfer information.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Wherever Tech-Connect collects personal
      information we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on
      that page.</font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#003300">Will you disclose the information you collect
      to outside third parties?</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Tech-Connect will disclose personal information
      and/or an IP address, when required by law or in the good-faith belief
      that such action is necessary to:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conform to the edicts of the
      law or comply with legal process served on Tech-Connect,</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Protect
      and defend the rights or property of the Tech-Connect Network of sites and
      related properties, or visitors to the Tech-Connect Network of sites and
      related properties,</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify
      persons who may be violating the law, the Tech-Connect legal notice and
      Web site User Agreement, the rights of third parties, or otherwise
      misusing the Tech-Connect Network or its related properties,</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Cooperate
      with the investigations of purported unlawful activities.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Tech-Connect uses reasonable precautions to keep
      the information disclosed to us secure. Tech-Connect reserves the right to
      transfer all such information in connection with the sale of all or part
      of Tech-Connect's capital stock or assets. Furthermore, we are not
      responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third
      parties that receive the information. We are not responsible for such
      third party privacy policies or how they treat information about their
      users<br>
      <i>See</i> below, <b>What else should I know about my privacy when online?</b></font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#003300">What else should I know about my privacy when
      online?</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">The Tech-Connect Network of Web sites contains
      many hyperlinks to other Web sites. The Tech-Connnect Web Sites also
      contain advertisements of third parties. Tech-Connect is not responsible
      for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites or advertisers.
      Tech-Connect does not share any of the individual personal information you
      provide Tech-Connect with the Web sites to which Tech-Connect links,
      except as stated elsewhere within this Privacy Policy, although
      Tech-Connect may share aggregate data with such Web sites (such as how
      many people use our site).</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Please check with those Web sites to determine
      their privacy policy.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily
      disclose personal information online - for example through e-mail,
      discussion lists, or elsewhere - that information can be collected and
      used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is
      accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other
      parties in return.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">Ultimately, you are solely responsible for
      maintaining the secrecy of your personal information. Please be careful
      and responsible whenever you're online.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><font color="#003300">Your
      Consent To This Agreement</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#003300">By using our Web site, you consent to the
      collection and use of information by Tech-Connect as specified above. If
      we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this

      use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</font></p>
