### Exchange of Personal Data

We also share Personal Data with service providers for data processing activities such as data storage and analysis.

We contractually require all third parties, including our subsidiaries, to adequately safeguard your Personal Data and not use it for any other purpose than for which it was collected. We will release your Personal Data if you direct us to do so or, if we are required by law. This can be to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process or to defend our legal rights. We may also need to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or in other limited circumstances permitted by the law (including fraud protection and risk reduction).

We may also share your Personal Data in the event of a sale of all, or a portion of our business, stock, or assets that relate to your Personal Data.

### International Data Transfers

In order to provide adequate protection for the international transfer of Personal Data, besides using data transfer agreements, TE Connectivity complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. TE Connectivity has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, redress and enforcement.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <https://www.privacyshield.gov/>.

TE Connectivity is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. TE Connectivity complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. TE Connectivity shall remain responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if its agent processes Personal Data on our behalf in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless TE Connectivity proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
