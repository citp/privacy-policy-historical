<p class="text">
Here are some steps we have taken to ensure your privacy: 

</p><h2>Information Collection and Use </h2>
<p class="text">
We are committed to protecting your privacy and will take every measure to ensure that all information you provide us is held 
confidential. The information you share with us is used strictly to process your order, service your account, and to improve our 
site's content and functionality. It will not be used for purposes of selling, trading, or leasing to others without your prior 
consent. 

</p><h2>Personal Information </h2>
<p class="text">
The information you provide us including your name, email address, mailing address, bank account information, credit card number, 
and expiration date is used strictly to correctly process and bill your orders, contact you when you encounter any problems, and 
if you have chosen to receive, send you information about our company's new services and special offers. 

</p><h2>Registration </h2>
<p class="text">
 It is not necessary to register in order to purchase products from this website.  It is necessary, however, to register in order to 
 buy or sell products through our marketplace platform.  All users of the marketplace (buyers and sellers) must read carefully and 
 agree to the terms of our <a href="http://www.textbookx.com/service/exchange/member-agreement.php">Membership Agreement</a> 
 in order to activate an marketplace account.  Users may also wish to register their information without participating in the 
 marketplace for faster ordering. To register with us, the user must complete the registration form. For purchasing only 
 non-marketplace items, the user is required during registration to give her or his contact information (such as name and email 
 address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. 
 It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as education status and gender), but encouraged so we can 
 provide a more personalized experience on our site.  For this registration level (purchasing only non-marketplace items), 
 Akademos does not store financial data, such as credit card information. If, however, the user desires to become a buyer or 
 seller on the marketplace, in addition to the foregoing, registration requires personal bank account information (for the purpose 
 of payment dispersal) and credit card information (for the purposes of fraud prevention and facilitating purchases), which are stored 
 in encrypted format. 

</p><h2>Order </h2>
<p class="text">
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) 
and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill 
customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

</p><h2>Cookies</h2> 
<p class="text">
We use cookies in our system for order processing and other tracking capabilities. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's 
hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information 
while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, 
the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, 
they may still use our site. Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no 
access to or control over these cookies.  

</p><h2>Log Files </h2>
<p class="text">
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for 
aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

</p><h2>Sharing</h2> 
<p class="text">
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. 
These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 
</p><p class="text">
In some cases, we make special offers available to our customers that are provided by third parties. If you wish to take advantage 
of such an offer, Akademos will transfer relevant personal information over to the third party.  We will not, however, transfer any 
such information without your express prior consent.
</p><p class="text">
We partner with other partners to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other 
contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally 
identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
</p><p class="text">
Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we 
have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or a legal 
process served on our website.

</p><h2>Links </h2>
<p class="text">
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site 
that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the TextbookX 
website.

</p><h2>Newsletter </h2>
<p class="text">
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Members whom have 
chosen to receive email communications will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. 
Please see our choice and opt-out below.

</p><h2>Security </h2>
<p class="text">
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your 
information is protected both online and off-line. When you place an order with us, you are using our secure e-commerce server and 
secure server software (SSL). This means that all of the information you enter is encrypted before we receive it. 
</p><p class="text">
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an <a href="../emailus.php">e-mail.</a> 

</p><h2>Administrative Type Emails</h2>
<p class="text">
We also send the user administrative type email communications. Members are not able to un-subscribe from administrative type emails, 
which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to 
issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

</p><h2>Correction/Updating Personal Information: </h2>
<p class="text">

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will 
endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by clicking the 
"Your Account" link on any page on the website and making the desired changes, or by visiting our 

<a href="http://www.textbookx.com/service/contact.php" title="Questions? Problems? Get them answered here.">Customer Service Center</a>.

</p><h2>Choice/Opt-out </h2>
<p class="text">
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving our newsletter or promotional materials at the point where we ask for 
the information. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these
 communications by replying with "Unsubscribe" in the subject line of the email or by clicking the "Your Account" link on any page 
 on the website and opting out  of these services.

</p><h2>Affiliate Program</h2>
<p class="text">
We are a <a href="http://www.cj.com/" target="_blank">Commission Junction</a> Merchant and, through this network, we have many affiliates.  We also have an internal affiliate network.  All 
information collected on users who have been referred to our site by a Commission Junction or internal affiliate is treated in the same manner 
as information collected on users who come directly to our site.  The only information that is shared with affiliates is the order 
number and the revenue associated with that order for purposes of compensating said affiliates.  

</p><h2>Notification of Changes </h2>
<p class="text">
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will prominently post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of 
what information we collect, how we use it, and the circumstances, if any, under which we disclose it. If at any point we decide to 
use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by 
way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use 
information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
