# Privacy Policy | TextMarks | SMS and Text Alerts Made Easy | SMS API

TextMarks is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy governs TextMarks's treatment of information about users of its service (the "Service"). By registering for and using the Service, you agree to the terms of this Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any goods or services controlled by third parties, even if those third parties are partners of TextMarks.   
This Privacy Policy is available online at http://www.textmarks.com/front/privacy/. TextMarks reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or change this Privacy Policy at any time with or without prior notice to you. You should visit the URL above to review the current Privacy Policy on a regular basis. The date of the last update will be posted at the top of this Privacy Policy for your convenience. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes your full acceptance of those changes.  


### Information Collection and Use  


TextMarks receives your mobile phone number when you send a text message to us. To create a textmark, our TextMarks service requires that your mobile phone number be associated with a TextMarks account. Our use of this information is limited to providing the TextMarks Service and as described in this Privacy Policy. We will ask for your consent before we use this information for any other purpose.

Simply receiving textmarks on your mobile phone does not require you to register for an account with us. Creating textmarks on our web site and other advanced TextMarks services do.

In the course of using our Site and Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, information on your use of our Site and Services that may be connected with you, and any additional information about you that we obtain from partners or other third parties ("Personal Information"). When you register for the Service, and at certain times during your use of the Service, TextMarks will ask you for Personal Information, including but not limited to, your phone number(s), email address, password, credit card or other billing information and home and business postal addresses.

Personal Information may be used (a) to provide you with products and services you request; (b) to anticipate and resolve problems with our products and services; (c) to improve and update our products and services; (d) to process and respond to inquiries; (e) for other purposes communicated to you at the time you provide or authorize the use of the information. TextMarks does not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with third parties other than as set forth herein. 

If you request a TextMark from your cell phone or subscribe to a TextMark, the manager of that TextMark will be able to see your cell phone number - just like any individual to whom you send a text message directly would. 

### Additional Information Disclosure

TextMarks may also use or disclose information about you, including your Personal Information, under the following circumstances:

\- To enforce our Terms of Service or other legal agreements.  
\- To outsource any of the tasks referenced in this Privacy Policy, such as billing or responding to inquiries.  
\- In response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process.  
\- To establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.  
\- To a company controlled by, or under common control with, TextMarks for any purpose permitted by this Privacy Policy.  
\- When TextMarks believes such use or disclosure is (a) necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or (b) required by law.  
\- In the event of a merger, acquisition, consolidation, divestiture, or bankruptcy of TextMarks. Should this occur, TextMarks will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

TextMarks may use and disclose non-personal, aggregate, or summary information regarding our users without further notice. This type of information will not identify you individually.  


### Cookies and Linking Data  


Cookies: A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers can be set to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a site attempts to place a cookie.

### Updating Your Information

### Security

TextMarks employs reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information against acquisition by unauthorized persons. We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information that you submit for use in publicly available areas of the Site. You should never post personal or identifying information in public areas.
