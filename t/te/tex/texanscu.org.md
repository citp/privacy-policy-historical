Website Privacy Policy

At Texans Credit Union, we put our members first and take pride in offering a variety of financial services. Protecting your privacy, along with your financial assets, is central to our mission.

Whether you are an existing member or are considering membership with us, we understand how important it is for you to know how we collect, retain, and use information about you. We recognize that you have a right to expect your personal financial information to remain private and secure. Texans Credit Union maintains standards to ensure that your information is private and secure at all times.

Texans Credit Union's Website Privacy Policy appears below. It is our commitment to protect your personal information in accordance with this policy.

Use, Collection, and Retention of Member Information  
Texans Credit Union collects, retains, and uses information about members only where reasonably necessary--and allowed by law--to administer our business and to provide products, services, and other opportunities that we believe will benefit our members.

When you visit our website, we may collect and retain the following information: (i) your IP address, (ii) the domain name from which you access the Internet (e.g., aol.com, att.net), (iii) the date and time you access our site, (iv) the type of computer you are using, (v) the type of web browser you are using, and (vi) the Internet address of the website from which you directly linked to our site, if applicable. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site and help us make our site more useful to you.

If you identify yourself by inputting personal information at our website, we will use that information only to respond to your inquiry or request. We will not share any such information to any third party unless required by law.

Collection of Information from Children Under 13  
Texans does not permit children under 13 years of age to submit personal information to us online, and we do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under 13.

Maintenance of Accurate Information  
Texans has established procedures to ensure that the personal information you submit to us is accurate, current, and complete at all times in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. If you should find that your information is incorrect, write to us at the following address:

> > > **Texans Credit Union  
>  PO Box 853912  
>  Richardson, TX 75085-3912**

We will respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner.

Limiting Employee Access to Information  
Texans limits employee access to personally identifiable member information to those employees with a valid business reason for knowing such information. We train our employees on the importance of confidentiality and privacy and require each of our employees to comply with this policy, our procedures, and our standards of conduct.

Protection of Information by way of Established Security Procedures  
All of Texans' operational and data processing systems are in a secure environment that protects your account information from being accessed by third parties. In addition, we maintain appropriate security standards and procedures to prevent unauthorized access of all other Credit Union information. By way of example, our Online Banking Solution uses a cryptographic (digital certificate) key to secure account information sent between our server and your browser. This communication key allows us to encrypt data sent through the Internet. Our server also employs sophisticated firewalls to prevent unauthorized access to Credit Union and member information.

Restrictions on Disclosure of Account Information  
Texans Credit Union does not share member information with nonaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except (i) for the exchange of information with reputable information reporting agencies in order to maximize the accuracy and security of such information, and (ii) in connection with providing certain products or services that we believe may benefit our members. We do not sell our members information to anyone.

We place strict limits on companies to whom we provide personally identifiable data for marketing purposes. Whenever we provide information for this purpose, we carefully review the company and the product or service to ensure that it provides value to our members. In addition, we share only the minimum amount of information necessary for that company to offer its product or service to you.

In addition to the foregoing, Texans will also provide member information to nonaffiliated third parties in the following circumstances: (i) in order to complete a transaction initiated by one of our members, (ii) if a member requests it, (iii) in order to enforce an agreement we have with a member, and (iv) if the information disclosure is required by law.

Maintaining Member Privacy in Business Relationships with Third Parties  
When Texans provides member information to a nonaffiliated third party, we require by way of a written agreement that the third party adhere to privacy principles and standards of conduct consistent with those to which Texans adheres for keeping member information confidential. We also ensure that the third party has adequate policies, procedures, and appropriate measures in place to meet its obligation to safeguard your information.
