 FACTS                   DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
Why?                    Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                        consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you
                        how we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to
                        understand what we do.
What?                   The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you
                        have with us. This information can include:
                         Social Security number, name, address and income
                         Account balances and payment history
                         Credit history and credit score
How?                    All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday
                        business. In the section below, we list the reasons financial companies can share their
                        customers’ personal information; the reasons Texans Credit Union chooses to share;
                        and whether you can limit this sharing.
