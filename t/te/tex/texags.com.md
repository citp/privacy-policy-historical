# TexAgs

TexAgs.com was created to provide a constructive community for sharing information, opinions, and life's experiences and is primarily intended for current students, former students, supporters, and fans of Texas A&M University and its athletic programs.

By accepting the User Agreement and Posting Policy below you agree to be a productive citizen of this community.

##  **USER AGREEMENT**

Considering the real-time nature of this discussion forum, it is impossible for us to review posts or confirm the validity of information posted. Please remember that we at TexAgs.com do not actively monitor the contents of and are not responsible for any messages posted. We do not vouch for or warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any message, and are not responsible for the contents of any message.

We have the ability to remove objectionable messages and we will make every effort to do so, within a reasonable time frame, if we determine that removal is necessary. This is a manual process, however, so please realize that we may not be able to remove or edit particular messages immediately.

Although TexAgs.com does not and cannot review the messages posted and is not responsible for the content of any of these messages, we at TexAgs.com reserve the right to delete any message for any or no reason whatsoever.

TexAgs.com reserves the right to revoke posting privileges of an individual for any or no reason at all. You agree that posting in this forum is a privilege and not a right. You will also agree not to take legal action against TexAgs.Com by your participation in this forum.

You agree that you are over the age of 13.

TexAgs.com also reserves the right to change this notice at any time.

 **POSTING POLICY**

TexAgs.com has been around for 10 years, and has grown from one board to well over thirty in that time. Because of this, each forum has developed into a sub-community with its own social norms and mores. For this reason, before you begin posting in a forum spend some time getting to know the personality of some of the posters and the way that the board reacts to certain subjects and posting styles. While the general do’s and don’ts still apply to each forum, there may be subtle differences in their enforcement within each forum.

 **POSTING ON THE FORUMS**

You agree, through your use of this service, that you will not use this forum to post any material which is knowingly:

  1. False and/or defamatory
  2. Inaccurate
  3. Abusive
  4. Vulgar
  5. Hateful
  6. Harassing
  7. Obscene
  8. Profane
  9. Sexually oriented
  10. Threatening
  11. Invasive of a person's privacy
  12. Thread Hijacking (knowingly redirecting the subject of a thread)
  13. Post padding (posting for the sole purpose of increasing post count)
  14. Trolling (posting to purposefully antagonize other posters)
  15. An attempt to get around the profanity filter
  16. Removal of moderator/staff edits from post
  17. Otherwise in violation of any law



When a post is found to contain any of the above violations that post is subject to removal and the poster is subject to further action (See Moderator Actions).

Revealing personal information about others will not be tolerated. TexAgs has a zero tolerance policy for anyone who posts private or defamatory information on this forum without the consent of the parties involved. This includes, but is not limited to, posters on this forum, athletes/staff/officials of Texas A&M University, business owners etc.

 **MODERATOR ACTIONS**

The forums at TexAgs.com are moderated because we feel that it is necessary to maintain the health of this community. The moderators at TexAgs.com have the ability to do a combination of three things when reacting to a post or other user action on the site. The moderator can:

  * Remove or edit the post.
  * Warn the user that a post or subject has violated the User Agreement and Posting Policy.
  * The poster may have their posting privileges suspended for 1 hour, 3 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, or permanently. The length of the suspension is determined by the severity of the action, and/or the user’s moderation history.



Posters that have been frequently moderated may be subject to longer suspensions per occurrence. Moderation questions are to be directed to moderator@texags.com. Please allow 48 hours for a response.

 **VOTING FUNCTION**

The moderators of TexAgs.com take the voting function seriously. The intent of the voting function is to draw moderator attention to a thread or post for review. If it is determined that the thread or post is in violation of our posting policy moderation action will be taken. However, if it is determined that the thread or post is not in violation of our posting policy the votes will be removed and the thread or post will remain. We encourage all users to take advantage of our voting function. It is our most reliable tool in maintaining the health of this community.

In the event that a post has remained up beyond a reasonable amount of time, emails are to be directed to moderator@texags.com, to inform us of the thread in question. A link to the thread is helpful in expediting the review process.

 **PERSONAL ATTACKS**

TexAgs.com will not tolerate hateful speech, degrading remarks, or personal attacks made about other posters, athletes/coaches/faculty at Texas A&M University, or anyone else.

Due to the size, scope and diversity of this forum, subjects that elicit differing opinions and passionate beliefs will undoubtedly be posted. Please remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Refrain from attacking users in a malicious manner because their opinions and remember to direct your disagreement at a poster’s argument and not at the poster as a person. Many good threads have been derailed in the past because they have devolved from constructive debate into name calling.

Criticisms of coaches or administrators at Texas A&M need to be kept to their official capacities as coach or administrator. Attacking these individuals personally is not an appropriate discourse on this forum. This includes calling for the firing of a coach or administrator. This has been a line that we have held for the last ten years at TexAgs.com, from RC Slocum to Melvin Watkins, in not allowing for posters to call for the firing of a coach. In no way does this mean that we agree with the performance of a coach, or are hedging our alignment with a coaching staff or athletic department.

Remember that our student athletes are first and foremost Aggies. Additionally they work tirelessly through blood, sweat and tears to represent the maroon and white to the best of their ability. They deserve our respect. While on these forums we encourage constructive criticisms of athletic performance, but please refrain from extremisms. For example, there is never an instance when you should say this player is the ‘worst player ever,’ or so and so ‘sucks.’ Keep criticisms of a player to a reasonable evaluation of their performance on the field.

We realize that emotion is a part of sports. Please keep your emotions in check and don’t allow them to overrun rational behavior. Remember that these are 18 to 22 year olds playing a game.

In summary, try to refrain from saying something to someone on the forums that you would not say to them in person.

 **POSTING PICTURES AND HYPERLINKS**

All images need to be work safe.. This means no nudity, partial nudity, or pornographic images will be allowed on the site. All posts of this nature will be removed as soon as possible, and will result in an immediate suspension from the forums. As a rule of thumb images that may be suitable for Maxim Magazine are not suitable for the majority of the TexAgs community and will be seen as inappropriate by the moderators of this forum, and result in a suspension. When posting an image ask yourself this question, “Would I want my mother or boss seeing this image on my computer screen?” And post accordingly.

Images like the ones that you would find on IMDB.com are generally fine to post on the site.

Anything hyperlinked on the TexAgs forum that is directed to a site with inappropriate material will be considered by our moderators as being posted directly onto our forums. If you link to a site that has inappropriate content you can be suspended per our posting policies.

 **PREMIUM CONTENT**

Content published in any of the TexAgs.com premium forums (Aggies Only, Premium, Premium Pub, Varsity or Five Star General) is not to be posted on any other TexAgs forum, or other sites on the internet. Users found to be posting premium content from TexAgs.com may be subject to a suspension.

Premium material being shared on the other forums is not permitted. You have paid for the right to participate in those forums, but that does not mean you’re permitted to share that information with anyone you please.

We also ask that our users refrain from posting premium content on TexAgs.com from other sites as well. Users found to be posting premium content from other sites may be subject to a suspension.

 **USERNAMES**

Each person is entitled to one username per email account. Users found to have numerous 'sock puppets' will face moderator action and possible loss of posting privileges. Usernames found to be inappropriate by TexAgs.com will be suspended, and the account holder will need to contact admin@texags.com for renaming the user account and reinstatement of posting privileges.

Using a 'sockpuppet' to get around a suspension will result in a ban for the sockpuppet account, and a lengthened suspension for the original account.

Accounts may not be shared. If an account is found to be shared among more than one person, an indefinite suspension will be placed on the account until the user contacts staff.

Usernames cannot directly reflect the name of a business or organization that is not a current advertiser without explicit, prior permission from TexAgs.

A username may be changed with good reason and at a reasonable frequency by emailing admin@texags.com. Provide the username you wish to change, the email address on the account, and a brief reason as to why you wish to change the username.

 **ADVERTISEMENTS**

Please note that advertisements (including promotion of other sites on the Internet), chain letters, pyramid schemes, and solicitations will not be tolerated on this forum. This includes forum postings, links, signature lines and private messages. The only posters who are permitted to function in this way have been pre-approved by the Administrators at TexAgs.com as paying advertisers.

If a service is requested by a poster on the forums it is permissible to give contact information in response to that specific request.

If you are interested in advertising on TexAgs.com please contact Logan by email, logan@texags.com.

California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:  


Users can visit our site anonymously.

Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.  


Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be easily be found on the page specified above.

You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes: On our Privacy Policy Page

COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

Fair Information Practices

The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify you via email within 7 business days

We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

 **CAN SPAM Act**

The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
