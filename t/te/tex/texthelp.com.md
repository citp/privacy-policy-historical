###### No Texthelp sites are excluded from this policy.

###### **Environment Variables**

We may record your environment variables, such as your IP address, host name, browser type, operating system, etc., to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. This information may be used to help identify you and your shopping cart, track referrals, prevent or report incidents of credit card fraud, or for other purposes deemed reasonable and necessary.

**Cookies**

Our sites may use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart, to personalize our web sites to suit your tastes, to track referral information, and for other purposes.

**Registration and Order Forms**

Site registration and/or order forms may require users to give us contact information (like their name and email address), unique identifiers, and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and to fulfill delivery of ordered products and services. The customer contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to check the user's qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers are collected to verify the user identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.

Potentially sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers) is collected through secure server connections.

Non sensitive information may be e-mailed to Texthelp representatives or agents. This e-mail is generally not encrypted. As such, there is a remote possibility that the information could be intercepted by third parties. Visitors always have the option to provide this information in an alternative format.

**Third Party Access to Information**

Only such information as is necessary in order to process payments, and to fulfill product and service delivery requirements will be provided to third-parties. Texthelp Limited will comply with any subpoena or summons issued by any federal, state, or local law enforcement or judicial agencies for information. We may voluntarily provide unsolicited information to appropriate authorities if we believe the information is relevant to a criminal investigation. Unless clearly and specifically stated at the point the information is gathered, we will not sell, give away, or otherwise share information about you for any purpose other than the purposes mentioned in this document.

Our web sites may contain links to other, non-Texthelp sites. Texthelp Limited is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

Our sites may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

Our sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These measures include the use of secure servers to collect the information, encrypted databases, storage of the information in non-public areas of the servers, and other measures as deemed reasonable and necessary.
