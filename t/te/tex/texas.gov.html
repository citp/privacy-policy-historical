		<h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
			<p>The Department of Information Resources is committed to providing an accessible web presence that enables the public full access to Texas government information and services. The Department of Information Resources has identified disability as a barrier to Internet access. This policy addresses accessibility from a disability standpoint. The following barriers to Internet access may be addressed in forthcoming versions of this policy: geographic barriers, economic barriers, and language barriers. Understanding that government has a responsibility to provide service to all citizens and businesses in its jurisdiction, the Department of Information Resources will make reasonable efforts to accommodate all users.</p>
			
			<p>In order to make the TexasOnline website accessible, the Department of Information Resources has chosen to comply with high accessibility standards in order to make the TexasOnline web site accessible to all who visit. This policy describes these accessibility standards and may be updated periodically. The current version was approved on July 9, 2004.</p>
		
			<div align="right">[<a href="#contentstart">back to top</a>]</div>
			
		<h3>Origin</h3>
			<p>The TexasOnline Electronic Framework Project and the TexasOnline Division of the Department of Information Resources were established pursuant to Subchapter I of Chapter 2054, Texas Government Code and the authority of the Department of Information Resources. This document is rendered under the sanction of the Department of Information Resources.</p>

		<h3>TexasOnline Accessibility Policy / Disability Barriers</h3>
		
			<p>Some form of disability affects as much as twenty-three percent of the Texas population.  These include but are not limited to hearing impairment, visual impairment and cognitive disorders.</p>
		
			<p>The Department of Information Resources is committed to making TexasOnline accessible to all users. Reasonable efforts will be made to accommodate all users who utilize standards compliant web browsers as well as enabling software or assistive devices. We welcome comments on how to improve the site's accessibility for users with disabilities.</p>
			
			<h4>Standard for Compliance</h4>
		
				<p><a href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=3">Section 508</a> of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, sets forth guidelines for developing and maintaining accessible information technology. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that would help achieve these goals. The law applies to all federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Though not specifically bound by this federal legislation, the Department of Information Resources has chosen to use Section 508 as the standard for accessibility compliance for TexasOnline.
			</p>
				
				<p>To verify compliance with Section 508, TexasOnline is regularly tested using Bobby, the leading web site accessibility technology originally created by CAST (Center for Applied Special Technology, an educational, not-for-profit organization) and now maintained by Watchfire software. This testing demonstrates that TexasOnline is compliant with Section 508.  In addition, volunteers from various organizations have reviewed the web site.  The results of these reviews have been incorporated into the web site to improve its accessibility on a more practical level.</p>
			
			<h4>Additional Information</h4>
			
			<p>Additional information about accessibility programs in Texas is available from the <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/disabilities/">Governor's Committee on People with Disabilities</a>.  The Committee serves as a central source of information on the abilities, rights, problems, and needs of the estimated 4 million Texans with disabilities.  The Committee's web site has additional information about the history of Texans with disabilities, statistical material and resources to provide a clearer picture about the number of people with disabilities and accessibility programs in Texas.</p>
		
			<h4>Contact Information</h4>
			
				<p>If you use assistive technology and the format of any material on our web site interferes with your ability to access the information, please email <a href="mailto:webmaster@www.state.tx.us">webmaster@www.state.tx.us</a>.  To enable us to respond in a manner most helpful to you, please indicate the nature of your accessibility problem, the preferred format in which to receive the material, the web address of the requested material, and your contact information.</p>

		<h3>Collection of Information</h3>

			</p><ul>
				<li>To conduct online transactions with the appropriate state agency or local government (such as the payment of sales tax or the renewal of a license or permit);</li>
				<li>To send an email to the individual using the online service confirming the transaction; or</li>
				<li>To provide information about new features offered by TexasOnline, to visitors who have elected to opt-in to receive the service.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>

Information about the <a href="http://www.oag.state.tx.us/AG_Publications/txts/2004publicinfohb_3_01.shtml">Texas Public Information Act</a> is available from the Office of the Attorney General and at <a href="http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/GV/content/htm/gv.005.00.000552.00.htm">Texas Government Code, Chapter 552</a>. Additionally, although TexasOnline does not sell or release personally identifiable information, certain state agencies or local governments whose sites are accessible through TexasOnline may have different policies concerning the sale or release of personally identifiable information. Information about those policies should be obtained from the appropriate state agency or local government.</p>
			<div align="right">[<a href="#contentstart">back to top</a>]</div>
		
		<h3>Access to Information</h3>
			<p>Unless a governmental body is authorized to withhold the information from an individual under Texas Government Code, Section 552.023, individuals are entitled to receive the information that state agencies and local governments collected through TexasOnline.

			<div align="right">[<a href="#contentstart">back to top</a>]</div>
			
	<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
		<p>TexasOnline uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure transmissions. SSL applies encryption between two computers, in this case the individual’s personal computer and the TexasOnline server.

As a minimum, the following information will be protected when transmitted to TexasOnline:
		</p><ul>
			<li>Name;</li>
			<li>Social Security Number;</li>
			<li>All credit, debit, and charge card numbers;</li>
			<li>Bank account and electronic check information;</li>
			<li>Transaction payment information;</li>
			<li>Personal identification numbers (PIN) and passwords; and</li>
			<li>Email addresses.</li>
		</ul>
		A web browser will automatically activate the appropriate security features when initiating a transaction on TexasOnline. On most browsers, an unbroken key or locked padlock graphic at the bottom of the browser screen indicates that a secure connection is established.<p></p>
		<div align="right">[<a href="#contentstart">back to top</a>]</div>
		
		<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>Some of the online transactions hosted on TexasOnline use cookies. A cookie is a small text file that a website stores on a visitor’s personal computer to track specific information about that visitor’s interaction with the website.

Persistent cookies continue to exist after a few minutes of inactivity, after the browser is closed or after a visitor completes a single session. TexasOnline uses persistent cookies to track visitor activity on the site to structure content and make the TexasOnline websites easy to use. All persistent cookies from TexasOnline will expire within twenty-five months.</p>
			
			<p><strong>TexasOnline cookies do not contain or collect personal identifiable information about visitors. Moreover, TexasOnline will not match visitor activities with personally identifiable information.</strong></p>
			
			<p>If an individual’s web browser does not accept cookies, he or she may not be able to conduct online transactions on TexasOnline. However, this will not hinder normal browsing of the website.</p>
			
			<p>TexasOnline does not utilize web bugs or any other technology to track user activity other than those stated in this policy.</p>
