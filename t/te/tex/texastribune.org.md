# Privacy Policy | The Texas Tribune

_Last updated June 10, 2015_

### INTRODUCTION 

This Privacy Policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) explains how Texas Tribune, Inc. (“ **The Texas Tribune** ,” “ **we,** ” and “ **us** ”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information. 

This Privacy Policy applies when The Texas Tribune collects data from guests (“ **you** ”) through the websites, mobile applications, software, and services controlled, whether partially or otherwise, by The Texas Tribune (the “ **Services** ”). If a service is co-branded or developed by a third party, the third party’s privacy statement may also apply. 

We have included several annotations in boxes to help explain the legal jargon and emphasize key sections. These annotations are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. 

“ **Personal Information** ” includes information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you (e.g., name, address, telephone number, email address, and location). We do not consider “Personal Information” to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual. By disclosing your Personal Information to us or using the Services, you consent to our collection and use of it consistent with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy (which is expressly incorporated into any Service’s terms of use). 

### HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION 

We collect Personal Information when you: 

  * register to use the Services;
  * log in with social networking credentials;
  * use the Services; and
  * communicate with us.



We also collect information, such as anonymous usage statistics, by using cookies, server logs, and other similar technology as you use the Services. When we link Personal Information with other information, we treat all of the linked information as Personal Information. 

**Personal Information Collection**. 

In general, you can visit the Services without identifying yourself or revealing any of your Personal Information. In a few areas on the Services, we ask you to provide Personal Information, such as your email address, first and last name, and address that will enable us to enhance your use of the Services or for purposes such as facilitating correspondence with you, registering your entitlement to access certain special features of the Services, in connection with your participation in promotions or special programs, or to complete transactions, including donations. It is always your choice whether or not to provide that Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use certain features of the Services. 

**Using the Services.** We collect information you post through the Services. For example, when you interact with other users by commenting on stories or submitting a contribution, we will collect the information you provide in such submissions, including any Personal Information. 

**Making Payments**. When you make payments through the Services, such as in connection with making a donation, you may need to provide Personal Information, such as your credit card number and billing address. That information will be provided directly to our third party payment processor, and The Texas Tribune will not have access to and will not store or maintain your credit card information on our servers. 

**Customer Support**. We may collect Personal Information through your communications with our customer-support team. 

**Location Data**. The Services may collect location data to provide location-related functionality (“ **Location Data** ”). For example, we may collect and store your location information if you enable your mobile device to send it to us. We may link Location Data to other information we have collected about you. 

**Social Sign-On.** You may be given the option to access or register for some features of the Services through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an “ **Integrated Service** ”), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials through Facebook Connect, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide Personal Information or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to the Services. 

**Contests, Giveaways, and Promotions**. From time to time, The Texas Tribune may offer you the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways, and other promotions, which you may decline to participate in. Any information submitted in connection with such activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, except as specifically set forth in the rules for the applicable contest, giveaway, or promotion. 

**Outside Sources.** We may obtain information, including Personal Information, about you from third parties and sources other than the Services, such as our partners, advertisers, and Integrated Services. For example, we may obtain commercially available demographic information from third parties or collect device ID information from your device as you use the Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

**Automatic Data Collection.** We and our vendors and suppliers may collect your usage activity, preferences, and browser details (such as your IP address and browser type) during your use of the Services. 

**Cookies and Related Technologies.** Cookies are small lines of text/data that are written onto your computer by a website. The Texas Tribune and others acting on our behalf may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar technologies to operate the Services. These technologies may collect and store Personal Information as well as usage statistics and other non-personal information. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. If you do that, however, the Services may not work properly. 

By using the Services, you are authorizing us to gather, parse, and retain data related to the provision of the Services.
