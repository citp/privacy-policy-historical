# Privacy Policy | Team Rubicon

#### 1\. Introduction

Team Rubicon, Inc. (‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’, or ‘company’) is committed to respecting your personal privacy and recognizes that you may be concerned about the information you provide to us and how we treat that information.

This “Privacy Statement” has been established to inform you of our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing information that we obtain from you in connection with your use of the our websites (each, a “ _Website_ ”), mobile applications, or other services and applications that link to this Privacy Statement (each and collectively, and including the Websites, the “ _Service_ ” or “ _Services_ ”). By accessing a Service, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree to this Privacy Statement, please do not access the Service. This Privacy Statement is incorporated into, and part of, the _Terms and Conditions_ , which govern your use of the Services in general.

#### 2\. What is Personally Identifiable Information?

Personally identifiable information (“ _PII_ ”) is information about an identifiable individual, which may include, name, address, email address, payment card information, birth date, employment history, veteran status, certain health related data, passport information and photographs. PII does not include aggregated information that does not allow you to be identified.

#### 3\. Collecting Personal Information

You can decide what PII you provide us. We will collect PII that you choose to provide, via the Services. You may choose to provide us with PII if, for example, you: contact us with an inquiry; register with a Service; make a donation or purchase; fill out a survey or other form with your PII included; request us to provide you with information; request us to contact you; post information to public areas of the Services; or take advantage of a promotion.

We may also collect information about you from other third parties, including demographic information, and combine this information with other information we collect about you.

#### 4\. Use of Cookies

In common with many websites, we or third parties use ‘cookies’ and other similar technologies to help us gather information from visitors to our Services, as further described below. A ‘cookie’ is a small data file that can be placed on the hard drive of your computer. The use of cookies helps us to assist your use of certain aspects of the Services. You can delete cookies at any time, or you can set your browser to reject or disable cookies. If you do disable cookies some functions on the Services may not function correctly or optimally. We may use information from cookies or other similar technologies for the following purposes:

  * Traffic monitoring, for example: the IP address from which you access a Service, the type of browser and operating system used to access a Service, the date and time of your access to a Service, the pages you visit, the referencing URL, and the recognition of repeat visitors for statistical/analytical purposes.
  * Anonymous tracking of interaction with online advertising, for example, to monitor the number of times that a banner ad is displayed and the number of times it is clicked.
  * Compiling and reporting to third parties (such as advertisers) aggregate statistics about our users in terms of numbers, traffic patterns, and related Service information.



We may connect the information that we collect through cookies and other technologies with PII that you provide to us for purposes, including:

  * To customize or personalize your experience of a Service, for example, so that we can greet you on the Service by name.
  * For transactional purposes, such as payment card purchases.
  * To monitor your use of our Services in order to make our communications to you as relevant as possible, for example, sending you email communications relevant to the parts of a Service that you visit most often or by letting you know about features of the Service that you have not accessed previously.



#### 5\. Do Not Track Disclosures

We may use tracking technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). We will comply with web browser “do not track” signals that you may set in your web browser regarding the collection of PII about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.

#### 6\. Use of Information

Team Rubicon is dedicated to ensuring the privacy and security of our donors. We use donor contact information (name, address, phone number, credit card information, email address) only to process donations and inform donors of Team Rubicon’s progress towards our stated mission. Team Rubicon does not sell, trade, or share any private donor contact information obtained in any way with other organizations. When donations are made through a third-party organization, donor information is only utilized to process the donation. Team Rubicon operates through a secure site when charging credit cards for donations.

At any time, Team Rubicon donors may opt out of mailing lists the organization uses to contact them. Team Rubicon donors have the right to be informed of how the organization uses their donations, including having access to Team Rubicon’s recent audited financial statements. Team Rubicon also publicly lists their board of directors, who exercise prudent judgment in their governing responsibilities. Team Rubicon donors may ask questions when making a donation and receive truthful and prompt answers. Team Rubicon handles all donations with respect and confidentiality.

If donors have questions regarding their donations they can call (310) 640-8787.

**_Marketing Analysis_**. We may use your information for marketing analysis, for example, to assess trends amongst our consumers or to measure the amount of traffic to a Service.
