 **Processing of Personal Information contained in User Content:** The Supplier does not own, control or direct the use of any of the information stored or processed by You via the Services. Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such information. The Supplier is largely unaware of what information is actually being stored or made available by You to the Platform and the Services and does not directly access such information or data except as authorised by the Client or as necessary to provide Services to the Client.

Because the Supplier does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Information contained in the User Content and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Information is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Information or the uses of such information, the Supplier is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union’s Directive 95/46/EC on data privacy (hereinafter referred to as the “Directive”) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the Directive. The Supplier should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any User Content containing Personal Information that is subject to the requirements of the Directive. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, the Supplier does not independently cause User Content containing Personal Information stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of the Supplier in connection with Supplier’s provision of Services to its Clients. Such actions are performed or authorised only by the applicable Client or User.

The Client or the User is the data controller under the Directive for any User Content containing Personal Information, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Information is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Information. The Supplier is not responsible for the content of the Personal Information contained in the User Content or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is the Supplier responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.

 **How We use the information We collect:** Our primary purpose for collecting Personal Information is to provide You with safe, smooth, efficient and customized Services on the Platform. You agree that We may use Your Personal Information in a variety of ways in providing the Services and operating our business, including the following:

i) to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Web Site, the Platform and the Services, to provide support and information that You request, to respond to comments and questions, otherwise support You if requested;

ii) to understand and analyse the usage trends and preferences, to meet the needs of our Clients and Users, to improve the Platform and the Services, to develop new products, services, features, tools and functionalities;
