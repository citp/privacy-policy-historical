# Teaching Strategies, Inc. - Security and Privacy Policies

Inside this page: Security Policy | Privacy Policy

**Our Security Policy**

Your **credit card** and personal **contact information**  are safe when you buy from the Teaching Strategies Web site.

The Teaching Strategies online bookshop runs on a secure server, which means that orders placed with most Web browsers will be encrypted. This information is garbled as it is sent through the Internet, preventing it from being intercepted and read by unauthorized personnel. We also have instant credit authorization so that your credit card is charged instantly and the number is discarded the second the process is complete. We never store your credit card information. In fact, no human eyes ever see your credit card number. 

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which is an industry-standard security protocol encryption technology and an encryption feature included in most modern Internet browsers. SSL encrypts your credit card number as it travels over the Internet. Information encrypted with SSL is nearly impossible for unauthorized parties to decode. All major Internet stores use this technology and it has been approved by the major credit card companies. This makes doing business over the Internet as secure as purchasing by telephone or making a purchase in a store. Your credit card number is deleted as soon as it is handled by our instant authorization process, so it is safe from those who should not have access to it.

Whenever your credit card information is requested or displayed, you'll notice that our Internet URL address begins with "https." The "s" in the address means that our secure server has queried your computer's Web browser software to encrypt all information before transmitting it. This encryption is performed using SSL. Since Teaching Strategies has a valid certificate, you can have confidence that you are sending information to the right place and know you are doing business at a secure site because you will see an unbroken  icon in your status bar. When your browser is in "secure" mode it encrypts all the information between itself and the server. Encrypted information is meaningless to eavesdroppers, so your personal information is secure.

**Our Privacy Policy**  
  
Your information is safe with Teaching Strategies. We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust. We  **never**  sell your information or share it with others.

**What Personal Information About Customers Does Teaching Strategies  Gather?**

  * **Account Information** : We receive and store the contact information you give us if you set up an account (sometimes referred to as "become a member" or "join our community."). For your protection, we do not store credit card numbers. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing training for you, improving our services, and communicating with you about our products and services. 


  * **Order or Registration Information:** In the process of making a purchase through our bookshop or registering for a conference online, you will be asked to provide contact and billing information. If you opt not to create an account with Teaching Strategies, this information will only be used to process your order or registration. 


  * **Automatic Information** : We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the Teaching Strategies Web site. We do not use it to send "pop-up" advertising, and we do not sell the information to other companies. 

Examples of the information we collect include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; and cookie number.



  * **E-Mail Communications** : If you place an order with us, we will use your e-mail address to communicate with you regarding your order and to send you, from time to time, e-mails about Teaching Strategies' products, services, and events. We will not send you our e-mail newsletter or postings from our e-mail discussion list **unless** you subscribe to these services. When you subscribe to these lists, you are giving us permission to communicate with you. If you sign up for the e-mail discussion list, you are also providing permission for others in the discussion group to send you e-mails. 



> It's easy to unsubscribe from our newsletter and e-mail list, and each e-mail you get from either our newsletter or e-mail list will contain information about how to unsubscribe. If you ever have trouble unsubscribing, please complete our online [Customer Solutions Inquiry Form](http://www.teachingstrategies.com/bookshop/CustomerInquiry.cfm) and a Customer Solutions Specialist will remove your name from the list.

**What About Cookies?**

  * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser. They enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features like saving your shopping cart and retaining your conference waiting lists.


  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our most important features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.   




**Does Teaching Strategies Share the Information It Receives?**

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we  **never**  sell your information or share it with others. 

**How Secure Is Information About Me?**

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input during the checkout process. 
  * We employ instant credit card verification. Once your credit card number is verified, it is deleted, with the exception of the last five digits, which are encrypted by SSL.
  * We retain only the last five digits of your credit card numbers for identification purposes in case you later want a refund. 
  * It is important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password or to your computer. Be sure to LOG OFF when you are finished using the Teaching Strategies Web site, especially if you are using a shared computer. Store your password in a secure location and never share it with others. This is particularly important if your company uses the "bill later" credit account feature, which authorizes us to invoice your company when an order is placed.



**Where Can I View, Modify or Update  My Contact Information?**

> Each time you log on to the Teaching Strategies Web site, you will see your customer profile. We suggest that you review your cusotmer profile and keep it current at all times.

**What Choices Do I Have?**

  * You may visit our site and take advantage of the free content without providing any information at all. 
  * When you make a purchase, you can bypass the account setup process. This means that the contact information we need to bill, ship, and process your order will be stored only for the purpose of filling your order. This information cannot be retrieved on the Teaching Strategies Web site. The next time you make a purchase, you will have to reenter this data. 
  * The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to take advantage of many important features on the Teaching Strategies site if you do not use cookies. 



**Still Concerned?**

If you have any concerns about privacy on the Teaching Strategies Web site, please complete our online [Customer Solutions Inquiry Form](http://www.teachingstrategies.com/bookshop/CustomerInquiry.cfm). A Customer Solutions Specialist will address your concerns.
