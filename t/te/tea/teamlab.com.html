            Privacy Statement
        </div>
        <p>
            Since your privacy is important to us, Ascensio System SIA has created this statement
            in order to let you know our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses
            our information gathering and dissemination practices for the Ascensio System SIA
            website <a href="http://www.teamlab.com">http://www.teamlab.com</a>. By using our website you explicitly consent to such
            use of your information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <div class="title">
            Information Collection
        </div>
        <p>Ascensio System SIA collects information that personally identifies you ("Personal
            Information") in case you choose to register with TeamLab service. We require your
            first and last names, as well as your e-mail address in order to authenticate users
            and provide access to TeamLab accounts.</p>
        <p>
            If you choose not to register or provide Personal Information, you can still use
            our website anonymously. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration.
            Only the domain name from which you access the Internet, the Internet address and
            the date and time you access our website are logged. Ascensio System SIA uses this
            information to analyse trends and to measure the number of visitors of our website.</p>
        <p>
            We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer
            our website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your time spent
            at our website, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see
            which parts of our website users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything
            personally identifiable. This means, for instance, that a user's session will be
            tracked, but the user will remain anonymous. We do not use this information for
            any other purposes.</p>
        <div class="title">
            Use of Personal Information
        </div>
        <p>When a user submits Personal Information, it is kept on a private server not accessible
            from the Internet. This limits the possibility of any malicious use of your Personal
            Information.</p>
        <p>
            Ascensio System SIA may share non-personal, summary information regarding TeamLab
            users with partners or other third parties. However, we will not share any individual
            customer information outside of the contracted partners and third parties without
            first receiving the individual's prior written approval. In short, Ascensio System
            SIA does not sell registrant information to lists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ascensio System SIA may send you tips on using TeamLab, notify you of and get your
            feedback on upcoming releases or new services offered. The users are able to unsubscribe

        <p>
            During your visit to our website, so-called "cookies" are saved to your computer.
            These "cookies" register information about navigation of your computer on our website
