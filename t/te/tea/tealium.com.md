For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, Personal Data is information, including Sensitive Data, that is: (i) about an identified or identifiable individual, (ii) received by us in the U.S. from the EU or Switzerland, and (iii) recorded in any form. Personal Data does not include anonymous or non-personal information (i.e., information that cannot be associated with or tracked back to a specific individual). “Sensitive Data” means Personal Data specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, sex life, the commission or alleged commission of any offense, any proceedings for any offense committed or alleged to have been committed by the individual or the disposal of such proceedings, or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.

**2.1.2   What Personal Data Do We Collect?**

We may collect and maintain Personal Data regarding Site Visitors and Customers and potentially their customers. In addition to Personal Data such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, we may also collect information from your web browser (such as browser type and browser language), and the actions you take on our website and our Customer’s websites (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked).

**2.1.3    For What Purposes Do We Collect Personal Data?**

The Personal Data we collect is used and disclosed, as reasonably required for our business purposes, including complying with our legal obligations and for marketing and product functionality purposes. For example:

●      We use cookies to make your interactions with the Tealium website easy and helpful. When you visit our website, our servers send a cookie to your device. Cookies that are used as part of the services (in the proxy) may include cookies of a third party website that is being co-browsed, for example, in order to deliver the website as intended by the third party website operator. Our services may also use tracking pixels embedded by our Customers in their online advertising, often distributed to third party websites using ad exchanges, that allow Customers to gather data about viewers of their online advertising. For more information on how Tealium uses cookies, please [see here](https://web.archive.org/cookie-policy/).

Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about website usage, e-mail response and tracking.

●    We collect information about our Site Visitors’ utilization and navigation of our website. This information helps us to design our website to better suit our Site Visitors’ needs. We may also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, analyze trends, track Site Visitor movements, and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying Site Visitor preferences.

●    We use aggregated data as a statistical measure and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Aggregated data enables us to determine how often certain parts of our website or the Services are used so that we can improve them. We may make use of, or make such aggregated data available to, third parties, in any manner in our sole discretion. Tealium may engage third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from Site Visitors.

You may be given the option by such Social Media to post information about your activities on our website to your profile page on the Social Media network in order to share with others within your network.

●    We may contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from our website, from emails, and on third-party websites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other websites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We may also partner with third parties to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity.

●    Our services provide Customers a platform that may collect data, including Personal Data, from their customers and to use that information to create real-time profiles of such customers that integrate with their digital marketing platforms. We do not control our Customers’ use of the Personal Data, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies.

●    Our platform may analyze the information collected from a website, ours or our Customers’, in order to create segments of customers and to combine these segments into audiences in order to enrich the capabilities of the website and to correlate data across various customer-consumer touch points such that our Customers gain a unified view of their customers profiles.

●       It may be necessary for us to disclose your Personal Data, either by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

Relevant information also may be found in notices pertaining to specific data processing activities.

**2.2**      **Choice**

We offer Site Visitors and Customers who provide contact information the means to choose how we use the information provided.

Tealium honors Do Not Track (DNT) headers and allows its users to opt‐out of having their personal information collected by Tealium. We also provide guidelines and instructions on how to honor DNT headers. The behavior of utag.js can be altered to track only analytic data and not track individual visitors. Tealium’s website honors DNT and is compliant with California Assembly Bill 370.

Individuals have a right to choose whether their Personal Data may be disclosed to third-party controllers or used for a purpose that is materially different from the purposes for which the information was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent required by the Privacy Shield Principles, Tealium obtains opt-in consent for certain uses and disclosures of Sensitive Data. You have a right to withdraw such consent at any time. If we decide to use Personal Data for a purpose other than those that are materially the same as those indicated in this Privacy Statement, individuals shall be offered the opportunity to opt-in to the use. We shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate individual privacy preferences.

**Exceptions.** We may disclose your Personal Data without offering an opportunity to opt out, when (i) we retain third-party processors to perform services on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions, (ii) required by law or legal process, or (iii) responding to lawful requests from public authorities, including to meet national security, public interest or law enforcement requirements. We may also transfer Personal Data in the event of an audit or if we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, dissolution, or liquidation).

**2.3**      **Accountability for Onward Transfer**

We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

**2.4**      **Security**

We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the nature of the Personal Data. Tealium has a SOC2 Type 2 audit performed regularly to independently assess and attest to the effectiveness of Tealium’s information security policies and practices.

**2.5**      **Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation**

We limit the Personal Data we process to that which is relevant for the purposes of the particular processing. We do not process your Personal Data in ways that are inconsistent with the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by you. In addition, to the extent necessary for these purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data we process is (i) reliable for its intended use, and (ii) accurate, complete and current. In this regard, we rely on you to update and correct Personal Data to the extent necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may contact us as indicated in the Subject Access procedure in section 2.10 below to request that we update or correct relevant Personal Data.

Subject to applicable law, we retain Personal Data in a form that identifies or renders you identifiable only for as long as it serves a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected or subsequently authorized by you.

You generally have the right to access your Personal Data. Accordingly, where appropriate, we provide you with reasonable access to the Personal Data we maintain about you. We also provide you a reasonable opportunity to choose whether to receive offers and promotions from us and correct, amend, or delete your information.

We may limit or deny access to Personal Data where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. Other reasons for denying or limiting access include (i) interference with the execution or enforcement of the law or with private causes of action, including the prevention, investigation or detection of offenses or the right to a fair trial; (ii) disclosure where the legitimate rights or important interests of others would be violated; (iii) breaching a legal or other professional privilege or obligation; (iv) prejudicing employee security investigations or grievance proceedings or in connection with employee succession planning and corporate re-organizations; or (v) prejudicing the confidentiality necessary in monitoring, inspection or regulatory functions connected with sound management, or in future or ongoing negotiations involving the organization.
