					  <p>The genesis for TeamUnify started when Tom Fristoe became President of Tri Valley Masters Swim Team, as well, his association with Pleasanton Seahawks Swim Team, where his three daughters swam. Tom witnessed the repetitive tasks and issues that these volunteer run teams face everyday and how each struggled to effectively manage themselves. The core issue is that data and process was not centralized. In-turn the part-time administrators struggled to be effective. Everyone was working on separate tasks from separate islands of data. The scenario begged to be fixed by moving the tasks and information into one central location.
                      <br><br>Tom and long-time friend Ming Lee started the long development process of engineering and then re-engineering the platform as they learned what worked best to enable the greatest productivity with the least amount of work. In the summer of 2007 TeamUnify moved from the "helping stage" and incorporated. The name TeamUnify was chosen because is represents our mission to unify a team together. In the process, we re-located to Bend, Oregon and opened our offices.
                      <br><br>The full-time effort quickly delivered results. We raced from a handful of teams to 1,000+ and are now growing at nearly 40 new teams every month. Add to this, the revolutionary family of mobile products called OnDeck, TeamUnify continues to establish new standards for how swim teams, coaches and lessons programs will manage themselves more effectively with less effort. The result is a software platform, designed specifically for swimming, that delivers centralized business process optimization that's really easy-to-use. The platform is time tested, with intelligent automation, SwimOffice will help a swim team perform far better than today. See a Demo today.</p>

This is why it's a top priority. We devote significant resources to continually develop our world-class security infrastructure.

                      <br><br><strong>Physical Security</strong>
                      <br>Our production equipment is collocated at a facility that provides 24-hour physical security, redundant electrical generators and other backup equipment designed to keep servers continually up and running.
                      <br><br><strong>Data Encryption</strong>
                      <br>TeamUnify leverages the strongest encryption products to protect customer data and communications, including 128-bit Thawte SSL Certification. The lock icon in the browser indicates that data is fully shielded from access while in transit.
                      <br><br><strong>User Authentication</strong>
                      <br>Users access TeamUnify only with a valid user name and password combination, which is encrypted via SSL while in transmission. Users are prevented from choosing weak or obvious passwords
                      <br><br><strong>Operating System Security</strong>
                      <br>TeamUnify enforces tight operating system-level security by using a minimal number of access points to all production servers. We protect all operating system accounts with strong passwords, and production servers do not share a master password database. All operating systems are maintained at each vendor's recommended patch levels for security and are hardened by disabling and/or removing any unnecessary users, protocols, and processes.
                      <br><br><strong>Database Security</strong>
                      <br>Whenever possible, database access is controlled at the operating system and database connection level for additional security. Access to production databases is limited to a number of points, and production databases do not share a master password database.
                      <br><br><strong>Server Management Security</strong>
                      <br>All data entered into the TeamUnify application by a customer is owned by that customer. TeamUnify employees do not have direct access to the TeamUnify production equipment, except where necessary for system management, maintenance, monitoring and backups. The TeamUnify Engineering team provides all system management, maintenance, monitoring, and backups.
