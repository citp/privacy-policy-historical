**Links**  
This policy applies only to site(s) maintained by TeamWarfare. We may create links to the websites of our promotional partners and companies for games that are supported through our competitions. Although we will make every effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining each individual's right to privacy, this policy does not apply to third party sites. 

Additionally, many other sites that we are not associated with and have not authorized may have links leading to our site. We cannot control these links and are not responsible for any content appearing on these sites. Furthermore, we do not support links to third party sites in our forums, and we are not responsible for any content appearing on those sites.
