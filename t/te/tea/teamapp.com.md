# Team App Privacy Policy

This policy details the kind of personal information that we collect in our business, including through the Website and/or the App (and or Club Apps as defined below), and the ways in which we use it.

In this privacy policy, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” refers to Team Mates Pty Ltd ACN 159 770 537. The term “Website” means the website located at www.teamapp.com and the term “App” means our application for Android, iOS and any other operating systems referred to on our Website.

### Australian Privacy Principles

In Australia, the Australian Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act (1988) (Cth govern the handling of personal information. In this privacy policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and includes information about an identifiable individual, including their name, gender, date of birth, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, drivers’ licence details, credit information and history, banking details, photographs, employment details and if and where applicable, information that constitutes “sensitive information”. “Personal information” includes an opinion about an identifiable individual.

“Sensitive information” is a subset of personal information and includes information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, health information, political opinions, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association or trade union, sexual preferences or practices and criminal record.

### 1\. Collection of personal information

We collect some personal information about individuals. We collect personal information from individuals in circumstances such as the following:

  * When we meet or deal with an individual from an organisation wishing to do business with us;


  * When a person signs up to become a user of the App and/or when a person becomes an administrator (“Club App Administrator”) of a team or a club’s tailored app created using the App (collectively “Club App”);


  * When a user posts content that includes personal information through the App or a Club App;


  * When a user visits the Website or uses the App or a Club App and sends an enquiry through or makes a comment or other post, through an email or via a social media platform;


  * When a user signs up to receive marketing information;


  * When we evaluate job applicants and personnel, which may include collection of details such as employment history and educational qualifications; and


  * Where you are required to pay to purchase goods or services from us or third parties through the Website, the App or a Club App, we (or a financial services provider engaged by us or a third party) will (or that third party) also collect financial information such as credit card information, your mailing address etc.



A significant amount of personal information is primarily collected by Club App Administrators. However, because the information resides on our database we technically “collect” it, although we would not typically access or analyse it. This information could include a range of information as selected by the Club App Administrator, such as names, dates of birth, address, phone number, occupation, employment details, health information, private insurance status, details of ambulance cover, and other information as selected by the Club App Administrator.

### 2\. Other types of information we collect

We collect information on visitors to the Website, including information on which areas of the Website are most often accessed and how long visitors visit those areas.

We may utilise “cookies” which enable us to monitor traffic patterns and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the Website. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer.

Rejecting cookies may have the effect of limiting your access to parts of the Website.

We may collect information about your computer or device, including where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregated information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
