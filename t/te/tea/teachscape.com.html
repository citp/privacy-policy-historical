<p>Your Privacy. It Matters.</p>
</div>

<p>Teachscape, Inc. ("Teachscape", "we" or "us") understands that individuals
with whom we conduct business value their privacy. Protecting your privacy is
important to us. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By
ensuring that you are aware of and understand the Teachscape Privacy Policy, we
can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following
policy to learn how we handle your personal information.</p>

<p>In general, you can visit the public areas of our website (the "Site")
without divulging any personal information. However, there are areas of our Site
that require this information to complete their customization functions. These
areas are accessible only by registered users, and are known as the "Registered
User Areas". Use of the Registered User Areas is prohibited unless you are a
registered user, and may not be available to those choosing not to reveal the
information requested.</p>

<div class="para-header">
<p>Why We Collect Personal Information</p>
</div>

<p>Teachscape collects and uses your personal information to customize your
experience on our Site, to give you superior customer service, to provide you
with convenient access to our products and services, to respond to your requests
for products or services, and to make a wider range of our products and services
available to you. Persons with access to your user information may include
agents of Teachscape who help us to provide services to you.</p>

<p>In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the
latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, and other
information we think you would like to hear about. Lastly, we may use the
information gathered when you register to use the Registered User Areas (and
when you use those areas) for demographic, research and other analytical
purposes. We may combine the information we collect with information from other
sources. Some of the research and analysis we perform will be shared with
potential clients, educational institutions and systems, service providers and
government agencies; however, we will not identify you personally to any outside
party with regard to any such information.</p>

<div class="para-header">
<p>How We Collect Personal Information</p>
</div>

<p>We collect information about you in several ways. We might ask for your
contact information when you register with our Site, correspond with us,
participate in one of our chat or online communities, call us to request
service, register to attend a seminar, or participate in an online survey. At
certain points throughout our Site, we might ask for your name, e-mail address,
and other contact information. In order to access the registered areas of our
Site, you are required to enter your username and password.</p>

<div class="para-header">
<p>When We Disclose Personal Information</p>
</div>

<p>As a general matter, most of the information that we gather about you will be
used for our internal purposes only. At times we may share information regarding
your use of our Site with your master licensee (e.g., your educational institute
or school district) or the group through which you were provided access to our
Site. Some of the research and analysis we perform will be shared with potential
clients, educational institutions and systems, service providers and government
agencies; however, we will not identify you personally to any outside party with
regard to any such information.</p>

<p>Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, at times we may be
required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may
also disclose information about you if we believe, in good faith, that
disclosure is necessary for the protection of Teachscape or its rights, or the
public.</p>

<div class="para-header">
<p>How We Protect Your Personal Information</p>
</div>

<p>Teachscape uses reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of the data you
send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We attempt to
protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your personal information. If
you are a registered user, remember to sign off of our Site and close your
browser window when you are finished to ensure that others cannot pose as you
online. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when
you are on the internet. Change your password often, use a combination of
letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>

<div class="para-header">
<p>Access to Your Personal Information</p>
</div>

<p>You always have access to the information we have about you. If you would
like to review other personal information that we may have about you, or to
opt-out of future communications, email us at info@teachscape.com.</p>

<div class="para-header">
<p>Collection of Non-Personal Information</p>
</div>

<p>When you browse the unregistered areas of our Site, you are able to do so
anonymously. Generally, we don't collect personal information when you browse
such areas. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of
computer and operating system you are using.</p>

<p>Like many websites, the Teachscape Site uses "cookie" technology. When you
first connect to our Site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique,
random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about
you, except perhaps your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit.
Cookies help us understand which areas of our Site are the most popular, where
our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study
traffic patterns so we can make our Site even better.</p>

<div class="para-header">
<p>Links to Other Websites</p>
</div>

<p>Our Site may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible
for the content of such websites, and your use of the websites is subject to the
privacy policies of those sites.</p>

<div class="para-header">
<p>Your California Privacy Rights</p>
</div>

<p>If you are a California resident, you are entitled to prevent, through a
cost-free means, sharing of your personal information with third-parties for
their own marketing purposes. If you send a written request to Teachscape, Inc.,
71 Stevenson Street, 5th Floor, 94105, Attention: Chief Financial Officer,
Teachscape will provide you with a California Customer Choice Notice that you
can use to opt-out of such information sharing. Please allow thirty days for
response.</p>

<div class="para-header">
<p>Our Companywide Commitment to Privacy</p>
</div>

<p>To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate
these privacy guidelines to every Teachscape employee.</p>

<p>If we are going to use any personal information we have collected in a manner
different from that stated at the time of collection, we will publish notice of
such use on the Site.</p>

<p>The site is not directed to children, and Teachscape does not knowingly
solicit personal information from children under 13.</p>

<p>The Teachscape Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage
you to review the Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your use of the Site
after any such change means you agree to the Privacy Policy as changed.</p>
