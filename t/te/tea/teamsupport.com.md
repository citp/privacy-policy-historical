### 1.      Scope of Privacy Policy

This Policy details our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit our Site (“ **Visitors** ”) and entities or individuals who have subscribed to our Services and agreed to the Terms (“ **Customers** ”). This policy applies to information that is automatically collected via the Site or Services or that is affirmatively provided to us by Visitors or Customers.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to:

  * End-Users. Unless they are also a Visitor or Customer of TeamSupport, individuals and entities who are users of our Customers’ services (“ **End-Users** ”) are not covered under this Privacy Policy. Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal information from End-Users. If you are an End-User, then you will be directed to contact our Customer for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your Personal Data. We collect information under the direction of our Customers and have no direct relationship with End-Users whose personal information we process in connection with our Customer’s use of our Services. If you are an End-User and would either like to amend your contact information or no longer wish to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Services, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly. If your Personal Data is processed within Customer Data, we will process the Personal Data for as long as we are instructed to do so by the Customer that is the data controller of the Personal Data.
  * Offline Information. Information collected by us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by TeamSupport or any third party (including our affiliates and subsidiaries) is not subject to this Privacy Policy.
  * Third Parties. TeamSupport is not responsible for the privacy policies or other practices employed by websites linked to, or from, our Site nor the information or content contained therein, and we encourage you to read the privacy statements of any linked third party.



The Services are intended for use by enterprises. When we process Personal Data on behalf of a Customer, that Customer is the Data Controller of your personal information and TeamSupport is a Data Processor under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). When you visit our Site or use our Services, and we collect information from you, including Personal Data, TeamSupport shall be the Data Controller for the collected data under the GDPR.

### 2.      Information We Collect About You and How We Collect It  

TeamSupport gathers a variety of information about our Site visitors, Customers, and End-Users, including information:

  * by which you may be personally identified, such as name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other identifier by which you may be contacted online or offline (“ **Personal Data** ”);
  * that is about you but individually does not identify you; and
  * about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access our Site or Services and usage details.



We collect this information directly from you when you provide it to us; automatically as you navigate through the site; or from third parties, for example, our business partners.

_Information That You Provide to Us_

Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Please be aware that we cannot control the actions of other users of the Site with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

_Information Automatically Collected Through Your Use of the Site or Services_

As you navigate through and interact with our Site and Services, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and pattern.

It helps us to improve our Site and Services and allows us to deliver a better and more personalized service, including enabling us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns, to store information about your preferences, and to recognize you when you return to our Site.

The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

  * **Cookies (or browser cookies)**. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.

Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve our Site and Services. In such a case, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 5.      Customer Data

“Customer Data” means any and all data, information or material provided or submitted by Customers to TeamSupport by any means, including Personal Data of Customer employees, contractors, and End-Users. We only process Customer Data as per our Customer's instructions. For purposes of the GDPR and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, we are the processor and not the controller of the Customer Data. Our European Economic Area (“ **EEA** ”) or Switzerland based customers are the “controllers” of that data and are responsible for compliance with the applicable data protection law. We work with our Customers to help them provide notice to their End-Users concerning the purpose for which Personal Data is processed by TeamSupport.

As the controller, it is our Customers’ responsibility to inform End-Users about the processing, and, where required, obtain necessary consent or authorization for any Personal Data that is collected as part of the Customer Data. As the processors of Personal Data on behalf of our customers, we follow customer’s instructions with respect to the Customer Data to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Services. In doing so, we implement technical, physical and administrative measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, Personal Data.

### 6.      Data Security: How We Protect Data We Hold

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to secure your Personal Data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Please see our security information page [here.](https://www.teamsupport.com/customer-service-software-security) The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL or TLS technology.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site or Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site and Services like company profile pages or message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Site.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted to the Site or Services. Any transmission of Personal Data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site or Services.

### 7.      International Transfer of Personal Data

TeamSupport stores personal information about visitors and Customers within the United States, the EEA, and in other countries and territories in which we, or our contractors, operate. To provide you with the Site or Services, we may transfer and access such Personal Data from around the world. If you are using the Site or Services from the EEA or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your Personal Data to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Such countries may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country. Whenever we share Personal Data originating in the EEA, we will rely on lawful measures to transfer that data, such as the EU standard contractual clauses. By providing your Personal Data, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 8.      Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data (EEA Only)

With respect to Personal Data collected from individuals from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. Our Company will normally collect Personal Data only where: (a) we have specific consent to do so, (b) where we need the Personal Data to fulfil a contract with a Visitor or Customer, or (c) where the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests (and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms).

If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data). Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time why we need to use your Personal Data. If we process Personal Data in reliance on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please contact us using the contact details provided below.

### 9.      EU-U.S. Privacy Shield

TeamSupport supports both EU-US Privacy Shield Certification and Model Contractual Clauses for data transfer provided in the regulations pertaining to data transfers outside of the EEA.

TeamSupport complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  TeamSupport has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit [www.commerce.gov/privacyshield](http://www.commerce.gov/privacyshield)

In compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles, TeamSupport commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  European Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us via our data protection officer listed below.

TeamSupport has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint.

Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.

### 10.  Choices for Your Personal Data

You can review and change your personal information by visiting your account profile page.

You may also send us an email to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

If you delete User Contributions from the Site or Services, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or might have been copied or stored by other users.

TeamSupport tolerates only permission-based email. In addition, users always have the opportunity to opt– out or change preferences via a link in the footer of all non–transactional email messages. These options are made available in email messages delivered from our company. Some communications, however, are considered transactional and are necessary for all TeamSupport customers (e.g. important account notifications and billing information). You must cancel your TeamSupport account to unsubscribe from transactional communications. 

TeamSupport does not currently respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. Third parties may collect data about your online activities over time and across sites when you visit the Site or use the Services.

### 11.    EEA SPECIFIC RIGHTS
