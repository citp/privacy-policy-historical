## Muroc Systems, Inc. Privacy Policy

Muroc Systems, Inc. ("Muroc") maintains a strict policy to ensure the privacy of our customers and visitors. Simply put, we will not release information about you (including your full name, mailing address, phone number) to any third party without your consent unless:  


  * We are required to under law.
  * The product you are using becomes owned by another party either through a merger or acquisition.
  * Muroc also reserves the right to disclose information to a third party if Muroc is contemplating a business transaction with that third party and the data is relevant to that discussion. Muroc will only release data if the third party is bound by a privacy policy at least as strict at Muroc's.



**Information Gathered**  
Muroc gathers a variety of information about our visitors and customers, including, but not limited to, IP address, referring page, pages visited, and the length of time you spend on the site. In addition, Muroc uses Cookies to both track visitors on the website as well as to remember client's usernames when they log into the application. People who sign up to use one of Muroc's applications (collectively customers) will be required to provide additional information such as address, phone number, and billing information.

**Blogs & User Forums**  
Muroc may provide blogs or user forums on the Company's Web sites. Any personally identifiable information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Muroc is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.  


**Information Uses**  
Muroc may use the information gathered for billing, identification, authentication, service improvements, and contact including internal marketing efforts.

**Security Measures**  
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) when using or accessing Muroc's applications. This encrypts the data being transmitted to and from you and the Muroc application. In addition, billing information is encrypted in our databases for your protection.

**Data Storage**  
Muroc owns the data storage, databases, and all intellectual property rights for our applications, but you retain ownership to all data you input into the system. In addition, all data is backed up multiple times each day and run on redundant servers that are in a secure facility at the Infomart in Dallas where we are located. Only key card access is allowed and there is 24/7/365 electronic and human security in place. Data is backed up locally on another server and is also backed up offsite - as is our code base.

**Changes**  
Muroc may, from time to time, change this privacy policy. If there are material changes to the policy we will either send an e-mail to the registered primary contact of our customers or post a prominent notice on our website.

**Questions**  
If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at 800/586-2820 or via mail at: Muroc Systems, Inc., 100 Highland Park Village, Ste 200, Dallas, TX 75205.
