# Privacy Policy | Teach Away Inc.

## Introduction

Teach Away Inc. (in this policy, “Teach Away”), recognizes the importance of confidentiality and the protection of personal information. This privacy policy explains how we use and protect, on a Canada-wide basis, personal information we hold, whether it relates to our clients, potential clients, staff, internal job candidates, external job placement candidates, consultants or third party service providers.

### What is personal information?

Personal information means information about an identifiable individual or information that permits an individual to be identified. It does not include business contact information, such as name, title, business address and business telephone number when used for business communications.

### Our commitment

Teach Away takes responsibility for maintaining and protecting the personal information under our control. We have appointed a Chief Privacy Officer who can be contacted directly by the public who is responsible for our day to day compliance. We review this policy and our personal data protection practices regularly to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable legislation and current best practices.

### How we collect, use and disclose personal information

We only collect personal information as required to meet the purposes that we have identified. We do not indiscriminately collect or retain personal information.

Teach Away typically collects personal information that is voluntarily provided by the individual in question. At times, however, personal information is obtained from other sources, such as government bodies or third parties such as employers, references and service providers, as permitted by law. Where the purpose for the collection of personal information is unclear, you can ask the Teach Away representative with whom you are dealing to provide an explanation of the purpose for the data collection.  
Our reason for collecting personal information about job candidates, clients, staff and consultants is to establish and maintain the employment, contractual or other business relationship.  
The purpose for collecting personal information about prospective placement candidates is primarily to provide recruitment services and representation, to maintain client and candidate relationships, communicate effectively with our clients and candidates and maintain mailing lists.

As appropriate, Teach Away will ask for specific consent to collect, use and disclose personal information, including for the purposes of completing or arranging for the completion of background checks and searches. This may be in writing or orally. In some cases, consent can be implied through an individual relationship or conduct with us, depending on the sensitivity of the information.  
Personal information supplied to us is confidential and we do not disclose the information to any third party except with actual or implied consent, or as permitted or required by law. We do not exchange or sell personal information.  
Teach Away may use third party service providers from time to time to carry out certain functions for us such as printing, storage, shredding or document scanning. Where we use such outside service providers, we require those third parties to protect personal information in the same manner in which we protect it and to not use or disclose it for any purposes except as directed by Teach Away.

### Protecting your personal information

We strive to maintain personal information in as accurate, complete and up-to-date a form as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We protect personal information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information, regardless of format. Our security safeguards include premises security and restricted access to files containing personal information. Depending upon the information under our control, we also use technological safeguards such as security software and firewalls to prevent hacking or unauthorized computer access, internal passwords and security policies.

We reserve the right to confirm your identity before complying with any access request. In responding to an access request, we may charge a reasonable copying or retrieval fee, the amount of which we will provide in advance. Access to personal information may be denied if required or authorized by law. If a request for access is denied, Teach Away will provide an explanation of the reasons for the refusal.

If you choose to withdraw your consent to continued collection, use or retention of your personal information, we will explain the consequences of such withdrawal.
