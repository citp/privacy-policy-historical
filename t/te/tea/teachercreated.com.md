# Teacher Created Resources: Security and Privacy

**How will the security and privacy of my transaction be ensured?**  
At Teacher Created Resources, we recognize that the privacy of your personal information is of the highest importance. When making purchases on our Web site, you can be assured that all personal or confidential information is collected and stored in a highly secure manner. 

**Is it safe to use my credit card online?**  
Yes. The servers we use are completely secure and all of the transactions you complete over the Internet are fully encrypted in SSL to completely protect all of the information you provide. When on a secure Web page you should see the security icon on your browser's status bar light up and lock, or some other security-notifying feature on your browser enable itself. 

**What does 'encryption' mean and how does it work in relation to my order?**  
All aspects of the Teacher Created Resources online catalog system that collect or transmit personal or billing information are protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption (the Internet standard for secure transactions). When your order is processed over the Internet the information is sent in a scrambled (encrypted) format. Because the information is protected by SSL encryption, unauthorized parties are unable to decode the information making the transaction completely safe and secure. 

**What information do you need to collect from me?**  
We gather personally identifiable information from you during checkout, when you register for our newsletter, or when you contact our company by e-mail or submitting a form on our site. This information may include: your name, mailing and billing addresses, e-mail address, credit card number and expiration date, and responses to specific questions (i.e. what grade you teach). 

**Do you share my information with other companies?**  
We share information with third parties that are essential for our operations or provide service to our customers (shipping companies and credit card processing). 

Periodically, we may share your information with a select few companies who would like to send you special offers or information. If you prefer not to receive mail from other companies, please contact us and let us know. If you prefer not to receive e-mail from other companies, you can indicate this when you subscribe to our e-mail newsletter by selecting the "Opt Out" option. You can also use this [Subscribe](https://web.archive.org/subscribe/) form to change your e-mail preferences at any time. 

**What safeguards do you have in place to ensure the privacy of my order and personal information?**  
When on a secure Web page, you should see the security icon on your browser's status bar light up and lock, or some other security-notifying feature on your browser enable itself.
