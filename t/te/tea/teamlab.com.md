##  Information Collection 

Ascensio System SIA collects information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") in case you choose to register with TeamLab service. We require your first and last names, as well as your email address in order to authenticate users and provide access to TeamLab accounts.

If you choose not to register or provide Personal Information, you can still use our website anonymously. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration.

We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your time spent at our website, and to gather broad demographic information. This allows us to see which parts of our website users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means, for instance, that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will remain anonymous. We do not use this information for any other purposes.

##  Use of Personal Information 

When a user submits Personal Information, it is kept on a private server not accessible from the Internet. This limits the possibility of any malicious use of your Personal Information.

However, we will not share any individual customer information outside of the contracted partners and third parties without first receiving the individual's prior written approval. In short, Ascensio System Limited does not sell registrant information to lists.
