## Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites

**TeacherTube** allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the **TeacherTube** Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the **TeacherTube** Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.

**TeacherTube** does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks TeacherTube to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the TeacherTube Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. **TeacherTube's** privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

## Our Commitment To Data Security

**TeacherTube** uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to **TeacherTube** and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, **TeacherTube** makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If **TeacherTube** learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. **TeacherTube** may post a notice on the **TeacherTube** Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.   


## Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, **TeacherTube** does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the **TeacherTube** Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the **TeacherTube** Sites at any time or in any manner. If **TeacherTube** learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the **TeacherTube** Sites without verified parental consent, then TeacherTube will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
