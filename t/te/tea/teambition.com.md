We will automatically collect some of your information when you browse and use our services (such as browsing our website or doing an appropriate operation on our web page). 

1\. Your use in our products: when you access and interact with any of our services, we will track some of your information. This information includes any functions you are using such as clicking on tasks, selecting teams or clicking on other links, and any attachments you upload to the service system and their types, sizes and names, and any search terms you often use and how you interact with others in our products. We also collect any information about the teams and people with whom you work and the way in which you interact with them, such as the people with whom you work and communicate most frequently.

This device information includes connection types and settings when you install, access, update or use our services. We also collect any information about your operating systems, browser types, IP addresses, URLs for sharing/exit from web page, device identifiers and application to data related to software crash through your devices. We also use your IP addresses and national or regional preferences to estimate your location so as to provide a better service experience.

3\. Cookies and other tracking techniques: Teambition and our third party partners (such as our analysis partners) may use Cookie and other tracking techniques (such as typing on web pages) to identify your identity. Cookie is a text-only message string, and the website will transfer these strings to a browser Cookie file of the computer hard disk so that the website can remember your identity information and other details. Cookie may be set up by a website or sourced from third parties such as advertisers. Cookie itself is not used or intended to be used to read any information from a user’s computer (other than the contents of Cookie itself). Cookie is only the identifier used by a website that is initially placed on your hard disk. The same server can retrieve the actual contents of Cookie information and then identify the computer and customize, track or control the usage of the site according to the information stored on the primary server. We will use these tracking tools to help you make better use of Teambition and help us improve the corresponding functions. You can choose to accept or reject Cookie by modifying browser settings. However, if you disable Cookie, you will not be able to use Teambition’s interactive features. 

#### Information we collect from other sources

We will collect any information about you from other users we are serving, other third party service providers and related companies and our business and channel partners.

1\. Other users we are serving: other users we are serving may provide any information about you when submitting their service content. For example, writing your name in task remarks or mentioning your information in a chat. We will also collect your email address from other service users to invite you to join the service. Similarly, your enterprise administrator may specify you as project manager or team administrator (by logging in to your email or phone) so that your team members can contact you when needed. 

2\. Other services you associate with your account: we will collect any information about you when you enable Github, WeChat or other third-party applications or associate third-party services with our services. For example, if you use WeChat credentials to create an account or log in to the service, we will receive your name and other information based on the license set for your personal WeChat data to verify your identity. You or your administrator may also associate our services with other services you use, such as allowing you to access, store, share, and edit some contents from third parties through our services. For example, you can authorize our services to access and display files from third-party document sharing services (such as Office365, graphite documents) in the service interface. Alternatively, you can authorize our server to access and display files (such as office365 and Graphite documents) from third-party document sharing services in the service interface or to synchronize contact lists or address books so that you can easily contact the contacts in the service or invite them to collaborate with us on services. Any information we collect when linking or associating our services with third party services depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policies under control of these third party services. Therefore, You should always pay close attention to and understand the privacy settings and notifications in these third-party services to learn about any data that may be disclosed to us or shared with our services. 

3\. Teambition’s partners: We are working with our partners and will carry out single sign-on, data access, training and other services around our products and partners’ products.

#### III. How do we use the information collected 

How we use the information collected depends in part on the services you use, how we use them and the preferences you set. Here are the specific purposes for which we use the information collected about you: 

1\. For providing you with better service and personalized experience: we use information about you to provide services to you, including identifying where you are logged in, what user support should be provided and how to operate and maintain the overall service. For example, we use the names and pictures (such as head portraits) you provide in your account to identify you to other service users. Our services also include personalizing your experience and customized features, improving your efficiency in using Teambition, improving the ability and efficiency of others to communicate and collaborate with you through automated analysis and calculation and better helping you to build a solid and accurate relationship with your team. We may use your email domain to extrapolate your connections to a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our site. 

2\. For research and development iteration: we have been looking for ways to make our services help you get a better user experience in a smarter, faster, safer and more integrated and effective manner. We learn through collective study about how people use our services and constantly collect feedback from users directly to us to help us troubleshoot problems and identify product trends, usage, activity patterns and ways to integrate and improve services. For example, at each iteration and update, we record the usage of new features and users use links to design better and more humane features. In some cases, we will provide this part of the survey data and research data to the corresponding research institutions to carry out deeper product research and academic research. 

3\. For improving communication with users: we will use your contact information to send transaction emails via email and service content, including confirming your purchase, reminding you of the expiration of your subscription, responding to your opinions, questions and needs, providing customer support and sending you updates and notifications and warnings. Depending on your settings, when you or someone else interacts in a service, we will send you an email notification, for example, when you are mentioned in a task or are added to a task. 

4\. For technical services: we use your information to solve your technical problems, respond to your requests for assistance, analyze crash information and make repairs and improve services. If you allow us to do so, we will share your information with Teambition’s technical experts to respond to and support related requests. 

5\. For enhancing security protection and authentication: we use information about you and your service usage to verify accounts and activities, monitor suspicious or fraudulent activities and determine whether the above actions are contrary to the service policy.

6\. For protecting our legitimate commercial interests and other legitimate rights and interests: where the law requires or we deem it necessary to protect our legitimate rights and interests and the interests of others, we will use information about you to handle legal proceedings, compliance, regulatory and audit-related matters and disclosures related to acquisitions, mergers or sales.

7\. Legitimacy of data processing: If you are a user in the EU region, we will only legally collect and process your information in accordance with the applicable EU law, and the legitimacy depends on the services you use and how you use them. This means that we will only collect and use your information in the following cases: we need to process data to provide you with our services, including operational services, provision of customer support, personalized feature and security of services; data processing is necessary for the realization of legitimate interests (unless the data protection benefits you enjoy take precedence over these interests), such as for research and development, marketing and promotion services and protecting our legitimate rights and interests; you agree to process data for a specific purpose; we need to process your data to fulfill our legal obligations. 

If you have agreed that we use your information for a specific purpose, you will also have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. When we or third parties (such as your employers) legally use your information, you will have the right to object to it. However, in some cases, this may mean that you will no longer use the services. 

#### IV. How do we share the information collected

We develop and provide collaboration tools that we hope will better help you with your work. This means that we will share the information collected through services or third parties. We will share the information we have collected about you, including any information related to possible business transfers, but we promise never to sell your information to advertisers or other third parties. 

#### Share with other users in the service

1\. For collaboration or cooperation: You can create tasks or other contents that contain your information and add the access authority granted to others or the rights granted to others to share, edit, duplicate and download. When you share or interact with specific content, some of collaboration features of the service will display some or all of personal information to other service users. For example, when you comment on a task, we will display your avatar and name next to your comment so that other users who have access to the task know who made the comment. Similarly, when you join a team or organization, your name, profile pictures and contact information will appear in the list of other team members so that they can find you and interact with you. Please note that some tasks or projects can be set to public, which means that anything published on the project (including any information about you) can be publicly viewed. You can check your project settings at any time to verify that a particular project is public. 

2\. Forum community: our website provides publicly accessible blogs, forums and error trackers. Any information you provide on these sites, including any personal information related to the account number used to publish information, may be read, collected and used by any member of the public visiting these sites even if you terminate your account and posts, some profile information may also be retained. We recommend that you consider the security and privacy of this information when you enter it.

#### Share with third-party partners

We share information with third parties to help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and sell our services.

1\. Third party applications: You or your administrator or other service users can choose to add new features or work by enabling the application center in the service. This may give third party applications access to your account and information (such as your name and email address) and anything you choose to be relevant to these applications. Third party application policies and procedures are not under our control. This privacy policy does not include how third party applications use your information. You should always pay close attention to and learn about privacy settings and notifications in these third party services for more information about their privacy and information processing. If you object to sharing your information with these third parties, please disable these third party applications. 

2\. Links to third party websites: services may contain links to your other sites or services that may differ from ours in their privacy practices.

#### Share with affiliates

In some cases, we will share the information we collect with our affiliates. Affiliates are the companies owned or operated by us. We share your information with our affiliates to operate and improve products and services and provide you with other related services. This privacy policy applies to the information we share in these cases. 

#### V. How do we store the information collected and ensure its security

Storage and security of information: we use cloud services provided by AliCloud to put the information we have collected in trust and use technical measures to protect your data. Although we do our utmost to protect your information security, because of the inherent nature of the Internet, no system is absolutely secure, and we can not guarantee the absolute security of your data in the course of transmission over the Internet and when stored in our system. We will do everything possible to prevent against security incursions. However, if such an event occurs, we will inform you as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. 

#### How long will the information be stored

How long the information will be stored depends on the type of the information that we describe in detail below. After the information has been stored for a certain period, we will delete your information or process it anonymously.

1\. Account information: we will keep your account information until you delete your account. We will also retain some necessary information to fulfill our legal obligations, resolve disputes, perform agreements, support business operations and continue to develop and improve our services. If we are going to keep this information for service improvements and product iterations, we will desensitize the data and only use this information for collective analysis rather than specialized analysis of your personal data. 

2\. Information you share in our service: if your account has been disabled or deactivated, some of your information and the contents you provide will be retained so that your team members or other users can make full use of the service. For example, we will continue to display comments and contents you provide to a project or task.
