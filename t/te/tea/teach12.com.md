# The Teaching Company - Privacy Policy

Our Privacy Policy

  * How we protect your billing information >

**How we protect your name, address, and e-mail address **   
We will not sell or rent your name, address, e-mail address, or purchase history to any other person or company. Period. That has been our policy since we opened in 1990. 

We use your name and address to send you course materials you order, our catalogs, and newsletters. 

Here's what we do with your e-mail address: 

  * **Send you order confirmations and course starter materials**. When you place an order, you'll receive an order confirmation within moments. You'll also receive the professor's summary of the course, links to websites recommended by the professor to supplement your learning experience, and the recommended readings for the course with a link so you may order the readings if you choose. 
  * **Send you free articles**. We search widely for articles of interest on the subjects covered by our courses. When we find one that is especially interesting and compelling, we'll send it to you if we can arrange with the publisher to do so. 
  * **Collect your feedback on courses and professors**. We work hard to stay in touch with you. Through e-mail surveys, you vote for the courses you want us to make, rate the quality of our courses, tell us what improvements to make to our courses and services, and tell us which professors we should choose to make The Great Courses. The professors who teach The Great Courses were chosen based on the votes of more than 15,000 customers who have evaluated audition lectures. 
  * **Notify you of special offers**. Each catalog and newsletter includes courses that are on sale. We also notify our customers via e-mail when courses are on sale. We also make buying simple via e-mail. If you see courses that interest you, simply click on the links to our website, where you can find out more.

**How we protect your billing information**   
When you order from us online, we protect your information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.  We are secured by VeriSign, the leading provider of SSL encryption keys. SSL encryption electronically masks any information you send us. With this state-of-the-art system, you can enter your credit card number and delivery and billing information safely. The encryption process protects the information by scrambling it before it is sent to us. 

You can verify our compliance at any time by clicking on the VeriSign logo located on our Shopping Cart page or any page in the checkout process.
