# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. We provide this policy to better protect you, and to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

This privacy policy applies to all Team Liquid website properties, including teamliquid.net, liquipedia.net, liquidhearth.com, liquiddota.com, liquidlegends.net, teamliquidpro.com and any standalone partner websites that are made by us.

## The Information We Collect and Use

During user registration, we collect the following information:

Username  
Email address (if provided)  
IP address  
Country

The username you supply will be used as a public identifier when posting content to our website. An email address is required to register on our website as login details and password reset requests will be sent to it. Your email address will never be publicly displayed on any part of the website, but it will be visible to Team Liquid staff for purposes of contacting you directly about your account and identifying common spambot emails. Your IP address is recorded and visible only to our staff for the purposes of monitoring abuse resulting from multiple registrations under the same IP address, spam bots, unsolicited advertisers, etc. Your country is shown publicly on your posts, you may update or remove the country display from you user control panel.

If you subscribe to our Team Liquid newsletter, after a confirmation of opt-in your email address will be shared with our email delivery partner (SparkPost) on publication of each newsletter in order to send it to you. Outside of these stated purposes, your email address will never be shared with 3rd parties in any form, including so-called pseudonymous "hashed emails" which are used by data brokers.

If you register using a 3rd party service such as a social media site (Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, Steam, etc), upon your consent that 3rd party will provide us with a unique identifier so that we may identify you on future logins. We do not store your social media username or any other details that may incidentally be provided to us when using social media logins. Your social media username will be used during the first login in order to provide you with a recommended username on our website.

As part of our site features, we offer a forum and other features on which you can freely post any text. If you choose to disclose personally identifying information, be aware that Team Liquid is a public web site and anyone is able to read your posts, so there is no expectation of privacy for user-generated content. Where applicable, we will moderate any posts that violate EU law in regards to information disclosed about other individuals.

The website features a private messaging system which allows you to send message to other users on the website. The messages you exchange over the private messaging system can only be read by the recipient user account or Team Liquid administrators. The Team Liquid administrators will only access private message details if they suspect the message might be spam / advertising or otherwise malicious in nature, or if required to do so by law. We are not responsible for any disclosure of private message contents by the recipient.

As an optional feature of the user profile page, you may upload an image such as a photo of yourself. This image will be visible to other users through your Team Liquid profile page. At any time, you can modify or delete this image through your user profile settings.

During your usage of the website, your browser will open connections and send requests to our web server. The server will log each request with your IP address, date and time, status code, browser version (user agent), HTTP referrer and the resource requested. These logs are used for internal troubleshooting purposes, such as discovering if a certain IP address is causing excessive HTTP error codes, or if a certain resource is not functioning correctly. Logs are only visible to Team Liquid system administrators and are erased after 52 days.
