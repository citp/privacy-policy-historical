Your privacy and security are very important to us at Teachers Pay Teachers. We’re committed to transparency when it comes to our privacy practices and how we safeguard your information. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines what kinds of information we may ask you for and gather from you as you visit or use TpT, how that information may be used, and under what circumstances certain information might be shared with others. 

This Policy applies to the data you share when you use our “Services” which includes our website at TeachersPayTeachers.com and any affiliated web pages or forms we may create or host (“Site”), our mobile applications (“Apps”), or when you communicate with us.

This Policy is part of our Terms of Service which you can find [here](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Next-Terms-of-Service). 

## Information We Collect

Some information collected when you use our services is considered “Personal Information” (or PI). This is information that can be used to identify you personally and includes things like your full name, your street address, your phone number, and your email address. Other than as provided for in this Policy, we won’t share or disclose this kind of information unless we get your permission. Other information that we collect may not identify you personally. This kind of information may be shared or disclosed in an aggregate form, used to personalize your experience, and so on.

All Members.  To use many aspects of our Services, you’re required to create a TpT account and become a Member. To become a Member, we require that you pick a unique username, and provide us with your email address so we can contact you. We may also ask you to tell us your name so we know who you are. 

Finally we may ask you to share some information about what kind of user you are (your role), your geographic location, what and where you teach, and information about your interests to help us personalize your experience using our Services.

B. PURCHASE INFORMATION

When you make a purchase through our Services, you’ll need to provide billing and payment information to complete your order. We’ve carefully chosen Service Providers who use Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant practices to process payments (“Payment Processors”). Whether you check out using a credit or debit card, PayPal account, or any other payment method we may support, your payment will be processed directly by our Payment Processor and we’ll never have access to or store your full payment details.

When you use a credit or debit card to pay for your purchases, you’ll be asked to add a credit or debit card payment source ("Payment Card"). When you submit your order, this information will be sent directly to and stored by our Payment Processor. After your payment is processed, the Payment Processor will send TpT some details about the transaction so that we can record your order in our database and provide access to the materials that you purchased. 

The Payment Card you added will be available for future use on your Account. You can edit or remove this information at any time by navigating to the checkout page or by [contacting us](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Contact) for assistance.

If you choose to pay using PayPal, you’ll log in to your PayPal account to complete your order. When PayPal processes your payment, they’ll send us a confirmation with transaction details so we can record your order and provide access to the Resources or services you’ve purchased. We do not collect information about or have access to the specific payment or funding sources or any other financial account details associated with your PayPal account.
