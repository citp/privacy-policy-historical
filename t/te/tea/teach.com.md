## Collection of Information

### Information You Provide

2U collects information from you when you choose to provide it to us. For example, we collect your information when you submit a form requesting information about the Program or about other programs offered at other schools, when you fill out an application, or otherwise contact us or provide information to us through the Website. The information we collect includes personal information – such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, prior educational background information, application content (such as transcripts, essays, and recommendations), and the content of any communications that we exchange – and non-personal information. In some cases, we require your personal information in order to perform a contract or to comply with a legal obligation.

### Information Automatically Collected

When you visit the Website or interact with e-mails that we send to you, we passively collect information from you, including your internet protocol address ("IP address"), browser type, operating system, device identifier, device model, software version, or mobile or ISP carrier information. We also use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your visit to the Website, such as the date and time of your visit, the information you searched to find the Website, or your activity on the Website. "Cookies" are small files which may be stored on your computer during your use of the Website and contain data about your use of the Website. We use session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them or after a specified expiry date) to understand more about your activity on the Website. 

### Tracking Options and California Do Not Track Disclosures.

You may adjust your browser or operating system settings to limit tracking or to decline cookies. If you choose to limit tracking or decline cookies, however, you may be unable to access certain areas of the Website.

### Information Collected from Other Sources

Where permitted by law, we collect or receive information about you from other sources with which you interact (e.g., Facebook or LinkedIn), companies that are our partners, or other or other entities within the 2U family of companies to update or supplement the information that you provide or that we collect automatically. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services or other offers that may be of interest to you, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.

### Our Combination of Your Information

We combine the information we receive from and about you via the Website and from third parties to help us tailor our communications to you and to improve the Website.

### Failure to Provide Personal Information

Failure to provide certain information may make it difficult or impossible for you to access some services through the Website (for example, to register for and complete a Program). You will need to ensure that personal information submitted to us is accurate and up-to-date. For example, we need a current email address to communicate with you about the Program in which you are enrolled.

## How We Disclose Your Information

2U shares your information with other entities or individuals in the following limited circumstances:

  1. **The School:** We share your information with the School in order to process your information (such as your application materials) and/or to fulfill our contracted responsibilities to the School. Once 2U shares your application materials (or, if you are a recommender, your recommendation) with the School, 2U does not maintain control over the School's use of your application (or recommendation). We also share de-identified aggregate, pseudonymous, or anonymous information with the School for their own research and analytics purposes. The School's use of your information will be subject to its privacy policy.
  2. **The 2U Family of Companies:** Where you have expressed interest and given your consent, we share your information within the 2U family of companies to provide you with information about other educational programs.
  3. **Service Providers:** We share your information with third parties that provide business, professional, or technical support functions for us. In particular, we use third-party providers for website hosting, maintenance, marketing services, courier services, certification services, business operations, payment services, and identity verification services ("Service Providers"). These Service Providers are only given access to your information to the extent necessary to process your information and/or provide services to 2U, and they are prohibited from using or sharing your information for any other purposes. Where permitted by law, 2U discloses limited information about you to Service Providers to serve relevant advertising on third party platforms to you or to other audiences.
  4. **Your Employer** : We share your information with your employer, in the event that the employer is paying for your Program. Information disclosed in this case shall include Program performance information, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing with 2U.
  5. **Legal Matters; Safety:** We access or share your information to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety; as permitted by law; or otherwise as required by law. We disclose your information to protect the security of the Program, the Website, servers, network systems, and databases. We also disclose your information as necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use/) (including investigation of potential violations thereof), any other legal document or contract related to the Website, or the rights of any third party.
  6. **Fraud; Security:** We access and disclose your information to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or other technical issues.
  7. **Consent; Other:** We share information with third parties when we have your consent, or otherwise as described to you at the point of collection.
  8. **Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets:** 2U may sell or purchase assets during the normal course of our business. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use your information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
  9. **International Transfers:** We transfer personal information from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to other countries, including the United States and South Africa. Where information is transferred outside the EEA to a third party in a country that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, data is adequately protected by Standard Contractual Clauses, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification or a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request to privacy@2u.com.



For California Residents: If you do not want 2U to disclose your information to third parties (including affiliated third parties which may not share the 2U name, such as our University Partners) for their direct marketing purposes, you may opt out of such disclosure by [contacting us](mailto:privacy@2U.com) at privacy@2U.com.

## Information Security and Data Retention

We are committed to protecting the security of your information. We maintain what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure your information and to prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and ensure appropriate use of your information. The accuracy, safety, and security of your information also depend on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask that you not share your password with anyone. Even though we do our best to protect your information, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure, and we cannot guarantee our security measures. We are not responsible for any unauthorized access to or acquisition of your information.

We retain your personal information for as long as we have a relationship with you. We also may retain your personal information for longer period of time which enables us to:

  * Maintain business records for analysis and/or audit purposes;
  * Comply with record retention requirements under the law;
  * Defend or bring any existing or potential legal claims;
  * Deal with any complaints regarding the services;
  * Enforce our commercial agreements;
  * Support our legitimate interests, as described in this Privacy Policy.



## Accessing and Managing Your Personal Information

If you have created an application, you may access and/or update your personal information through your user profile.

In some instances, you may be eligible to (a) ask us for a copy of your personal information; (b) correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal information; and/or (c) obtain the personal information you provide to us in a structured, machine readable format. In addition, you may have the right under applicable law to object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances.

Your rights regarding your personal information may be limited in certain circumstances, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person or would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights), or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. We will inform you of the relevant exemption upon which we rely when responding to any request you make.

Our use of certain personal information is necessary for us to provide information to you about the Program or to provide services to you through the Website or otherwise. If you choose not to provide this personal information or request that 2U delete or restrict the processing of this personal information, you may not be able to participate in the Program, and we may not be able to provide you with other services, including those provided through the Website or advertised about the Program.

If you believe your rights regarding your personal information have been infringed upon, please contact us as set forth in the "Additional Information" section below. If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland and have unresolved concerns, you also have a right to lodge a complaint with the applicable data protection authorities.

If you wish to access or delete your information as described in this section, please fill out [2U's Data Request Form](https://2u-datarequest.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/create/35).

In some cases, we may know that you clicked on a social plugin, such as a Twitter Follow button, or receive other information from the social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided personal information to a third party operating a plug-in on our Website, then such third party may recognize you on our Website.
