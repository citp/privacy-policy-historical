2U may share Your Information with other entities or individuals outside of 2U in the following limited circumstances: (1) with your consent; (2) to our Service Providers (as defined in Section 4 of this Privacy Policy), if the disclosure will enable them to perform a business, professional, or technical support function for us; (3) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (4) as necessary, to enforce the Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (5) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; (6) to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of 2U, Website users, or other third party or parties, as required or permitted by law; (7) to our select partners and affiliates that we believe may have offers of interest to you; and (8) as described to you at the point of collection.

2U may also share de-identified information in an aggregated or anonymized manner with third parties for their marketing or analytics uses.
