        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><i>(Effective February 1, 2015)</i></p>
        <p>Teachers' Curriculum Institute knows that you care how information about you is used and shared.  Accordingly, we want you to know and understand our privacy practices with regard to this website (this "Website").  Specifically, this Privacy Policy ("Policy" or "Privacy Policy") discloses the privacy practices of Teachers' Curriculum Institute including:</p>
        <ul class="bullet_list" style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
        	<li>What information of yours is collected via this Website;</li>
        	<li>How that information is used;</li>
        	<li>With whom the information may be shared; </li>
        	<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; and </li>
        	<li>How you can contact us regarding this Privacy Policy and your personal information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to personally identifiable information collected online via this Website.  When this Policy uses the term "personally identifiable information" or "personal information," we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card number.  When other information is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Policy.   Teachers' Curriculum Institute is sometimes referred to herein as "we," "us," or "our."  The term "you," "your" or "yourself" shall refer to the user who is browsing this Website.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this Website.  When you access or use this Website, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  By providing personal information to the Website, all users fully understand and consent to the collection and processing of such information by Teachers' Curriculum Institute.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Information Collected</h2>

        <h3 class="italic" style="margin-top: 5px;">Personal Information:</h3>
        <p>Like many websites, Teachers' Curriculum Institute collects personal information from you when you voluntarily provide it to us by (i) utilizing the "Contact" feature on our Website, (ii) emailing us, (iii) registering for use of the Website or (iv) submitting purchases on the Website.  We may collect any personal information that you provide to us, including, but not limited to, your name and e-mail address.</p>

        <h3 class="italic">Non-personal information; Cookies:</h3>
        <p>In general, you can visit this Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. As part of the standard operation of our Website, we may passively collect certain non-personal information from you including, but not limited to, your browser type (e.g., Firefox or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), Internet Service Provider ("ISP"), IP address, web sites visited and the domain name from which you accessed the Website (e.g., yahoo.com).  In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visited our Website, the areas or pages of our Website that you visit, the amount of time spent viewing our Website, the number of times you return to our Website and other click-stream data. </p>
        <p>Further, most websites use "cookies" and we may as well.  A cookie is a bit of information (a small text file) that is stored on a visitor's hard drive and enables the server to recognize your computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of this Website. Cookies help us learn how groups of people use the Website, and help us collect information to track usage patterns, browsing behavior and assess web content and structure.  We do not use cookies to obtain your name or any personal information. TCI only uses cookies to support the internal operations of its website.</p>
        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  If you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your web browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie and how to erase cookies from a computer's hard drive.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Third Party Vendors</h2>
        <p>Teachers' Curriculum Institute may engage third-party vendors to provide various services relating to the Website, including, without limitation, development, marketing and research services, and Teachers' Curriculum Institute may disclose to such vendors information about individual users that is necessary for performing the services. To protect your privacy, we require our vendors to maintain the confidentiality of any personal information and do not authorize our vendors to retain, use or disclose any personal information for any purpose other than the performance of the services that they provide to Teachers' Curriculum Institute.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Teachers' Curriculum Institute complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").  COPPA requires that website operators never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.  We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children. If we discover personal data from a child under the age of 13, we will eliminate that data. Under the 2013 revisions to COPPA, persistent identifiers like cookies may be considered personal information if they can trace users across sites and over time. TCI cookies are encrypted and cannot be recognized by any other website. TCI only uses cookies to support the internal operations of its website.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Notice to School Districts, Teachers, other Purchasers and Parents</h2>
        <p>Teachers' Curriculum Institute collects limited information from students accessing its websites, including students' first initials, last names, usernames and passwords. Teachers' Curriculum Institute does not use this student information for any purpose other than to enable usage of its subscriptions. It will not sell, rent, or transfer any student information to any third party. It will not grant access to student information to any third party vendor other than to support the internal operations of Teachers' Curriculum Institute's website. It will protect student information subject to FERPA, per FERPA requirements. Teachers' Curriculum Institute does not use student information for any marketing or advertising purpose. All student user information is deleted on an annual basis.</p>

<br>
        <h2>Special Notice to Children</h2>
        <p>Ask your parent or guardian for permission before you send any personal information over the Internet.</p>
<br>
        <h2>Use of Collected Information</h2>

        <p>Information that we collect from you regarding your browser type, operating system, ISP, IP address, web sites visited and the domain name from which you accessed this Website is not used by us to personally identify you.

If you are concerned, please consider the privacy policies on the third-party website before registering with or navigating those sites. </p>
