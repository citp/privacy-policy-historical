Our privacy policy

Teachers Federation Health is committed to protecting the information about you which it holds and uses. The following information outlines how we manage your personal information in accordance with the National Privacy Principles that are set out in the Privacy Act (Cth) 1988 (as amended).

_How we collect and use your personal information_

We will only collect information that is necessary for us to provide you with insurance products and services. This includes, but is not limited to, information necessary for us to provide you with insurance cover, underwrite insurance policies and process claims.

The types of personal information we collect and hold will depend on the product or service you request but may include:

  * Name and address
  * Age
  * Details of previous insurance.
  * Details of your spouse or partner (if on policy).
  * Health information.



Wherever possible, we will collect information directly from you. If you choose not to provide us with the requested information, we may not be able to process your request. It is your responsibility to advise us of any changes to your personal details to ensure we can keep our records accurate and up to date. Where we collect information from a third party, we will advise you of this as soon as possible after the event.

We will not track your internet activity when you visit our website.

_Protecting and maintaining your personal information_

We will use the information we collect to provide you with the insurance product or service you request. We may share your personal information with affiliated organisations, however the information will always be used in accordance with our policies as stated.

We may disclose your information to other insurers, other parties as required by law, or to third party service providers such as investigators and assessors who are contractually required to comply with our privacy obligations.

We will take all reasonable steps to protect the information we hold about you from unauthorised access, use and disclosure. We will destroy your information when it is no longer needed. We do not use any form of encryption (encoding software to protect information you send from your computer to us over the internet). If you use our internet site, you should be aware of the risks associated with this.

If you wish to access the information we hold about you, contact our customer service centre on 1300 728 188. Where possible, your request will be dealt with immediately although you may need to complete an access request form for more complex requests. Whenever you are dealing with us, you should provide your member number as the first source of identification. If the information we hold about you is not accurate or complete, please advise us so we can amend it.
