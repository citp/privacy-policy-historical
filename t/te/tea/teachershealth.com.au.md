# Privacy | Teachers Health Fund

## Our privacy policy

At Teachers Federation Health Ltd ABN 86 097 030 414 trading as Teachers Health Fund (THF), we recognise the importance of your privacy. We observe our privacy obligations under the _Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)_ and other relevant state legislations dealing with privacy and health records, as amended from time to time.

## What personal information do we collect?

From time to time, we may collect personal information about you such as your name, address, phone number, email address, gender, marital status, date of birth, claims history, income tier and information regarding products and services you inquire about or obtain through us so that we can provide you with insurance cover or other services such as eye care or dental care.

We may also collect your bank account details and information in respect of insurance policies in order to provide you with our services.

We may need to obtain sensitive information such as your medical history or other health or lifestyle information, racial or ethnic origin, genetic information that is not health information or information regarding your membership of a trade union – in order to provide you with our health insurance services and other services.

We may collect details of your teachers’ union membership including your union membership number and the status of your membership – to assess whether you are eligible for membership of THF.

We do not collect any of your sensitive information without your consent unless the collection of such information is required by law.

## How we collect your personal information

We may collect this personal information when you:

  * give it to us directly by visiting our branches or our dental and eye care centres, provide information to us by phone or provide information to us in writing such as by completing our forms;
  * use our products and services;
  * visit our website teachershealth.com.au or any other website operated by us; or
  * register to use our online or mobile member services.



We may collect your personal information from third parties in some situations:

  * we may be supplied with your personal information from third parties such as from our partner organisations such as trade unions, “employers plus” providers, hospitals, Medicare or financial institutions;
  * if you transfer your health insurance to us from a previous service provider, we may require your personal information from your previous service provider;
  * we may collect some sensitive information about you, such as medical information, from third parties such as your dentist or doctor.



## Cookies

We use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use this website. A cookie is a small amount of information which is transferred to the hard drive of your computer which can identify your web browser but not you. If you want to, you can disable your web browser from accepting cookies. If you do, you can still access our website, but not all services may be available.

## What happens if you do not provide us with your personal information?

You do not have to provide your personal information to us. However, if you do not provide personal information which we request from you, it affects our service to you. This includes:

  * we may not be able to provide you with insurance or administer your insurance policies;
  * we may not be able to process, manage or pay out on your insurance claims;
  * we may not be able to provide you with health services such as [eyecare](http://www.teachershealth.com.au/eyecare/ "Teachers Eyecare") and dental services;
  * our third party service providers such as doctors, optometrists and dentists may not be able to provide you with services;
  * we may not be able to properly assess your health and lifestyle needs;
  * you may not be able to access our online or mobile member services.



## Use of your personal information

We may use your personal information in a number of ways such as:

  * to provide health insurance and related products and services to you;
  * to manage our relationship with you;
  * for our own internal and marketing purposes;
  * for the purposes related to the reason you gave us the information;
  * as may be required by law;
  * to provide or arrange for associated services to be provided to you such as dental services, eye care services or other insurance or health related services;
  * to assess your general health and well-being needs and to continue to meet those needs; and
  * to provide you with online and mobile member services.



We may use your personal information for a secondary purpose. A secondary purpose is a purpose other than the original purpose for which we collected your personal information. For instance, if you provide us with information to obtain a health insurance policy, we may use your personal information to provide you with information regarding other health services such as eyecare and dental services.

We only use your sensitive information for a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose for which we collected your personal information.

We develop programs and initiatives from time to time to assist THF members with day to day health and wellbeing issues such as diet and exercise, as well as assistance with illnesses suffered by members.

You may choose to sign up to such programs from time to time. You are not obliged to join any such programs. If you do join any such programs, we may use personal information already collected from you so that you can get the most benefit from such programs. For instance, if you suffer from diabetes and choose to join a program that assists with your diabetes treatment, we may use earlier personal information collected from you in order to advise on your treatment program.

We may also use your contact details to send you information about us or our products, services or programs. If you do not wish us to send you this information, please tell us when we collect the personal information from you.

## Disclosure of your personal information

We do not sell your personal information to any third party. We will not disclose any personal information about you, except:

  * to our related companies, joint venture and business partners such as dental or eye care providers;
  * to our suppliers, third party service providers or subcontractors (as necessary to enable them to help provide our services and any member programs to you);
  * to hospitals, healthcare providers, Medicare or other government agencies or financial institutions;
  * as required by law; or
  * with your consent.



Some of our programs that you may join may be administered by third parties in order to provide the best service to you. To ensure the efficient administration of such programs, we may need to disclose your personal information to these third parties.

The third party program administrators cannot disclose your personal information to any third parties.

If you join programs through us which are administered by third parties, you may need to disclose personal information to these third parties. The third parties do not disclose this information to us. Your disclosure of personal information directly to such third parties would be subject to their privacy policies.

If the THF membership policy covers you as a main contributor and a partner or children, please note that we will contact the main policy holder regarding anyone else covered on the policy. Everyone on a group policy such as for families or partners should be made aware of this.

We regularly need to disclose your sensitive information such as health records to third parties such as hospitals, doctors or other health specialists. We will not disclose such information without your verbal or written consent as relevant in the situation. In some circumstances, we may require your written consent to disclose sensitive information such as your prescriptions to third parties.

If we disclose your personal information to any person in connection with our provision of services to you, we will ensure that we do everything reasonably within our power to prevent unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information.

## Transfer of your personal information overseas

We will not transfer your personal information overseas unless:

  * you consent to the transfer; or
  * the transfer is necessary for the performance of our services to you; or
  * the transfer is for your benefit, it is impracticable to obtain your consent and if it were practicable, you would be likely to give your consent; or
  * the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest between us and an overseas third party.



## Accuracy of your personal information

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information we collect or use is accurate, complete, up to date and stored in a secure environment and is accessed only by authorised personnel for permitted purposes. Please contact us if you need to update your information.

## Security of your personal information

We will take reasonable steps to protect all personal information we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

We have ensured that appropriate technical and organisational security measures, consistent with standard industry practice, are in place to attempt to safeguard the security and confidentiality of the personal information we collect. Because of the nature of the internet, however, we cannot guarantee that our website or our online and mobile member services are totally protected from hackers or misuse and we will not be responsible for any breach of security caused by third parties. We do not use any form of encryption (encoding software) to protect information you send from your computer to us over the internet through the use of feedback, enquiries and appointment forms and emails. Encryption software is applied when using online or mobile member services and joining online.

We will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed for any purpose for which the personal information may be used or disclosed under this Privacy Policy.

## Access to and correction of your personal information

If you wish to access or correct any personal information which we hold about you, or request its removal from our records, please contact our Privacy Officer whose details are below.

If you require access to your eye care records, eye test results or dental records, please contact your eye care or dental care provider directly and not the Privacy Officer.

We will respond to your access request as soon as practicable and, in any case, within 30 days. We will either respond by providing you with the access or amendments you have requested, or by providing you with our reasons for refusing to do so.

If we refuse to amend your health information, you may request that we attach to the health information a statement of the amendment sought, and we must take reasonable steps to do so.

In some circumstances, we may need to charge a fee to cover administrative costs in respect of retrieving your personal information and providing it to you. We will inform you if there are going to be any such costs involved in retrieving your personal information.

## Contacting us anonymously

You may contact THF anonymously. If you choose to do so, however, we will be limited in the products or services we are able to assist you with.
