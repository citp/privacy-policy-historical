4\. We use safe protocols for communication and transferring data (such as HTTPS).

5\. TeachThought contracts expertise in cybersecurity that regularly reviews our safety protocol, identifies vulnerabilities and makes any necessary changes/improvements to reduce threats to your data, our data as a company, and our shared experience as education professionals trying to work together in a sometimes dangerous social/digital/internet context.
