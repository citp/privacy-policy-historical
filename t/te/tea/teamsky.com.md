## 6\. Do we send any of your data outside the EEA?

The European Economic Area or "EEA" is deemed to have good standards when it comes to data privacy. As such, we consciously limit the occasions when we may need to transfer or handle your data outside of the EEA. Where we do, for example where our service providers (including Shopify inc.) are based outside of the EEA, we make sure that your data is still treated fairly and lawfully in all respects (including making sure we have a legal ground for sending your data outside the EEA and putting in place all necessary safeguards for such arrangement).

Where relevant, you will have the right to see a copy of any safeguards we put in place for international transfers of your data. Just get in touch with us if you would like to find out more.

## 7\. How Long Do We Keep Your Data For?

We will retain your personal data only for as long as is strictly necessary for the purposes for which such data was originally collected (or for such longer period as may be required by law). In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 8\. Links

Our website may contain links to other websites over which we have no control. We are not responsible for privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from this site. Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this privacy/cookies notice or our website's Terms and Conditions. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of those other websites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.

## 9\. Security

We have implemented reasonable technical and organisational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure.We also make sure that third parties who need to handle your data when helping us to deliver our services are subject to suitable confidentiality and security standards.

Any data you provide to us via the Online Store is stored through Shopify's data storage, databases and the general Shopify application on a secure server behind a firewall.

If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.

Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards. However, the internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes and consequently such transmission is at your own risk.

## 10\. Your rights

In certain situations, you are entitled to:

  * access a copy of your personal data;
  * correct or update your personal data, which you can do yourself in relation to the Online Store by logging into your account or by contacting us at the address in this privacy/cookies notice;
  * erase your personal data;
  * object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (as set out in the above table);
  * restrict the processing of your personal data;
  * request the transfer of your personal data to a third party; or
  * where you have provided your consent to certain of our processing activities you may withdraw your consent at any time (but please note that we may continue to process such personal data if we have legitimate legal grounds for doing so).



If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact Us. The good news is that you don't have to pay a fee to exercise your rights, unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive (in which case we can charge a reasonable fee). Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. Where your request is legitimate, we will always respond within one month (unless there is a legal reason to take longer, such as where your request is particularly complex). We may also need you to confirm your identity before we proceed with your request if it is not clear to us who is making the request.

In addition to the above, you may get in touch with the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) if you are concerned about the way in which we are handling your personal data. However, where possible, we would really appreciate you speaking with us first if you have any concerns.
