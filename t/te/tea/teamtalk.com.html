      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TEAMtalk Media Limited
      ("TEAMtalk") does not collect personally identifiable information about
      individuals except when such individuals specifically provide such information
      on a voluntary basis. For example, such personally identifiable information
      may be gathered from competitions, community postings (e.g. "Your Say" areas),
      suggestions and transactional areas. Personally identifiable information
      on individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated
      third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection.
      At such points of collection, the user will have the opportunity to indicate
      whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving promotional and/or
      marketing information about other products, services and offerings from
      TEAMtalk and/or any third parties. Further, notwithstanding any opt out
      of promotional information by the user, TEAMtalk reserves the right to contact
      a subscriber regarding account status, changes to the service agreement
      and other matters relevant to the underlying service and/or the information
      collected.
      </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> TEAMtalk may perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics
        in order to measure interest in the use of the various areas of the site
        and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of
        users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners.
        TEAMtalk will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third
        parties. Also, users should be aware that TEAMtalk may sometimes permit
        third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services
        through a TEAMtalk site. TEAMtalk is not responsible for any actions or
        policies of such third parties and users should check the applicable privacy
        policy of such party when providing personally identifiable information.
      </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Additionally, users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose
        personally identifiable information (e.g. user name, e-mail address) on
        the bulletin boards or in the chat areas of the TEAMtalk sites, that information,
        along with any substantive information disclosed in the user's communication,
        can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result
        in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities
        are beyond the control of TEAMtalk.
      </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may
        be automatically collected through the standard operation of TEAMtalk's
        internet servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small
        text files a web site can use to recognise repeat users, facilitate the
        user's ongoing access to and use of the site, track usage, follow site
        behaviour and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements
        and targeted advertising. Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's
        system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique
        number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Users
        should be aware that TEAMtalk cannot control the use of cookies or the
        resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for
        TEAMtalk. If a user does not want information collected through the use
        of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the
        user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note
        that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features
        (e.g. customised delivery of information) available on the TEAMtalk.com
        web site.
      </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Upon request, TEAMtalk will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional
        contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, TEAMtalk will use reasonable
        efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously
        submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities
        will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's
        request, TEAMtalk will use commercially reasonable efforts functionally
        to delete the user and his or her personal information from its database;
        however, it may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual
        information because of backups and records of deletions.
