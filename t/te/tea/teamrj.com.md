We work with many publishers and their agents to provide you with access to the content available on this Site. Accordingly, certain items and content on the Site are delivered to you by companies other than John Cottrell & Ress Benson. This includes property and community information. In the cases where you purchase an item on our Site that is fulfilled by another company, you become a customer of the publisher or seller of that item, and we will provide certain of your personal information to that third party. We typically provide personal information such as the item purchased, the price you paid, your name, your email address and your mailing address. We may also ask you to provide us with certain marketing or demographic information at the time of your purchase.

**5\. Security and Passwords**  
The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. John Cottrell & Ress Benson intends to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect such information from unauthorized access or disclosure. While we make efforts to ensure that your information is secure on our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

When your password is requested on this Site, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to present secure pages to protect that information. You can tell if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your browser window. In Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see a lock icon. When the symbol is unbroken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you use. You can download the latest version from the Netscape or Microsoft web sites. Using beta versions of browsers is not recommended.

You can change your password at any time, and you can set a new password in case you forgot your old one which is accessible from our home page. Please keep your password in a safe place and do not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is especially important if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe.

Your account is protected by your password. You choose a password when you first start an account with us. Your password needs to:   
\- be at least 5 characters long (case sensitive)  
\- include both numbers and letters  
\- not contain symbols (*, $, #, %, etc.)  
Make sure to select a password that is not obvious. A good password includes seemingly random letters and numbers, for example, F3M8N1.

**6\. Emails Sent to You**  
We will send you emails relating to certain activities including when you request property information. We may send you email notices about new features, products and services. We may also send you email notices regarding Site and service announcements containing important information about the Services. You can unsubscribe to these notifications by following the 'unsubscribe' instructions at the bottom of the email you receive. 

**7\. Cookies**

John Cottrell & Ress Benson uses cookies to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies permit John Cottrell & Ress Benson to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information.
