**Privacy Policy**  
TeamXbox is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal information you provide online. 

**WebTrendsLive**  
WebTrends Live is used to analyze traffic to this web site. WebTrends Live does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services WebTrends Live does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. WebTrends Live only collects aggregate data. For more information about WebTrends Live privacy policy, please click [here](http://www.webtrendslive.com/wtl_marcom/privacy_policy.htm). 

**Basic Confidentiality Policy**  
It is policy that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number, is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you may provide us, such as through our forum, chat or by email used only for the purposes for which you provide the information. For example, if you choose to give your name and/or any other personal information it is completely by your own will. 

TeamXbox will not solicit or provide any private information to outside vendors or organizations. Information you choose to submit on our site is for public view and at your discretion. Therefore any information you submit publicly on teamxbox.com by way of forums or chats can be viewed by outside sources. Any emails submitted to any member of TeamXbox will remain privately held and no such information will be made public unless user permission is granted. 

**No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information**  
Our server is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites. This information is used only for internal purposes by TeamXbox technical support staff. 

In addition, our website tracks information about the visits to our website. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information. 

TeamXbox is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of any affiliates or 3rd party organizations displayed within our website.
