TED is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world. While gathering information about the people who use the TED site, our apps, platforms and related sites (collectively referred to as “TED”), we take your privacy very seriously, and make every effort to safeguard your personal data. This privacy policy is intended to inform you of what information we collect, how this information is used and what steps we take to protect this information.

## What information we collect 

We collect three kinds of information: 

  1. Personal information that you directly provide to us, which includes information you supply when you register an account with us and save items to your profile.
  2. Non-personal information that's automatically gathered as you use TED.com, which includes tracking information for our site.
  3. Cookies, to help us understand what areas of the site are most useful and interesting to our audience.

###### We collect some information to help customize your experience based on your previous activities on TED.com.

### Information you provide directly to us 

##### Account information

When you register an account with us, we ask for basic information such as email, name and password, and give you the option to provide other information. If you create an account through another user profile (such as Facebook, or other social media) then they will send us your information from your profile to use in accordance with our privacy policy. At times, you may be asked to provide additional information, such as payment for conference registration. We also collect activities you generate by favoriting, saving or watching talks.

* * *

###### We collect basic information you provide when you create a TED.com account or register for a conference. It's secure, and we'll never sell it.

* * *

##### Billing and credit card information

When required for TED Conference registration or other services, we may store your name, address, telephone number and email address. We do not store credit card numbers except for the last 4 digits. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction.

* * *

###### We need payment info to complete purchases, but we don't store sensitive information.

##### Comments and other public activities

We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on TED.com. "Public activities" are any actions you take that are designed to be visible to other users -- including comments, recommendations and ratings. If you choose to engage in public activities, any personal information you submit there can be read, collected or used by other users of these areas. Your account is public by default. Please refer to the [Community Guidelines](https://web.archive.org/about/our-organization/our-policies-terms/community-guidelines) about how to best take advantage of our interactive spaces.

We are not responsible for personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. Information shared here could be used by others, potentially to send you unsolicited messages. If the information posted publicly is not consistent with our terms of use, your content may be removed. For more information, see the [TED.com Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/about/our-organization/our-policies-terms/ted-com-terms-of-use).

###### Any personal information you post publicly is visible to all users. Be mindful of what you share, as we are not responsible for what happens with this information.

* * *

### Non-personal information collected automatically 

##### Tracking information for our site

This type of information relates to how many views are associated with each TED Talk, how many times talks are saved or favorited, and/or other areas of the site that automatically store non-personal information about the sites’ usage, popularity or positive or negative impact. We perform statistical analyses of users of the site, and their viewing and participation patterns, for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our audience.

* * *

###### We keep track of how often our audience engages with TED and do not share contact information with our advertisers.

* * *

##### Device information

We may collect non-personal information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access TED services, such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.

* * *

###### We use non-personal information to help us understand how our audience views TED.
