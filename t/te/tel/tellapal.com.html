	<p>This privacy policy describes how Extole, Inc. (“Extole”) collects and uses the personal information you provide on our Web sites: <a href="http://www.extole.com">www.extole.com</a> and <a href="http://www.tellapal.com/">www.tellapal.com</a>, as well as the data collected at the Extole applications and wherever this privacy policy is posted. Please note that for data collected through Extole applications, Extole is acting as a data processor and service provider and collecting the data on behalf of our business clients (“Clients”).  Extole collects information under the direction of its Clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. Extole works with its Clients to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal information is collected.</p>
	<p>Extole complies with the U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S.–Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

	<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
	<p>Except as described below, Extole does not collect or require users of its service, http://www.extole.com/, to furnish personal information. Like most websites, Extole collects non-personal information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring/exit pages, and the date and time of each visitor request, browser type, and operating system. Extole’s purpose in collecting non-personal information is to better understand how Extole’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Extole may release non-personal information in the aggregate, for example, by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its service.</p>
	<p>Extole also collects potentially personal information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Extole does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personal information, as described below.</p>

	<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
	<p>We collect the following personal information from you when you visit our website:</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>Contact Information such as name, email address, phone number</li>
		<li>Information about your business such as company name</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As is true of most websites, we automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. We use this information to</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>Send you requested product or service information</li>
		<li>Enable you to post your resume, search job postings, and contact or be contacted by prospective employers</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition Extole provides the technology to promote referral-marketing campaigns for our clients. Extole enables certain users to participate in or promote referral-marketing campaigns for advertisers on the Extole network. Those users who would like to participate in an Extole campaign require Extole to know a little bit more about them, i.e., personal information. To participate in an Extole campaign, users must provide certain personal information, such as their name and email address. Extole does not disclose personal information other than as described below. And users can always refuse to supply personal information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities (i.e. participating in an Extole campaign). </p>
	<p>Extole also has functionality where we may collect some of your personal information through the Facebook Connect and the Graph API. Your data will be shared with us from Facebook. We use Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider to authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form and to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.</p>
	<p>For our Facebook applications we also use Facebook Permissions in order to give you the option to share personal information like your activities and interests as well as the authorization to post information about your activity to your profile page.  All personal information that may be collected is done so via an iframe or through a Facebook application on behalf of our client. Please refer to the privacy policy on the site/iframe where this data is collected.</p>
	<p>Extole will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed provide services to our Client. Extole will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

	<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
	<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.  We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities:  </p>
	<ul>
		<li>hosting company</li>
		<li>CRM</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These companies are authorized to use your personal information <em>only as necessary to provide</em> these services to us. We may also disclose your personal information</p>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process</li>
		<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request,</li>
		<li>if Extole is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,</li>
		<li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.</li>
	</ul>
<p></p>
	<h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
	<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies both on our corporate website and our client sites. We do link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our website.  Third parties also use cookies and other tracking technologies such as scripts on our site.  The data is only collected in the aggregate. The use of cookies by our affiliates is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our service providers use session ID cookies in order to track usage and enable us to improve the navigability of our services over time.</p>
	<p>Extole and certain advertiser partners on the Extole network may use cookies to help Extole identify and track visitors, their usage of Extole service to participate in Extole campaigns, and their website access preferences.

Extole visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before linking to Extole’s website, with the drawback that certain features of Extole’s website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
	<h2>Communications from us</h2>
	<p>If you register for any of the Extole programs and applications, you may receive promotional communications on behalf of our client. You can opt out of these by unsubscribing through the unsubscribe link in the email.</p>

	<h2>Updating of Personal information, and Opt-Out</h2>
