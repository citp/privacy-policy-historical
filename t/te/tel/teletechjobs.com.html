				<h2>What personal data do we collect?</h2>
				<p>Personal data is information that identifies you as an individual.  TeleTech collects certain types of personal data at <a href="http://www.teletech.com">http://www.teletech.com</a> (our "website") and offline in connection with the services we provide. </p>
				<p>We collect personal data from you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number or other payment account number, only when you voluntarily provide it to us.  In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided by us (for example, to subscribe to our newsletter, request information from us), we may require that you furnish personal data.</p>

				<h2>Your privacy on TeleTech’s websites</h2>
				<p>The primary purpose of TeleTech’s website is to be a dynamic resource and business tool to help you learn more about TeleTech. We want you to feel secure when visiting our website and are committed to maintaining your privacy when doing so.</p>

				<h2>What information do we gather?</h2>
				<p>TeleTech collects information at its website in two ways: (1) directly (for example, when you provide information to sign up for a newsletter or register to comment on a forum website); and (2) indirectly (for example, through our website's technology).</p>
				<p> We may collect and process the following information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Information that you provide by filling in forms on our website. This includes subscribing to services, newsletters and alerts. Pages that collect this type of information may provide further information as to why your data is needed and how it will be used. It is completely up to you whether you want to provide it.</li>
					<li>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
					<li>We may ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them.</li>
					<li>Any postings, comments or other content that you upload or post to TeleTech’s website.</li>
					<li>Our website collects information about your computer, including (where available) your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration, to filter traffic, to look up user domains and to report on statistics.</li>
					<li>Details of your visits to our website, the pages you view and resources you access or download, including but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data. Please see the Cookies section below for more information.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>When this information relates to or identifies you, we will treat it as “personal data.”</p>

				<h2>How do we use information that we collect from the site?</h2>
				<p>We use personal data to provide you with information you request, process online job applications, and for other purposes which we would describe to you at the point where it is collected or which will be obvious to you. For example:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To fulfill your requests articles, newsletters or other content. </li>
					<li>For surveys or research questionnaires. </li> 
					<li>To personalize your experience at our website.</li>
					<li>To contact you for marketing purposes where you have agreed to this. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>We analyze your IP and browser information to determine what is most effective about our website, to help us identify ways to improve it and make it more effective. </p>

				<h2>What about "Cookies"?</h2>
				<p>The term "cookie" refers to files that are transferred from a website to your computer's hard drive. The purpose of cookies is to enable us to track your activities on our website. Cookies help us remember who you are. They work in the same fashion as the clerk in a store you visit on a regular basis. The store clerk may not necessarily know your name, but he or she recognizes that you have been in the store before and may remember what you usually purchase while you are in the store. Cookies permit us to gain the same kind of information about you and enable us to provide you with more efficient and personalized service. For example, for sites that require registration, a cookie file can be stored on your computer enabling you to skip the registration process on subsequent visits. Cookies are also frequently used to track the progression of a customer engaged in an online purchase to make sure that the transactional information remains intact.</p>
				<p>Some (usually newer) versions of Web browsers allow you to decide whether or not to accept cookie files and some programs notify you when a website is about to deposit a cookie file on your hard drive. If you decide not to accept cookies, you may not be able to successfully navigate some portions of a website.</p>
				<p>TeleTech uses cookie files for the customized presentation of Web pages. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in the cookie, nor do we use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, except as expressly set forth in this privacy statement.</p>

				<h2>Will we share your personal data with outside parties?</h2>
				<p>TeleTech may store, use, and disclose personal information as authorized or required by applicable law, including making disclosures that are necessary or advisable to: (1) protect the rights, health, safety, or property of TeleTech or others; (2) to perform analysis that we may use to improve our website or services; (3) allow for lawful security related investigations or law enforcement investigations; and (4) comply with applicable laws, regulations, or other lawful requirements.</p>
				<p>Except as stated above, TeleTech will not transfer, exchange, license, sell, lease, or otherwise disclose your personal information without your approval; however, TeleTech may collect and/or provide aggregate statistics about TeleTech’s website and website visitors to other parties. We will not sell personal data to third parties. We may transfer personal data to our contracted service providers and advisors who may be located in other countries. Before we do so, we take steps to confirm that your personal data will be given adequate protection as required by relevant data protection laws and TeleTech’s internal policies.</p>

				<h2>What about sensitive personal data?</h2>
				<p>We do not generally seek to collect sensitive personal data through this site. In the limited cases where we do seek to collect such data, we will do this in accordance with local data privacy law requirements. If you choose to provide us with unsolicited sensitive personal data, you consent to our using the data, subject to applicable law as described in this privacy statement. The term "sensitive personal data" refers to the various categories of personal data identified by European and other data privacy laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent. These categories may include personal identity numbers, financial account information, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, philosophical or other similar beliefs, membership of a trade union or profession or trade association, physical or mental health, biometric or genetic data, sexual life, or criminal record (including information about suspected criminal activities). Sensitive personal data may be collected and used in the context of your employment application and relationship with TeleTech, to provide you with services you request, or to perform analysis that we may use to improve our website or services and may be shared with our service providers for these purposes. </p>

				<h2>What about data security?</h2>
				<p>We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of personal data collected via TeleTech’s websites. You should understand that the open nature of the Internet is such that information and personal data may flow over networks connecting you to our systems without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended.</p>
				<p>Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the sites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these sites, please note that these sites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or sites. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these sites.</p>

				<h2>Where will your personal data be processed?</h2>
				<p>As a global organization with global IT systems, personal data we collect may be routed, stored, or transferred internationally throughout TeleTech's worldwide organization. We have internal policies in place to provide an equivalent level of protection is in place across our organization.</p>

				<h2>Retention of your data</h2>
				<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as needed to provide services to you and as further needed for us to comply with our global legal and contractual obligations.</p>

				<h2>Your rights</h2>
				<p>You are entitled to know whether we hold personal data about you and, if we do, to have access to that personal data and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate. In some circumstances, you may have the right to oppose the use of your data or have your data deleted. You can do this by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@teletech.com">privacy@teletech.com</a>.</p>

Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all such data.   If there is any conflict between the language in this privacy statement, the Principles will govern. </p>
