# Privacy policy - Worcester Telegram & Gazette - telegram.com

_This Privacy Policy was last updated January 1, 2011_

This policy describes how the web sites maintained by the Telegram & Gazette ("we" or "T&G") and all others controlled by us (the "Site") - collect and utilize users' personally identifiable information ("PII"). The T&G Sites are general audience web sites, and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age. 

By using the Site, you signify your agreement with all the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site. 

From time to time T&G may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our Site or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, T &G will post those changes in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of such Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after T & G posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. 

**Information we don't gather**

Users can access our web sites and use many of our services without providing any personal information. We don't follow a user's browsing path outside our web sites. 

We do develop summary reports of usage for our advertisers. This includes the numbers of times pages are viewed. This information is used to determine the effectiveness of advertising strategies. We don't tell our advertisers the identity of individual users who saw or clicked on their advertisements. 

**Information we do gather**

Certain services require registration which may ask for a user's identity. 

We will not sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your e-mail address without your permission. This also applies to any information that personally identifies you, except as noted below. We do, however, share information about our audience in aggregate form. For example, we may want to know how long the average reader spends on the Site, or which pages or features get the most attention. 

We have contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of our visitors and customers. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of our Web sites is owned and used by us alone. We use this information to help provide our advertisers with more targeted advertising opportunities, which means that users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. 

**Usage tracking**

We track usage patterns on our web sites, breaking down overall statistics according to a user's browser type, domain name and time of day. We do not match these statistics with a user's personal identifiable information. This information, for example, helps to determine if a majority of our users are employing a recent enough browser version to support certain forms of coding. 

**"Email this story to a friend"**

The e-mail addresses that you supply to this service are saved for your convenience for future articles you may wish to e-mail; these addresses are not used for any other purpose, and will not be shared with any third parties. 

**Contests**

T&G Online often offers contests in which participants must register. Required information always includes at least name and email address. Sometimes more information is required. The rules and terms of each contest can vary. Contests are often run in partnership with advertisers or businesses and registration information may be shared with those parties. 

**Subscribing to the paper, buying a photo and/or placing a classified ad**

Personal information is required to complete any of these transactions. The information is maintained in databases offline by the individual departments. 

**With whom do we share the information we gather?**

We contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including credit-card and billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing and analytics or promotions management. We provide these companies only with the information they need to perform their services. These service providers are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for T&G, and they may not share or resell this data. 

We reserve the right to disclose your opt-out information to third parties so they can suppress your name from future solicitations, in accordance with applicable laws. We may occasionally release personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena. (For more information, see the "Compliance with legal process" section of this policy.) 

**Compliance with legal process**

We may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web sites; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).
