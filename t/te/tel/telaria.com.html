<h4><strong>This privacy policy describes how Telaria, Inc. and its affiliates (Telaria, we, us, or our) collects, uses, and shares information through both its video advertising services, including our video management platform, as well as the Telaria website, Telaria.com, and other Telaria digital properties and products that link to this privacy policy (Telaria Site or Site).&nbsp;For information regarding Outstream Services, please visit <a href="https://outstream.telaria.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong></h4>
<h3><strong>A. Telaria </strong><strong>Video management platform </strong></h3>
<p>Telaria operates a self-service software platform that helps our publisher clients (i.e., content owners or other sellers of video advertising inventory, including websites and apps) analyze, manage and monetize their video advertising inventory on internet connected devices and platforms, including mobile devices, computers and connected TVs. This section of our privacy policy explains how our platform collects, receives, uses, and shares information in providing services to our clients.</p>
<h5><strong>Information we</strong><strong> collect </strong><strong>or receive</strong></h5>
<p>We work with publishers as instructed by them to analyze, manage and monetize their video advertising inventory.&nbsp; This video advertising inventory is made available to advertisers, agencies and other media buying platforms, which we collectively refer to as advertisers.&nbsp; When an advertiser successfully purchases and serves an advertisement to a publisher’s advertising inventory, the video advertisement will be displayed to you in connection with the content that you view.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we receive certain information from the websites and apps where videos are displayed, pass that information to advertisers, and vice-versa. The information we receive may include IP address, location-related data, mobile application data, the web page URL or app in which an individual is viewing a video, video player size, the video title, description, or category being displayed, the date and time of video display, browser or device type, a cookie or device identifier, and other data which the publisher chooses to provide to us.</p>
<p>We may also receive information from third parties at the instruction or for the benefit of our clients, in particular data management platforms and services (either through a publisher or through a relationship that we have directly established) that provide user demographics and information with respect to a users’ preferences, patterns, click and video interactions, behaviors or interests, as well as advertisers and advertising platforms that provide information to us in order to match an ad opportunity offered by our clients with the right advertisement.</p>
<p>Once we deliver that advertisement, we may receive information about how you interact with that advertisement, such as how long you view it and whether you click through to visit the advertiser.</p>
<h5><strong>How Telaria uses information</strong></h5>
<p>We and our service providers use information for legitimate business purposes including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing the functionality of our video management platform and fulfilling requests
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>For trending and statistics, and to develop, market and/or improve our products and services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will engage in these activities where we have a legitimate interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregating and/or anonymizing
<ul>
<li>We may aggregate and/or anonymize information so that it will no longer relate to an identified or identifiable individual. We do so to generate other data for our use, which we may use and disclose for any purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will engage in these activities where we have a legitimate interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accomplishing our business purposes
<ul>
<li>For audits, to verify that our internal processes function as intended and are compliant with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements.</li>
<li>For fraud and security monitoring purposes, for example, to detect and prevent cyberattacks or attempts to commit identity theft.</li>
<li>To prepare or execute a business transaction, such as a corporate restructuring, merger or acquisition.</li>
<li>To protect our rights and to defend against lawsuits.</li>
<li>To respond to legal duties, such as requests from public and government authorities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Children</strong></h5>
<p>The Telaria video management platform is directed to, and intended for use by, adults only. We do not knowingly direct our activities to children under the age of sixteen.</p>
<h5><strong>Advertising </strong><strong>technologies and other information</strong></h5>
<p>In order to perform the video management platform, Telaria uses cookies, device identifiers, and other similar technologies. A cookie is a small piece of text data that is stored by your browser. Cookies are commonly assigned by online services, such as websites or ad technologies, to recognize a computer or device that they have encountered before. A device identifier is an alphanumeric identifier generated by the operating system for use in advertising purposes, and it functions in a manner similar to cookies in web browsers. Other technologies that relate to cookies include pixel tags, which are small blocks of code that allow websites to read and place cookies. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>In relation to our video management platform, Telaria may use cookies for the benefit of its publisher clients and advertisers in order for them to match an ad opportunity with the right advertisement. To do so, Telaria performs a cookie syncing between the client’s cookies, a cookie Telaria uses for its client’s benefit and the advertiser’s cookies. Telaria also uses a cookie for frequency capping, i.e., to ensure that the same user is not served the same advertisement repeatedly.</p>
<p>As your primary touchpoint, publishers (i.e., the website or application on which you are viewing content) should generally provide mechanisms to ensure, where applicable, that you consent to the cookies and similar technologies set out above. In addition, there are various ways in which you may signal your choices regarding such cookies and similar technologies, including as follows:</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Location</strong> – You may be able to limit our collection and use of precise location data by using your mobile device’s location services settings. These settings may vary from device to device.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising Identifiers – </strong>You may also be able to use the settings offered by your mobile or other Internet connected device to limit the collection of data from that device for advertising purposes. To use those settings, you should check your device’s settings menu. Note that if you use those choice settings, some data may still be collected from your device for various other purposes, and you may still see advertising on that device based on other factors. For more information regarding device settings, you can visit our device opt-out guide <a href="https://telaria.com/device-opt-out-guide/">here</a>.</li>

<p><strong>Personal information </strong>– To the extent information that we collect, receive or use relates to an identified or identifiable individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we will treat such information as personal information as required by applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Your rights </strong>– If you would like to request to review, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete personal information that you have previously provided to us, object to the processing of personal information, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@telaria.com">privacy@telaria.com</a>.&nbsp; Please note that in relation to our video management platform, your primary touchpoint is the publisher.
