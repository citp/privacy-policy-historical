			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p></p>

			
			<h3>This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 12, 2010</h3>
				<p></p>
				
				<p>TellApart Inc. ("TellApart") provides e-commerce sites and advertisers ("Business Partners") access to a set of technologies and
				processes designed to display advertisements to consumers viewing a publisher's website(s) (the "TellApart Ads").</p>
				
				<p>This Privacy Policy describes TellApart's privacy practices as
				they pertain to (i) visitors to our website located at www.TellApart.com (our
				"Site"), and (ii) our targeted advertising technology service
				("Technology").</p>
				
				<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please
				feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@TellApart.com">info@TellApart.com</a>.</p>
				

				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
			
				<p><b>1. Site Privacy Policy</b></p>
				
				<p>The Site is intended primarily to offer information about
				TellApart and the services we provide. </p>
				
				<p><u>Information Collected via the Site</u></p>
				
				<p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") from
				the Site when you choose to provide it to us. PII is any information that can
				be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but
				is not limited to: name, postal address, telephone number, or email address.
				For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by
				completing an online form on this Site. We use this information only to contact
				you to respond to your inquiry. Once collected, we will store your PII for a
				reasonable time for record keeping purposes. The information that we store is
				usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.</p>
				
				<p>We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information
				(Non-PII) via the Site. Non-PII cannot be used to contact any single person or
				entity and may include your IP address, pages viewed on this Site, browser
				type, Internet Service Provider, the time/date of your visit to this Site, and
				your computer's operating system (e.g., Windows XP). TellApart uses this information
				for internal purposes such as to administer the Site, improve and customize the
				Site, help TellApart understand and analyze how the Site is being used and to track
				aggregate Site usage.</p>

				
				<p><u>Cookies and Web Beacons</u></p>
				
				<p>We use "cookies" and web beacons to help us manage this Site.
				Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. We
				also use persistent cookies on this Site in order to help us manage the opt-out
				process for our Technology. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for
				an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following
				directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Web beacons (also
				known as "1X1 pixels" or "clear GIFs") are small strings of code that provide a
				method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for
				the purpose of transferring data. For more information about cookies and web
				beacons please visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/</a>.</p>
				
				<p><u>Third Party Websites</u></p>
				
				<p>The Site may contain links to other websites. Such websites
				may use cookies and/or other data collection tools. TellApart is not responsible for
				the privacy practices, policies or content of such other websites. TellApart
				encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies whenever interacting
				with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website.
				TellApart has no control over the use of information by third party websites, and
				you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any PII to those
				websites.</p>
				
				<p><u>Updating / Deleting your PII</u></p>

				
				<p>If you'd like us to update, correct, delete, or deactivate any
				PII that you have provided to us on this Site, please send your request to us
				at <a href="mailto:info@TellApart.com">info@TellApart.com</a> and we will process your request within a reasonable period
				of time after receipt.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><b>2. Information Collection and Use</b></p>
			

				<p><u>Overview of TellApart's Technology</u></p>
				
				<p>Our Technology collects information about the website(s)
				that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online. You may
				encounter our Technology: when TellApart or one of our Business Partners purchase online
				advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when one of our Business Partners
				places one of our web beacons on its website, which you visit.</p>
				
				<p>We use the information collected by our Technology in order
				to help make the TellApart Ads you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and
				reporting purposes.</p>
			

				
				<p><u>Cookies and Web Beacons</u></p>
				
				<p>TellApart uses cookies and web beacons in connection with our
				Technology. Cookies help TellApart better understand the effectiveness of a TellApart Ad
				(for example, by tracking the way in which you may respond to, selectand
				interact with a TellApart Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and
				context in which you view a TellApart Ad). TellApart's cookies also help control the
				number of times you view a TellApart Ad. Most Internet browsers automatically accept
				cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop
				accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you
				visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to enjoy the
				full functionality of many of the websites you visit.</p>
				
				<p>TellApart also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to
				analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows TellApart to record that
				someone has visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that
				the website may choose to include with the beacon.</p>
				
				<p><u>Third Party Links and Websites</u></p>
				
				<p>TellApart Ads may contain links to other websites, including
				those of our Business Partners. Such websites may use cookies and/or other data
				collection tools. TellApart is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies
				or the content of such websites. TellApart encourages everyone to read the posted
				privacy policies whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the
				privacy practices of that website. TellApart has no control over the use of
				anyinformation by third party websites, and you should exercise caution when
				deciding to disclose any PII. Similarly, TellApart does not have access to, or
				control of, the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed
				on any advertisement by a third-party, including those of our Business Partners, and
				this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection
				tools by any third party.</p>
				
				<p><u>Information Relating to Children</u></p>

				
				<p>Our products and services are designed for those 13 years of age and older. 
				We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13. If we are made aware that 
				we have received PII from someone under 13, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that 
				information from our records.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<a name="3"></a>
				<p><b>3. Information Security</b></p>
				
				
				<p><u>Information Security</u></p>
				
				<p>The security of your information is important to us. We have
				implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our
				care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is
				not limited to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the
				Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore,
				while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
				information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
				
				<p>If you have any questions about our security practices,
				please send an email to us at <a href="mailto:info@TellApart.com">info@TellApart.com</a>.</p>

				<p><u>Opting out</u></p>
				
				<p>If you'd like to opt-out from having TellApart collect your
				Non-PII in connection with our Technology, please 
				<a href="http://t.tellapart.com/btexclude">click here to opt out</a>.
				When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out
				cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor TellApart Ads to your
				interests. Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies,
				or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew
				your opt-out choice.</p>
				
				<p><u>Deleting your PII</u></p>
