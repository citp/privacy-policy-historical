|  | TeleSign's Privacy Policy  
---  
Your right to privacy is very important to us. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you with better service. We do not sell or rent the information you provide to us online to third parties.  
Collection of Personal Information  
When you visit our Web site and access information you remain anonymous. However, when you engage in certain activities on this site, such as requesting product information, downloading software, or use our live demo, TeleSign may ask you to provide certain information about yourself such as your name, phone number, mailing address, email address, and other personal identifying information.  
When you submit personal information to TeleSign, you understand and agree that TeleSign and its subsidiaries, affiliates and trusted vendors may transfer, store, and process your customer profile in any of the countries in which TeleSign and its affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States.  
TeleSign collects this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. TeleSign also uses information that you provide as part of our effort to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other TeleSign products and services.  
Protecting Your Privacy  
We will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. For example, access to personally identifiable information is limited to individuals needing such access to perform their job function.  
Your Feedback  
If you wish to remove your personal information from our marketing files, modify your personal information or comment on our privacy policy, please send an email to [info@telesign.com](mailto:info@telesign.com).  
TeleSign welcomes comments and questions on this policy. We are dedicated to protecting your personal information and will make every reasonable effort to keep that information secure. Due to the rapidly evolving technologies on the Internet, we may occasionally update this policy. All revisions will be posted to this site.
