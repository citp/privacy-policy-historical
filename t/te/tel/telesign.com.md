The security of your Personal Data and our Customers’ information is important to us. We maintain a comprehensive information security program designed to ensure the security of your Personal Data by implementing physical, technical, and administrative measures and safeguards.

We follow best practices and generally accepted standards to store and protect the Personal Data we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate. For Personal Data collected or received over unsecure Internet channels, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS).

Our Security Team regularly reviews our security and privacy practices and enhances them as necessary to help sure the integrity of our systems and your Personal Data. Nonetheless, security vulnerabilities are continually evolving which means that no security measures can guarantee absolute security, but we will use reasonable efforts to prevent the accidental or unlawful loss, misuse or alteration of your Personal Data.

We review our data retention periods for Personal Data on a regular basis. We are legally required to hold some types of information to fulfill our statutory obligations. We will hold your Personal Data in our systems for as long as is necessary to provide the Services you have requested, and thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal or business purposes. These might include retention periods:

  * mandated by law, contract or similar obligations application to our business operations;
  * for preserving, resolving (customer support), defending or enforcing our legal/contractual rights; or
  * needed to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records (billing purposes).



We take steps to destroy or permanently de-identify Personal Data once it is no longer needed. In some cases, we choose to retain usage information in a depersonalized or aggregated form. Once aggregated, this information ceases to be Personal Data and will not be subject to our regular retention policies or subject to the exercise of your rights and choices as outlined above.
