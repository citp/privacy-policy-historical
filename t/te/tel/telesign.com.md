# Privacy Notice - TeleSign

TeleSign’s Privacy Notice (telesign.com)

This notice was last updated on May 17, 2016. 

**Why has the Privacy Notice Changed?**

The primary change reflected below is the removal of the reference to the Safe Harbor Framework which was invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in October 2015.  As a result, European and U.S. regulators and diplomats have been working to develop a replacement to address European data protection requirements.  In February 2016, the EU and U.S. announced the “EU-U.S. Privacy Shield” as a proposed successor to the Safe Harbor Framework.  TeleSign will evaluate the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program once it is finalized.   Until then we wanted all visitors to our website to clearly understand that by using our website and services, personal information may be sent to our facilities in the United States and elsewhere. Click [here to view the previous Privacy Notice](http://telesign.wpengine.com/privacy-notice-old).
