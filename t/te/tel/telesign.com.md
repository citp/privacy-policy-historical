A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our sites.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our sites, but your ability to use some areas of our sites, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.

**Access to Information**

To ensure that your personal information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date, we take reasonable steps whenever we collect or use it.

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove, ask to have it removed from a public forum, or testimonial on our sites by making the change on our client portal page or by contacting us via one of the methods listed in the contact section below.  We will respond to your request to access within 30 days.

If access to your personal information is denied, or TeleSign refuses to provide you with access, we will provide you with the appropriate non-access or refusal information.

We have no direct relationship to the data being processed within the TeleSign services. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to TeleSign’s Client (the data controller). If the Client requests us to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 business days.

**Safeguards and Security of Information**  
The security of your personal information and our Clients’ information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

TeleSign takes reasonable steps to protect the personal information that we hold. We safeguard the security of your data with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Your personal information may be stored either in hardcopy documents, as electronic data, or in TeleSign software or systems to help protect it from misuse, loss, unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.

TeleSign will take every reasonable step to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information that is no longer needed.

The TeleSign sites use advanced encryption on all web pages requiring personal information. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information when transmitted online.

**Communications**  
TeleSign may send you information about your account, about the products and services you purchased, or to remind you about upcoming events that you have signed up for. TeleSign does not send commercial electronic messages unless the relevant electronic account holder consents or TeleSign is otherwise permitted to send them. To unsubscribe from our alerts or announcements, simply access the unsubscribe option within the TeleSign email communications or unsubscribe via this email address: unsubscribe@telesign.com.
