Co-Branded Service Offerings:   
We may share this information with certain businesses with whom Telebrands has formed a strategic alliance. You may be able to identify these businesses because Telebrands has authorized them to display co-branded Web pages or links to Telebrands. These strategic partners are requested to clearly state their own privacy policies on their own web sites or promotional materials. If you do not want to have your personal information shared with these businesses you may click here.

Transaction Processing:   
We may use your Personal Information to create a convenient and easy-to-use shopping process that includes an online "shopping cart" that allows you to track selected products and proceed through purchase. Also we may share transactional information with entities as is necessary to process credit card payments or other purchasing or delivery systems.

Third-Party Offers:   
We may arrange to have marketing and promotional information of other companies sent to you that we think might be of interest to you.

Legal Requirement:   
We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform with the law, respond to claims or comply with legal process served on our company or the Site; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Site, our employees, guests or the public.

Company Sale:   
Information collected through our Site is considered a trade secret of Telebrands. As the owner of such information, we may disclose or sell such information as an asset of the company in conjunction with the sale to a third party of our company or a portion of our assets.
