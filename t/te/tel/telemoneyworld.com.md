# WIRECARD ASIA: Privacy

Wirecard AG and its subsidiaries (Wirecard group) offer products and services for electronic payments and risk management to their customers. Our aim is to enable companies and consumers to process electronic payments worldwide smoothly and easily. 

The security and protection of personal data is one of the most important aspects in processing payments. This is why Wirecard AG ensures compliance with the legal provisions on privacy, in particular in accordance with the provisions of the German Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the German Teleservices Act (TMG). 

This statement covers all key aspects of privacy. Please note the following information.

### Accountable body

Wirecard Technologies AG at Einsteinring 35, 85609 Aschheim, Germany, is the accountable body as defined by German law. 

Customers are accountable for all data processed as part of contracted data processing. Wirecard will refer to the respective customer in the event of any queries regarding this data. 

### Anonymous page view

As a rule, pages of the Wirecard group website can be viewed anonymously. Data that is collected automatically (see below) is anonymized prior to its being stored and used. 

### Collection and use of personal data

Wirecard processes payment information on behalf of her customers (merchants) as part of payment processing and related services (e.g. risk management). Particularly in its role as a data processor, Wirecard works through its affiliated customers towards compliance with the principle of data efficiency as defined under the German Data Protection Act. 

The affiliated customer (merchant) concerned is considered accountable for processed payment data. Sensitive data in particular, such as credit card numbers and account details, are processed as part of payment processing. This data is encrypted and stored in the Wirecard databases in compliance with PCI DSS regulations.

The data processed on behalf of an affiliated customer (merchant) is utilized only for the purpose requested by this customer - e.g. payment processing and risk management. Depending on the contracted service, additional information such as IP geolocation data and credit reports may also be consulted. 

Any and all data processed on behalf of a customer will be stored as specified by the customer and also deleted at the customer's request - at the latest, however, following expiry of the legal term. In the event that a customer requests removal of their data before expiry of this term, the data will usually be blocked instead of being deleted. 

### Disclosure of personal data

The companies of the Wirecard group utilize personal data only as requested by its affiliated customers (merchants). This data is disclosed exclusively to subcontractors of the Wirecard group for the purpose of completing the transaction. This data may be disclosed to relevant service providers, e.g. credit rating agencies, for the purpose of identity verification and fraud prevention. 

The data is not disclosed to other third parties - e.g. for the purpose of selling addresses.
