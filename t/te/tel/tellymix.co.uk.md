# Privacy and Cookies Policy | TellyMix

**Last revised: 25th May 2018**

This policy explains in detail how TellyMix (hereinafter "tellymix", "us", "we", "our") use any information collected during any visit by you (hereinafter "your", "visitor", “user")

We collect and process personal information in line with the The EU general data protection regulation (GDPR) in the following instances only:

### Contact forms

When you contact us we ask for your name and email address along with your query. We need this information in order to act on your query, covered by Article 6 (1) b) GDPR.

In addition, we store your IP address. Your IP address is logged for security and operating purposes (e.g. to block spam messages) under Article 6 (1) f) GDPR.

The above information is stored for 30 days before being automatically deleted. If you wish for this information to be deleted before then, please contact us (see below).

### Server logs

Our web server logs certain pieces of information when you visit a web page. This information includes your anonymised IP address, the page you visit and diagnostic information such as your web browser, web browser’s user agent and your operating system.

This not personal identifiable information is stored for up to one month and processed for error correction, troubleshooting and security purposes in our legitimate interest under Article 6 (1) f) GDPR to protect and provide reliable and error-free access to our website.

### Website statistics

We log information when you visit any of our websites. This information includes the pages you visit, your browser and operating system information and plug-in information.

None of this information identifies you personally.

This information is kept for up to one month on our server. The information is then processed and analysed to produce website statistics. We use these statistics to enhance your browsing experience by creating pages tuned to specific browsers and operating systems. We may also use the information collected to administer and troubleshoot technical problems.

### Mailing lists

We operate mailing lists to send news updates. When you sign up you are asked to provide an email address. In addition, the time and date of sign up and your IP address is stored.

We need this information in order to provide you with the email updates you have consented to (Article 6 (1) a) GDPR, (Article 6 (1) b) GDPR)), as well as to combat spam and abuse (Article 6 (1) f) GDPR).

This information is shared with MailChimp in the United States. Mail Chimp are a certified to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.

This information is stored for as long as you wish to be signed up to the mailing list. You can opt-out and have your personal information removed by clicking the link in any of the emails sent. Alternatively, you can request manual removal by contacting us (see below).

When you are removed from the mailing list, all traces of your personal information is deleted by MailChimp.

You can find MailChimp's [Privacy Policy here](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/) and [terms here](https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/).

You may change your Google ad settings at the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](https://www.google.co.uk/settings/ads).

If ad personalization is turned on, our partners will use your information during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.
