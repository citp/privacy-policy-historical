# TELUS Mobility Privacy Policy

**Privacy policy statement:  
Code of Fair Information Practices**

TELUS has made consumer privacy a high priority. We have a long-standing policy of protecting our customers' privacy in all our business operations. 

TELUS has the responsibility to protect the confidentiality of any information transmitted over the network and to safeguard the use of information customers may reasonably expect us to keep private. 

TELUS adopts the Canadian Standards Association privacy standard, Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information CAN/CSA-Q830-96 (CSA Standard). This is a voluntary code for ensuring the protection of consumer privacy. It is a respected cornerstone for addressing privacy issues. Its point of origin is the OECD's Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, adopted by the Government of Canada in 1984. 

We will maintain the confidentiality of personal information you provide to TELUS and use it only to support your customer relationship with TELUS. 

In protecting your privacy rights, TELUS: 

  * Safeguards customers' information from unauthorized access. 
  * Honors consumers' requests to remove their names from our telephone, e-mail, or mail solicitation lists. 
  * Strives to keep customer records current and accurate. 
  * Collects, maintains and uses customer information that is necessary to provide the most helpful and personalized products and services to meet consumers' needs. 
  * Maintains the confidentiality of customer information when undertaking projects with other companies. 
  * Honors requests from customers for account information the company has about them. 

In support of our commitment to privacy, TELUS has developed a Privacy Code that adopts the following CSA-approved customer information principles to guide business decisions and to earn our customers' trust. These principles seek to balance the application of information age technologies with the privacy concerns of consumers:
