# Telerivet: Privacy Policy

_Updated: January 29, 2016_

Welcome to Telerivet, the online and mobile service of Telerivet, Inc. ("Telerivet," "we," "us," or "our"). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that applies to our Service, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms).

### What is the purpose of this Privacy Policy?

This Privacy Policy discloses our personal information gathering and dissemination practices with respect to the Service. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

We have also created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. We recognize that when you provide us with information about yourself that you trust us to act in a responsible manner with that information.

### What information do we collect from users and how is it used?

The following describes the types of personal and other information we may collect about you, and how we use and maintain that information:

Registration
    Before you can utilize certain services that we offer on the Service or otherwise, we may ask that you register with Telerivet and provide us with your email address, a password, your name and other contact information. We request this information for identification purposes, to communicate with you regarding your account, and to facilitate the functioning of certain services.
Correspondence
    If you correspond with us via email, we may gather the information that you submit in a file specific to you.
URL and IP address
    Like many other websites, Telerivet collects information about users' utilization and navigation of our Service. This information helps us to design our Service to better suit our users' needs. For example, our Service will track the URL that you visited before you came to our Service, the URL to which you next go, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Service. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
Analytics information
    Telerivet may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. This analytics data may enable Telerivet to relate your use of our Service to personally identifying information that you previously submitted.
Log file information
    Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
Information Collected With Cookies
    

Like most major websites, Telerivet uses cookies on certain pages of our Service. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Service to personally identifying information that you previously submitted. The information that we collect with cookies allows us to statistically analyze Service usage, to improve our content and product offerings, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, and to customize our Service's content, layout and services. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. 

In addition, Telerivet uses third-party vendors, such as Google, to show ads for Telerivet on sites across the internet. These third-party vendors use cookies to serve ads based on your previous visits to Telerivet's website. To opt-out of these targeted ads, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). 

Commercial and marketing communications
    We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, technical and security notices). For certain Service-related e-mails, the only way to opt-out is to terminate your account with Telerivet. 

### To whom does Telerivet disclose information about you that we collect?

### What security measures does the Service employ?

To help protect the privacy of data you transmit through this Service, where personally identifiable information is requested, Telerivet uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the information that is sent between your computer and Telerivet's servers. In addition, Telerivet takes steps to protect the user data we collect against unauthorized access.

However, you should keep in mind that this Service and our services are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond our control.
