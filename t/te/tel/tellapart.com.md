The Site is intended primarily to offer information about TellApart and the services we provide.

**Information Collected via the Site**

We collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) from the Site when you choose to provide it to us. PII is information that can be used to identify a particular person or entity. This includes, but is not limited to: full name, postal address, telephone number, or email address. For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on this Site. We use this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry. We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) via the Site. Non-PII may include your IP address, pages viewed on this Site, browser type, user agent, Internet Service Provider, the time/date of your visit to this Site, and your computer’s operating system (e.g., Windows XP).

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We use “cookies” and other technology to help us manage this Site. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. We also use persistent cookies on this Site in order to help us manage the opt-out process for our Technology. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You may be able to remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

TellApart is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or content of such other websites. TellApart encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies whenever interacting with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website. TellApart has no control over the use of information by third party websites, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information to those websites.

### 2\. TellApart Technology — Information Collection and Use

**Overview of TellApart’s Technology and Data Collection**

Our Technology collects information about the website(s) that you visit and the advertisements that you see while online. We may collect data about you using our Technology in the following contexts: when TellApart or one of our Business Partners purchase online advertisements on a website that you visit (“Advertising Data”); and/or when one of our Business Partners or advertising technology partners uses our Technology on a website, which you visit (“Business Partner Data”). The type of Advertising Data we collect includes the number of advertisement requests received, the number of advertisements you are shown, the identity of the website you are visiting and the number of clicks you may make on a particular advertisement, but in all cases Advertising Data is Non-PII. The type of Business Partner Data we collect includes information regarding the pages and products you have viewed, the identity of products purchased, the time you spend on particular web pages and product price. Business Partner Data may in some cases include PII. However, we do not associate this information with the information that is separately gathered off the Business Partners’ websites through our online advertising activities.

We use the information collected by our Technology in order to help make the TellApart Ads you see more relevant to you, to improve our Technology, and for ad delivery and measurement purposes. We also may disclose Non-PII to our Business Partners in connection with the provision of TellApart Technology services.

**Cookies, JavaScript and Web Beacons**

TellApart uses cookies and other technologies in connection with our Technology and our collection of both Advertising Data and Business Partner Data. These types of technologies help TellApart better understand the effectiveness of a TellApart Ad (for example, by tracking the way in which you may respond to, select and interact with a TellApart Ad or any content provided therein, or the location and context in which you view a TellApart Ad). TellApart’s cookies also help control the number of times you view a TellApart Ad. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. Consult the help manual for your browser for detailed information. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites you visit.

TellApart also uses JavaScript and web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of these technologies allows TellApart to record that someone has visited a particular webpage, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon.

**Information Received from Other Third Parties**

In some cases, we may choose to work with third party data providers to support requirements that may arise from our Business Partners. For example, these providers may use our technology to combine anonymous third party data with the data collected by our technology in order to further tailor advertising content to their customers. In conjunction with information collected using our Technology, we use this information in order to help make the TellApart Ads you see more relevant to you, to improve our Technology, and for ad delivery, measurement and reporting purposes.

**Third Party Links and Websites**

TellApart Ads may contain links to other websites, including those of our Business Partners. Such websites may use cookies and/or other data collection tools. TellApart is not responsible for the privacy practices, policies or the content of such websites. TellApart encourages everyone to read the posted privacy policies when interacting with any website to learn more about the privacy practices of that website. TellApart has no control over the use of any information by third party websites, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information. Similarly, TellApart does not have access to, or control of, the cookies and/or other data collection tools that may be placed on any advertisement by a third-party, including those of our Business Partners, and this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies and/or other data collection tools by any third party.

### 3\. Our Disclosure of Information About You

There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share information about you with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

**Business Transfers and Affiliates** :

As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, information about you may be part of the transferred assets. We may also disclose information about you within our corporate family, including to our parent company, Twitter, Inc. You acknowledge and agree that any such recipient of information about you will have the right to use that information as disclosed herein.

**Agents, Consultants, Service Providers and Related Third Parties** :

### 4\. Information Security

The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.

You may opt out of TellApart’s interest-based advertising on this browser by clicking on the link below:

Kindly note that when you opt out, TellApart records that choice in your browser cookies. If after opting out, you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, then your browser will no longer have a record of your opt­-out status and you will need to renew your opt-out choice for that browser.

**For mobile applications:**

Your iOS device may provide a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting. On Android devices, your settings may allow you to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads.” When you have opted out using one of these settings, TellApart will neither (1) use in-app information collected from that device to infer your interests nor (2) serve ads to that device that are targeted based on your inferred interests.

Please note that while opting out limits TellApart’s collection of information to serve ads based on your inferred interests as well as your receipt of interest-based ads from TellApart, it does not prevent you from receiving targeted ads from MoPub, Twitter, or other third parties. Also note that you may continue to receive contextual ads from TellApart after opting out.
