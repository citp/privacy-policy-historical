Your privacy and security are very important to us at Telestream and we understand that it is very important to our customers as well. When we ask you to register or to provide personal information when you visit certain areas of our website, it is for the sole purpose of supporting and enhancing our relationship with you, for example, to download software, provide service and support, and share product and company news and offerings with you.
