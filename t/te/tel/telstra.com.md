# Telstra - Privacy statement (including Credit Reporting Policy)

This statement is the privacy policy of Telstra Corporation Ltd and its wholly owned Australian subsidiaries. It sets out how we manage your personal information and other information. Before we go into the detail, we need to define a few terms. This bit can get a bit technical, so please bear with us:

Your information: When we refer to your information, we are referring to both your personal information, as defined under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), and any customer information protected by Part 13 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth).

Sensitive information: The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) defines some types of personal information as sensitive. We don’t commonly collect sensitive information, which includes information about a person's race, ethnic origin, political opinions, health, religious or philosophical beliefs and criminal history.  In the event we require any sensitive information we would only collect this with your permission, and we will only use it for the purpose for which you provided it.

Credit Reporting Policy: This sets out how we manage your credit information and credit eligibility information where this is relevant to you, and is our credit reporting policy for the purposes of Part IIIA of the Privacy Act.

This credit reporting policy relates to Telstra and to our related entities that are deemed to be credit providers or affected information recipients for the purposes of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).  

We may provide credit as contemplated in the Privacy Act to our customers in connection with our products and services (for example, post-paid accounts) and, as a result, we may collect credit information and credit eligibility information about you as referred to in the Privacy Act. Our Credit Reporting Policy sets out how we manage that information.

### How we collect and hold credit information and credit eligibility information about you

Credit information relates primarily to your credit related dealings with us and covers various types of information that can be collected by Credit Reporting Bodies ( **CRBs** ) that report on consumer credit worthiness.

Credit information includes:

  * identification information
  * basic information about your credit account (for example when it was opened)
  * details about information requests we make about you to CRBs
  * information about certain overdue payments, default listings and about serious credit infringements and information about payments or subsequent arrangements in relation to either of these
  * various publicly available information like bankruptcy and credit-related court judgements



We may collect credit information about you in any of the circumstances relating to other personal information described in our Privacy Statement under How we collect your information. Credit eligibility information is information equivalent to the kinds listed above that we generally collect from CRBs.

This information relates primarily to your dealings with other credit providers (for example, banks, other financial institutions, or other organisations that may provide you with credit in connection with their products or services). It may also include certain credit worthiness information that we derive from the data that we receive from a CRB. Sometimes we may also collect credit eligibility information about you from other credit providers.

We store and safeguard your credit information and credit eligibility information in the ways described in our Privacy Statement under How we hold your information.

### How we use and when we disclose your credit information and credit eligibility information

We may disclose your credit information to CRBs. Those CRBs may then include that information in credit reporting information that they provide to other credit providers to assist them to assess your credit worthiness.

We may also use and disclose your credit information for other purposes and in other circumstances as described in our Privacy Statement under How we use your information and When we disclose your information, when permitted to do so by the Privacy Act.

Our use and disclosure of credit eligibility information is regulated by Part IIIA of the Privacy Act and the Credit Reporting Privacy Code. We will only use or disclose such information for purposes permitted by these laws, such as:

  * processing credit-related applications and managing credit that we provide
  * assisting you to avoid defaults
  * collecting amounts you may owe us in relation to such credit and dealing with serious credit infringements
  * assigning our debts
  * participating in the credit reporting system
  * dealing with complaints or regulatory matters relating to credit or credit reporting
  * when required or authorised by another law.



In some cases, the people to whom we may disclose your credit information or credit eligibility information may be based outside Australia – for more information please see the details in our Privacy Statement under When we disclose your information.

### How to access or correct your credit information or credit eligibility information

If you wish to access or correct errors in any of your credit information or credit eligibility information that we hold, please contact us using the contact details in the How to contact us section in our Privacy Statement.

We may apply an administrative charge for providing access to your credit eligibility information, depending on the request.

### How to make a complaint regarding our compliance with Part IIIA of the Privacy Act and these Credit Reporting Privacy Term

If you think that we have not complied with Part IIIA of the Privacy Act or with the Credit Reporting Privacy Code (which regulates credit reporting) you can make a complaint by using the contact details in the How to contact us section of our Privacy Statement.

We will acknowledge your complaint in writing as soon as practicable within 7 days. We will aim to investigate and resolve your complaint within 30 days of receiving it. If we need more time, we will notify you about the reasons for  
the delay and ask for your agreement to extend this 30 day period (if you do not agree, we may not be able to resolve your complaint).

We may need to consult with a CRB or another credit provider to investigate your complaint. While we hope that we will be able to resolve any complaint without needing to involve third parties, if you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint you can access our external dispute resolution scheme, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman ([www.tio.com.au](http://www.tio.com.au/)), or make a complaint to the Australian Information Commissioner ([www.oaic.gov.au](http://www.oaic.gov.au/)).
