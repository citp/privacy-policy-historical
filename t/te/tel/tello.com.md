Also, this Privacy Policy covers Company's treatment of any Personal Information that Company's business partners share with Company, or that you provide to the Company through a third party website using a Company application. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.

Company does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Website or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.

## WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY DISPLAY OR COLLECT?

When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile, form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with Company through the Website. In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your "friend" list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.

### Personal Information You Provide to Us:

We receive and store any information you enter on the Website, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include, without limitation, your name, user name, email address, IP address, browser information, password, photograph, and physical location, and log-in information for third party websites (which may include, without limitation, Facebook and Twitter).You may choose not to provide us with, or authorize the automatic transmission of, certain information, but then you may not be able to register for the Website or take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove the Personal Information identified below (under "What Personal Information Can I Access?") at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and account information.

### Personal Information Collected Automatically:

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or our services. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Company cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Website.

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components and location you are accessing the Services from, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Company only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and the Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Company never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

### Email Communications:

We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Company if your computer or device supports this type of program. Company uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user lists to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.

### What About Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's (or other device's) hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Company cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you may not be able to log in or use many of the Website's most attractive features without cookies enabled.

Ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer or other device each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer or device. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Company or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
