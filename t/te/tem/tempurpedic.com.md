The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what information we collect from you, how we use and share such information, and the choices you have regarding our collection and use.

 **Information Covered By This Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected about you by Tempur Sealy.  As used herein, “ **Personal Information** ” means information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, phone number or credit card number, and “ **Non-Personal Information** ” ** ** means information that relates to you but does not directly identify you. “ **Information** ” is collectively used herein to refer to both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third parties or any websites that might be linked to our Online Services or products.

 **Personal Information.**   Personal Information includes your name, address (both billing and shipping addresses), e-mail address, credit card information, and/or phone number.
