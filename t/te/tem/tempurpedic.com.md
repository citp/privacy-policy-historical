# Tempur-Pedic® - Customer Service - Privacy Policy

You know and trust Tempur-Pedic and we value your trust. We want you to know how we collect, use and protect information about our online guests. 

WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT GUESTS DO WE COLLECT? 

Information You Give Us   
We receive and may store any information you enter on our website or give to our website in any other way. For example, we collect information you provide when you place an order, register with us, send us an e-mail or call us. This information may include: 

• your name.   
• your mailing address.   
• your e-mail address.   
• your phone number.   
• your credit card number. 

It may also include any other personal or preference information you provide to us.  It may also include information you submit about other people, for example, the name and address of a gift recipient. 

Information from Other Sources   
We may receive information about you from other sources. This may help improve the personalization of our service to you by providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you. 

Automatic Information   
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our website.  For example, we use “cookies” like many other websites. Through “cookies” we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses our website. There are utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we cannot provide you with a personalized experience or certain services at our website if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. 

What are “Cookies” and how do we use them?   
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser. Cookies allow us to provide storage of items in your Cart between visits or improved services when viewing or shopping on our website. 

The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of our website’s best features, so we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

DOES YOUR WEBSITE SHARE INFORMATION THAT IT RECEIVES? 

Tempur-Pedic   
We share information we collect at our website within Tempur-Pedic. Tempur-Pedic may use this information to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you. 

Carefully Selected Companies and Organizations   
We may share information with carefully selected vendors, business partners and other organizations, which are not part of Tempur-Pedic. These companies and organizations may use the information we share to provide special opportunities and offers to you. 

Service Providers   
Our website may also share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer, mailing house or web host) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose. 

Protection of Our Website and Others   
We may disclose information you provide to our website when we believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply our Terms + Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of our website, our users or others. 

Business Transfers   
If some or all of the business assets of our website are sold or transferred, we generally would transfer the corresponding information regarding our guests. We also may retain a copy of that guest information. 

WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?

WHAT ABOUT LINKS TO AND FROM OTHER WEBSITES? 

Our website may offer links to other sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. In addition, you may have linked to our website through another site. For example, in certain cases you may have linked to tempurpedic.com through banner advertising on another site. In such cases the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information. 

APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY 

This privacy policy applies to all information collected or submitted on our website. 

In addition, other members of Tempur-Pedic may obtain information independently from their transactions and experiences with you or from other sources. This privacy policy does not apply to that information. 

Children   
We recognize the particular importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We are committed to protecting children’s privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child has provided our website with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian call 1-800-440-0680 or email [drsupportemail@tempurpedicdr.com](mailto:drsupportemail@tempurpedicdr.com) and we will delete the information about the child from our files. 

Your Consent   
By using our website, you consent to our use of information that is collected or submitted as described in this online privacy policy. We may change or add to this privacy policy so we encourage you to review it periodically. To help you track changes we will include a history of material changes at the end of this privacy policy. This history will begin as of the end of December 2007 and will include the date the privacy policy was last updated and a description of any material changes. 

SECURITY 

Our Commitment to Data Security   
We have appropriate physical, electronic and procedural security safeguards to protect and secure the information we collect. 

Secure Sockets Layering (SSL)   
Our website uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online at our website is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone. 

Safe Shopping Guarantee   
Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing and using your credit card number. In addition, consumer protection laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, if your credit card is used without your authorization, your liability for those fraudulent charges cannot exceed $50. So, if someone steals your credit card or your credit card number, your liability is limited to $50 no matter how much the thief charges to your account. If your credit card provider does hold you liable for any part of this $50, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. 

We will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at our website while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
