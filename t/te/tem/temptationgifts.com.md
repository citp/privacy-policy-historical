## Data Protection

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. We will not e-mail you in the future if you do not want us to do so. We will not pass your e-mail address to other traders under any circumstances.

We collect information about you for 2 reasons: firstly, to process your order and second, to provide you with the best possible service. The information we will collect includes: your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit/debit card details (which are inaccessible even to us from moment of purchase). We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. The information we hold will be accurate and up to date.

In accordance with the law, you can if you wish check the information that we hold about you by e-mailing us. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct them promptly. The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and the law. In the unlikely event that we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will obtain your consent first. 

## Cookies

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files that can be stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. These files are typically used to hold your user preferences, to store important data as you browse the website (such as the contents of your shopping cart), or to find out if you have browsed the website before.

As these files can only store small amounts of data there is nothing dangerous about the files themselves, but some companies may use the information to track what other websites you have visited or to build a profile of your online behaviour. TemptationGifts do not involve themselves in these activities.

### What cookies does TemptationGifts use and why?

TemptationGifts, like most e-commerce websites, uses a variety of cookies to help ensure that our website functions correctly and to provide information on how to improve our pages and marketing. Our use of cookies can be broken down into three main categories:

**Functional** \- The majority of cookies we use are designed to make sure our website operates properly and to enhance our customers' experience.

We use cookies to keep track of preferences that you have set so that they are applied on the pages you visit, to remember the contents of your shopping cart or whether you are logged in as you browse the website, and to record the items that you have placed in your wish-list so that you can refer back to them.

**Advertising** \- Cookies are used to track the performance of our online advertising campaigns through Google, Bing and their partners. They give us information about how many people have bought from us after interacting with one of our adverts. This helps us to keep our adverts informative and relevant to our customers. All the information collected is anonymous and no personal data is recorded.

We also use cookies to provide a remarketing service through Google Adwords, which allows us to advertise specifically to internet users that have previously visited our website, and to highlight products and services that we believe may be of interest to them. This advertising method allows us to show adverts to users with different interests and demographics based on the information that Google provide. You can view, edit and remove the information associated within this remarketing cookie by visiting Google's [Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences). If you would rather opt out from seeing our remarketing adverts, you can use the previous link or adjust your internet browser's cookie settings.

**Website Analytics** \- We also use cookies to help analyse how our visitors in general interact with our website. This gives us information such as how many people visited our pages, how many visitors have been to our website previously, which links people have clicked most often on our pages, etc. This helps us to identify problems with our pages and advise on improvements that can be made to make them easier to use. All the information collected is anonymous and no personal data is recorded.

### How can cookies be managed or disabled?

You can easily change the way cookies are handled on your computer by adjusting the cookie settings within your internet browser. It is possible to manage which websites are allowed to create cookies on your computer as well as view or delete cookies that have already been stored.

There are many different internet browsers so we aren't able to give instructions on how to change the privacy and cookie settings in all of them, but we've provided links to the websites of the most popular browsers below. Please note: Blocking all cookies from TemptationGifts.com will prevent the Shopping Cart from functioning correctly and you will be unable to place an order through the website. You can still place an order over the phone with our Customer Service team on 01494 790420.
