# Privacy & Freedom in the Information Age

The main reason or excuse of why businesses and government institutions want your private information is because of misguided culture of using it to authenticate you remotely, since only you know your social security, date of birth, mother’s maiden name, the name of your first pet, etc. etc. etc.

Maybe that’s was a fair assumption long time ago when records were kept on paper in a locked drawer or a safe. These days your private information is kept electronically in dozens if not hundreds of places and was probably already siphoned off by hackers. Unlike passwords, private information is immutable; it is either impossible or very difficult to change. In the wrong hands, your private information can FOREVER be used to impersonate you.

If all businesses and government institutions stop the use of personal information, including biometrics, for remote authentication purposes, identity theft would disappear overnight.

There would no longer be any excuse to collect private information that is not pertinent to the relationship. When not physically present, information about you describes YOU, it doesn’t prove who you ARE. The only absolute proof of identity is collection of biometric information in person. All further remote authentications can be achieved with the help of public key cryptography. With modern technology it is possible to keep hundreds of one-to-one private relationships. If you lose your ‘relationship’ keys, you can go in person to a trusted location, submit your biometrics and set up new keys. Any significant, possibly life changing, transactions should be done in person. Impatience is not an excuse for urgency.
