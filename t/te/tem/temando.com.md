Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested will include contact information (as supplied to the site during registration) and supplementary information on your professional interests, opinions and preferences (e.g. choice of software, working practices, opinions on industry issues, feedback on the Temando web site). We will use the contact information to notify winners. We will not publish winners' details on the site though on request we will provide details of any winners' name and organisation. If the survey or contest has a sponsor then we will share information given by entrants with the sponsor.

**Payment Processing  
** In order to process payments online we require the billing address for the credit card used and our external payment service provider, eWAY, requires your credit card details. For details of how your information is used, please see following section.

**Our Use of Your Information  
** We use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to  **statistically analyse site usage** , to improve our content and product offerings and to customise our site's content, layout, and services. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs.

We use your  **e-mail address**  to send you newsletters or other communications (for example, digests of the forum posts) that you have requested from the Site. Out of respect for our users we offer an opt-out (see 4. below).

We use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve any disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular on rare occasions we may evaluate your information to look for users using multiple User IDs or alias.

**Payment Processing  
** We take online payments for our online freight quoting and booking service. We use eWAY as our external payment provider. In addition to the information outlined above, we require the billing address of the credit card you use so that we can pass this to eWAY who check the address against the cardholder's details for security purposes. eWAY requires that you provide your credit card details to process the transaction. This is done on a secure eWAY server using SSL (secure sockets layer). In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, Temando may be contacted for the sole purpose of performing further checks. These details are stored securely on an eWAY PCI Compliant (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) server in order to process future payments you may make, but eWAY does not use your information for any other purpose.

Your Personal Information, which is not inclusive of full card details, is stored in our databases, which are located in Australia. Please note that the information you enter may at some time be transferred outside the country for the purposes of processing by Temando or any of its affiliates. By submitting your information, you consent to this transfer.
