      Tempe in Touch<br>
      City of Tempe web site<br>
      Privacy policy<br>
      April 30, 2001</font>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Will the City of Tempe disclose the information it collects to outside
      parties?</b><br>
      The City of Tempe does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information
      to others. The City of Tempe may provide aggregate statistics about our
      customers, traffic patterns, and related site information to other
      government agencies, but these statistics will include no personal
      identifying information. The City of Tempe may release account information
      when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary
      to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user
      agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of the City of
      Tempe, our users, or others.</font></p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Your consent</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
      By using the Tempe in Touch web site, you consent to the collection and
      use of this information by the City of Tempe. If we decide to change our
      privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you 
      always have the opportunity to be aware of what information we collect,
      how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Forms</b><br>
		All forms on our site should be set to automatically run as secured 
		forms.&nbsp; That means you should see the same security lock indication 
		on your browser as you would if you were in a shopping cart or banking 
		site.&nbsp; In the event that you find a form that is not secure please 
		report it to <a href="mailto:webmaster@tempe.gov">webmaster@tempe.gov</a> 
		with the web address of the form.&nbsp; To make any page on the 
		Tempe.gov web site secure you may add an 's' to the web address right 
		after the http in the address line.&nbsp; For example, this page would 
		be <a href="https://www.tempe.gov/privacy.htm">
		https://www.tempe.gov/privacy.htm</a> (updated 8/2005)</font></p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Specifically Cookies<br>
      </font>
      </b><font face="Arial" size="2">The technical term for tracking a visitor on a web site is ‘Cookies’.
      Some maintain that cookies, in any form, are bad. We agree that they ‘can’
      be bad, however, there are important technical reasons to use cookies in
      limited situations, and the Tempe web site does use cookies in a limited
      manner as stated below.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is important to understand what a cookie is and how it works in
      order to understand how and why we use it. When someone visits a web site,
      they are requesting a page of information, and that information is sent to
      their browser, and their connection to the web site is then broken within
      seconds. The web site has no record of who just received the page. For
      most visits this is fine. This is a transaction that does not require
      cookies and is the most common.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A cookie is a very small file that is stored on the visiting users
      computer by their browser when requested by the web server. For example,
      if you are using web pages that are more sophisticated than standard
      pages, the web server might need a way to determine one user from another.
      Remember, you are only connected for a few seconds and hundreds of others
      might be served before you get your next page from the server.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lets take an example of a multi-page form on the web. As you fill in
      one form and move on to the next, the server will need a way to remember
      where you are in the form process, and what previous forms you have filled
      in so that it can keep them together. When you submit page one there is a
      cookie stored on your computer with a temporary id tag and a marker saying
      what web server gave it to you. This cookie will not have any personal
      information and takes less space on your hard drive than one line in this
      document. Now, as you bring up page two, the server asks your browser if
      you have a cookie, and that id tag information is sent to the server, thus
      reminding it who you are – as opposed to the other 100 people filling
      out the same form at the same time. This process basically keeps you in a
      personal exchange with the server.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have ever purchased something over the web the vendor uses
      cookies to keep track of you and from that they can track what you have
      already selected in your shopping cart.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cookies can also be used for more devious things. Tracking how many
      times 'you' specifically come to a web site for example. Tracking what pages
      'you' visit while you are at that site. These are tracking 'your' behavior,
      and this is considered bad.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The City will not use cookies, or any other technology, to track
      individuals on our web site. The only exception, as stated in the example
      above, would be to keep transactions open between the server and user
      during a session with an application. Those sessions usually expire 20
      minutes after the last web page access, and in many cases, it’s never
      actually stored as a cookie file and expires as soon as the browser is
      closed.</font></p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Email<br>
      </font>
      </b><font face="Arial" size="2">Email as well as certain other documents in the City may be considered
      public record. Email sent to the mayor and any city council members are
      automatically forwarded to the media by their request.</font></p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Cameras<br>
      </font>
      </b><font face="Arial" size="2">Live cameras are used on the web site as a 
      form of public relations. Although there are no laws pertaining to video 
      and privacy (only audio or video with audio) we will continue to respect 
      the privacy of our citizens. The cameras used on the web site will remain 
      distant and unfocused enough that individual identification will be very 
      unlikely. Sound will never be captured or broadcast. The cameras are for 
      showing visitors the weather and general activity in the area. The only 
      time the cameras may be used for surveillance will be during a large crowd 
      event on Mill Avenue such as the Block Party, July 4th, or the Arts 
      Festivals as examples.</font></p>
      <b>
      </b><p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Tell us what you think</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
      The City of Tempe welcomes your questions and comments about the privacy
      policy.
      Please send e-mail to <a href="webmaster@tempe.gov">webmaster@tempe.gov</a>.</font></p>
