This policy was last updated on October 5, 2009.

Below is the Tether Tools (“TT”) privacy and security policy:

Security:

The security of your personal information is very important to us. In an effort to protect your personal information, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology with 128 bit encryption. If your browser supports SSL (most current browsers do), it will automatically encrypt the information you provide to us on the secure pages on our site, before sending it over the Internet.

TT has obtained a digital certificate from [Go Daddy](http://www.godaddy.com/default.aspx "Go Daddy"), a leading provider of Internet trust services.

To authenticate the security of your connection before submitting any of your personal information, you can double click on the icon to display our digital certificate.

Cookies:

When you visit our site, we may ask your browser to place a permanent “cookie” (a very small text file) on your computer. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, it will accept the cookie and place it on your computer’s hard drive. We collect this information to analyze where our customers are coming from and how often they visit our site. We also collect certain technical information from your computer, like your IP address and the address of a referring web site, if any. This information will allow us to enhance our site to our customer’s preferences. This information is used only for the benefit of TT and you, our customer.

You can visit our site without cookies if you choose to do so. However, please be aware that some features of the site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. To visit our site without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. Check the browsers help menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

If you place an order with a ship-to address that differs from your bill-to address, we retain this information. You can modify or correct this information by following the procedure described above. Such information is used at your request to ship purchased merchandise and may also be used for marketing purposes, but will not be sold to any third parties.

Placing an order:

When you decide to place an order, you are asked to complete an order form. The order form requires your name, billing and shipping address, credit card number, expiration date and CID#. You should also include other information fields such as your telephone number, to allow us to contact you regarding your order if necessary. This information is collected to make your shopping experience with us as smooth and pleasant as possible. It is used only for the benefit of TT and you, our customer.

Links:

Our site contains links to manufacturers, and other related sites for your benefit. TT is not responsible for the privacy practices, security, or content of such web sites. If you click on one of these links, you will be redirected to their web site and, in doing so, you may provide information directly to them. Therefore, you should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information and what choices you have.

Relationships/Sharing Information:

TT maintains special relationships with a number of secure business partners. For your security or benefit, when you make a purchase, we may share information about you and the transaction with other companies for many reasons including verification, fraud prevention, credit card authorization, and shipping purposes.

TT may share account or other information when we are required by law or to protect our interests or property. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents or government agencies in connection with issues related to fraud, credit or debt collection.

You agree that TT may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.

TT may also share information with outside companies that perform services for TT. For example, when a customer signs up for our e-mail newsletters, TT will provide the customers e-mail address to third party e-mail distribution companies that transmit e-mails on behalf of TT. Your e-mail address will not be used by these companies for any purpose other than for the transmission of e-mails for TT.

We may retain outside companies to assist us in managing our customer information database or to update and correct customer information for future marketing purposes. TT takes steps to ensure the confidentiality of your information and to make sure it is not used for other purposes.

For more information about the companies with whom TT shares customer information, please [contact us](mailto:customerservice@tethertools.com "customer service").

We may use your information in a number of ways, including the following:

  * To improve the content on our Web site. For example, we may use cookies to find out which parts of our site or our products are visited most often.
  * To enhance your online shopping experience.
  * For marketing and promotional purposes.



Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:
