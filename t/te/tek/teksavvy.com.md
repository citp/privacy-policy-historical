1.3   The TekSavvy Companies are responsible for personal information in their possession or control, including information that has been transferred to a third party for processing. The TekSavvy Companies shall use appropriate means to provide a comparable level of protection while information is being processed by a third party (see Principle 7).

1.4  The TekSavvy Companies have implemented policies and procedures to give effect to the Privacy Policy, including:

a)      implementing procedures to protect personal information and to oversee the TekSavvy Companies' compliance with the Privacy Policy;

d)     developing public information to explain the TekSavvy Companies' policies and practices.

Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes for Collection of Personal Information  
The TekSavvy Companies shall identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at or before the time the information is collected.

Upon request, persons collecting personal information shall explain these identified purposes or refer the individual to a designated person within the TekSavvy Companies who shall explain the purposes.

2.3   Unless required by law, the TekSavvy Companies shall not use or disclose, for any new purpose, personal information that has been collected without first identifying and documenting the new purpose and obtaining the consent of the customer or employee.

Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure of Personal Information  
The knowledge and consent of a customer or employee is required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.

3.1   In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example, the TekSavvy Companies may collect or use personal information without knowledge or consent if it is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as when the individual is a minor, seriously ill or mentally incapacitated.  
The TekSavvy Companies may also collect, use or disclose personal information without knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law.  
The TekSavvy Companies may also use or disclose personal information without knowledge or consent in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security of an individual is threatened.  
The TekSavvy Companies may disclose personal information without knowledge or consent to a lawyer representing the TekSavvy Companies, to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or as may be otherwise required by law.

Purposes shall be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the customer or employee.

3.3   Generally, the TekSavvy Companies shall seek consent to use and disclose personal information at the same time they collect the information. However, the TekSavvy Companies may seek consent to use and disclose personal information after it has been collected but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.

3.4   The TekSavvy Companies will require customers to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as a condition of the supply of a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure is required to fulfill the identified purposes.

3.5   In determining the appropriate form of consent, the TekSavvy Companies shall take into account the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of their customers and employees.

3.6    In general, the use of products and services by a customer, or the acceptance of employment or benefits by an employee, constitutes implied consent for the TekSavvy Companies to collect, use and disclose personal information for all identified purposes.

3.7   A customer or employee may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Customers and employees may contact the TekSavvy Companies for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing consent.

c)    another entity for the development, enhancement, marketing or provision of any of the products or services of the TekSavvy Companies;

d)   an agent retained by the TekSavvy Companies in connection with the collection of the customer's account;

e)    credit grantors and reporting agencies;

f)    a person who, in the reasonable judgment of the TekSavvy Companies, is seeking the information as an agent of the customer; and

g)   a third party or parties, where the customer consents to such disclosure or disclosure is required by law.

5.3   The TekSavvy Companies may disclose personal information about their employees:

a)    for normal personnel and benefits administration;

5.5   The TekSavvy Companies shall keep personal information only as long as it remains necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or as required by law. Depending on the circumstances, where personal information has been used to make a decision about a customer or employee, the TekSavvy Companies shall retain, for a period of time that is reasonably sufficient to allow for access by the customer or employee, either the actual information or the rationale for making the decision.

5.6   The TekSavvy Companies shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to personal information that is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or required by law to be retained. Such information shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.

Personal information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.

Personal information shall be provided in understandable form within a reasonable time and at minimal or no cost to the individual.

9.2    In certain situations, the TekSavvy Companies may not be able to provide access to all of the personal information that they hold about a customer or employee. For example, the TekSavvy Companies may not provide access to information if doing so would likely reveal personal information about a third party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual. Also, the TekSavvy Companies may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law. If access to personal information cannot be provided, the TekSavvy Companies shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request.

9.4   In order to safeguard personal information, a customer or employee may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit the TekSavvy Companies to account for the existence, use and disclosure of personal information and to authorize access to the individual's file.

The Privacy Policy reflects our most recent policies setting out your rights and our obligations respecting the treatment of your personal information by the TekSavvy Companies. The Privacy Policy complies with the requirements of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act as well as the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. (A summary of the principles underlying the Privacy Policy is included in Section II above.)

Q.        How do the TekSavvy Companies ensure that their employees and agents adhere to the Privacy Policy when handling personal information?  
A.         Employees and agents acting on our behalf are required to adhere to the Privacy Policy.

All of our employees must review and commit to the Privacy Policy annually.

Q.        What is personal information?  
A.         Personal information is information about an identifiable individual. This includes information about your product and service subscriptions and usage. Publicly available information, such as a public directory listing of your name, address, telephone number, electronic address, is not considered to be personal information.

Q.        Why does TekSavvy collect information?

Q.        Why do we share information among the TekSavvy Companies?  
A.        Sharing information among the TekSavvy Companies helps us understand your full needs and serve you better. Such sharing helps us identify your information, communication, and entertainment needs, and provide you with relevant information, advice, products and services. In some cases, certain products and service are available only from some of the TekSavvy Companies and not others. Therefore, in such cases, the sharing of information may also be necessary for the provision of certain bundles of products and/or services. Should you identify incorrect or outdated information to us, we will make the necessary changes promptly.

Q.           Can I withdraw my consent to the sharing of information among the TekSavvy Companies when such sharing is for the purpose of promoting products and services?

However, there are certain limited circumstances, outlined below, in which it is necessary to do so. When we do provide personal information to third parties, we provide only that information that is required in the circumstances. Information provided to third parties is used only for the purpose stipulated and is subject to strict terms of confidentiality. Employees of the companies to whom we may provide information must adhere to our privacy standards.

·         Law enforcement agencies, in emergencies, for internal security matters, or where required by court order or search warrant; and

·         Emergency services, in emergency situations.

Q.        How do the TekSavvy Companies safeguard personal information?  
A.         We take all of the necessary precautions to ensure the safeguarding of your information, whether it is stored electronically or in paper format. In all cases, information is retained in secure facilities, protected from unauthorized access and kept only as long as is reasonably required. For example, our electronic files are backed up for redundancy, password protected and accessible only by authorized employees, on a need-to-know basis.
