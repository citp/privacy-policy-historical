# Privacy and Cookies Policy | General | Terms and Conditions | About us | Tesco Mobile

At Tesco Mobile, we’re working hard to serve shoppers a little better every day.  Looking after the personal data you share with us is a hugely important part of this.  We want you to be confident that your data is safe and secure with us, and understand how we use it to offer you a better and more personalised experience.

We are committed to doing the right thing when it comes to how we collect, use and protect your personal data.  That’s why we’ve developed this privacy policy (“Policy”), which –

  * Sets out the types of personal data that we collect;
  * Explains how and why we collect and use your personal data;
  * Details when and why we will share personal data;
  * Details when and why we will share personal data within the Tesco Goup and with third parties; and
  * Explains the rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data.



## What this Policy covers

The __Data__ Controller is Tesco  Mobile Limited (collectively referred to as “we” or “us” in this Policy).

We offer different products and services, so we want you to be clear about what the Policy covers.  If you –

  * Shop with us over the phone, online or otherwise use any website ("our Website") or mobile applications ("our Mobile Apps") where this Policy is posted; or
  * Use our mobile communications network (the "Network")



(collectively known as “our Services”), then this Policy applies to you.  This Policy also applies if you contact us or interact with us with regard to our Services.

Some other parts of our business and __other Tesco Group companies__ may need to collect and use personal data to provide you with their products and services and for certain other purposes.  They have their own privacy policies that explain how they use your personal data.

Our Website or Mobile Apps may contain links to other websites operated by third parties that have their own privacy policies.  Please make sure you read their terms and conditions and privacy policy carefully before you submit any personal data to a third party website as we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these third party websites.

  * Your personal details, including your postal and billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and date of birth and title;

  * Your debit card details, bank details and other information;

  * Your account login details, such as your username and the password that you have chosen.

We don't look at the content of your messages or listen to your calls (unless you are talking to one of our customer service advisors)

  * So we can connect you to our Network, we need to know your location when you make or receive phone calls, messages or use the internet. We call this network location, it finds you through phone masts nearby and only knows roughly where you are so that we can put calls and texts through or connect you to the Internet


  
  
_**Additional sources of personal data**_

We may supplement the data we collect with personal data from other sources, such as specialist companies that supply data, companies that operate online media channels, our Retail Partners and public registers.  For example, this additional data helps us to – 

  * review and improve the accuracy of the data we hold;
  * improve and measure the effectiveness of our marketing communications, including online advertising.



We also access Clubcard information from Tesco Stores and may access information where permissible from Tesco Bank.  We may take this information into account when assessing credit risk. For example, we may take into account a Clubcard holder’s loyalty reflected in Clubcard transactions.  This means that Clubcard information can improve your eligibility for our credit and insurance products.
