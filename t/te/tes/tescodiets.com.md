**eDiets Privacy Policy**

eDiets is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how all personal information collected via eDiets will be used. 

Tesco owns the exclusive licence to run eDiets in the UK and Ireland. 

If you have any queries or requests concerning your personal information please see the customer service details below.

**Information Collected**

eDiets requests personal information when you sign up for our services, including your name, email address and other (mainly health-related) information in order to provide you with a personalised programme. eDiets also collects other information about your use of the service and eDiets web site. This information (excluding details of payment cards used, which are only handled by a secure online payment agent) is provided direct to eDiets UK.

eDiets UK also monitors customer traffic patterns and site use in order to improve the service provided. However, information that can identify a visitor, such as a name or address, is not collected in this process, nor does eDiets require disclosure of such information, unless the customer subscribes to the service. Information that can identify a visitor is collected only when the visitor provides it voluntarily.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

  
**Use of your information and your preferences**

eDiets UK will use your information to: 

  * provide and improve its services
  * understand customers' shopping habits
  * contact you with offers and information about the products and services of eDiets and Tesco and those of carefully selected parties



You can opt-out of receiving promotional communications at any time by visiting [www.edietsUK.com/remove](https://web.archive.org/remove), and changing your preferences.

Please note that there may be instances where it may be necessary for eDiets UK or Tesco to communicate with you, in any event, for administrative or operational reasons relating to eDiets.

**Disclosures of your information**

eDiets UK would like to reassure you that your details are safe and will never be released to companies outside the Tesco Group for their marketing purposes. Given the global nature of Tesco's business, your information may be disclosed on an international basis as part of the provision of the Service by Tesco.

eDiets UK may share your details among Tesco companies at home and abroad (e.g. Tesco Personal Finance), any successors in title to Tesco's business and businesses that process information on our behalf (e.g. printers who need certain details to print mailings).

If you subscribe to the eDiets Recipe Club, eDiets UK will share your information with the third party provider of the eDiets Recipe Club for the purposes of giving you access to this service.

eDiets UK may also use and share information relating to groups of customers, without identifying individuals, to learn more about customer behaviour and find ways of enhancing our service.

**Other web sites**

eDiets may contain links to other web sites that are outside Tesco and eDiet UK's control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you access other sites using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you that will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ from this one.
