        TestMasters reserves the right to append or otherwise modify this Privacy Policy
        at any time, so please revisit this page periodically to check for modifications.
    </p>
    <h3>Collected Information</h3>
    <p>
        TestMasters collects various types of information from our visitors in order to
        make adjustments to our websites and to better meet the needs of our users. Some
        of this information is automatically collected through cookies. Other information
        is collected when you register for our services and/or order our products.
    </p>
    <h3>Automatically Collected Non-Personal Information
    </h3>
    <p>
        Each time you visit one of our websites, your browser or Internet session automatically
        sends us certain types of non-personal information. This may include information
        about what browser or what type of computer you use, or information about your operating
        systems, Internet service provider, or IP address. Our system also automatically
        gathers information about which areas of our sites you visit and any links on our
        sites that you use to access other areas of the World Wide Web. We use such information
        in the aggregate to understand how our visitors use our websites and to make adjustments
        and improvements. If you would like to have your automatically collected information
        removed from TestMasters Websites, contact our administrative office. However, if
        you take our course, purchase our books, or register for any of our services, we
        will not remove your personal information from our student database, but we will
        not solicit you or use your information for any purpose other than record-keeping.
    </p>
    <h3>User Provided Personal Information
    </h3>
    <p>
        In addition to non-personal information automatically collected by your browser,

        communications. If you would like to have your user provided personal information
        removed from TestMasters Websites, contact our administrative office. However, if
        you take our course, purchase our books, or register for any of our services, we
        will not remove your personal information from our student database, but we will
        not solicit you or use your information for any purpose other than record-keeping.

        email address, educational background, year(s) of graduation, as well as unique
        identifiers, such as their social security numbers or student ID numbers. Contact
        information is utilized to contact our visitors if necessary. Unique identifiers
        are employed to verify the user’s identity prior to allowing visitor access
        to some of our online services. You can choose NOT provide personal information
        by NOT registering on our websites. While you will be able to access the public
        portion of our websites, you will not be able to access areas that require registration.

        Users must detail what information they would like to receive and provide TestMasters

    </p>
    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
            Data created by a web server that is stored on a user’s computer. It provides
            a way for the website to keep track of a user’s patterns and preferences and,
            with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user’s own hard
            disk. The cookies contain a range of URLs (Web addresses) for which they are valid.
            When the browser encounters those URLs again, it sends those specific cookies to
            the web server. You can avoid the use of cookies by having your browser disable
            cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your
            browser in the Options or Preferences menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>NOTE: If you disable cookies in your browser, you will not be able to access
                any of TestMasters’ secured websites.</strong>
        </p>
        <h4>IP (Internet Protocol) Address</h4>
        <p>
            This is the address of a computer attached to a TCP/IP network. Every client and
            server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a
            permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session.
            IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.64.2).
        </p>
        <h4>Browser Session</h4>
        <p>
            A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use.
            The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you
            reopen the browser, you begin a new session.
        </p>
        <h4>TLS Encryption (Transport Layer Security)</h4>
        <p>
            TLS Encryption is the leading security protocol on the Internet. When an TLS session
            is started, the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can
            securely send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data
            via secret key encryption during that session. We use TLS encryption during registration
            when you enter your credit card number or other personal information and during
            the creation of your login for the Online Resource Center when entering your social
            security number.
        </p>
        <h4>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h4>
        <p>
            URLs are Internet addresses. URLs are used to locate sites on the Internet and to
            navigate between sites and pages within sites. The URL for TestMasters is www.testmasters.net
