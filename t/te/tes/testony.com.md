5.3.
    In the context of a registration, we receive a user ID with the information under which the user with this user ID is logged in and an ID that cannot be further used by the Service Provider (so called “user handle”). Whether we receive further data depends only on the user who uses the authentication by a Third-party Provider, the data that is selected to be released in the context of the authentication, and which data has been authorized by the user in the privacy or other settings of the user account at the Third-party Provider. The data can differ, depending on the provider and the selections of the user; normally these are the e-mail address and the user name. In case of Facebook, this is also the - so called - Public Profile Information, that can be seen by everyone. This includes the name, profile and cover picture, gender, networks (i.e. school or working place), user name (Facebook URL) and user identification number (Facebook ID).

**Google Analytics and User ID**

10.1.
    We use Google Analytics, a Google Inc. („Google“) web analysis service. Google uses cookies, text files that are saved on users' computers and allow the use of our Service to be analyzed. The information generated on the user's use of our Service by the cookie is generally transferred to a Google server in the US where it is saved. 
10.2.
    We also use the function User ID in order to track data on user interaction with our Service. This User ID is anonymized and encrypted and will be except for its pseudonymous use not be processed with other data of a user in a way that makes the user identifiable. 
10.3.
    Google will use this information on our behalf in order to assess users' use of our Service, in order to compile reports on the activities within our Service and in order to render additional services for us associated with the use of our Service and Internet use. 
10.4.
    We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that Google shortens user IP addresses within an EU member state or in other contractual states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the US where it is shortened. 
10.5.
    We use the Analytics features for remarketing, Google Display Network impressions, DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration and Google Analytics reports on demographics and user interests. You can prevent Google from using Google Analytics for display ads and customize ads on the Google Display Network at: <https://www.google.com/settings/ads>. 
10.6.
    The IP address transferred by the user's browser is not linked to other Google data. Users can prevent cookies being saved through the appropriate setting on their browser software; users can also prevent the acquisition of the data generated by the cookie and related to the use of our Service in addition to the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the available browser plug-in at the following link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en). 
10.7.
    You can find further information on Google’s use of data for marketing purposes on the site map: <https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads>, Google’s privacy policy can be viewed at <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy>. If you wish to object to the collection of data by Google Marketing Services, you can use the settings and opt-out functions provided by Google: [http://www.google.com/ads/preferences](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences). 
11.
    

**Google Re/Marketing Services**

11.1.
     We use the marketing and remarketing services (hereinafter jointly referred to as the „Google Re/Marketing Services”) provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA („Google”). 
11.2.
    The Google Re/Marketing Services enable us to display ads for and on our Websites and Service in a more targeted manner so that users are only shown ads which might actually be of interest to them. Where users are, for example, shown ads for products in which they were interested on other websites, this is known as „remarketing”. For this purpose, as soon as the user accesses our Websites, or other websites on which Google Re/Marketing Services have been activated, Google immediately executes a Google code and so called re/marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also called Web Beacons) are integrated into the Website. With the help of these tags, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the users’ device (comparable technology can be used instead of cookies). The cookies can be set from various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. This file keeps a record of which websites the user visits, what content he/she is interested in and which offers he/she has clicked on, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of access and other details about the use of the website content. The users’ IP address is also recorded, whereby we, within the context of Google Analytics, would like to point out that, within member states of the European Union or in other countries that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, the IP address is truncated and only transmitted in its entirety to a Google server in the US and truncated there in exceptional cases. The IP address will not be linked with any of the user’s data from other services offered by Google. The aforementioned information can also be combined with equivalent information from other sources. If the user visits other websites afterwards, he/she can only be shown the ads that directly reflect his/her interests. 
11.3.
    Within the scope of Google Re/Marketing Services, the users’ data is processed pseudonymously. This means that Google does not, for example, store and process the users’ name or e-mail address, instead processing the relevant data on the basis of the cookies within pseudonymous user profiles. In other words, from Google’s point of view, the ads are managed and displayed for the cookie owner, regardless of who the cookie owner is, rather than for a specifically identified person. This shall not apply where the user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about the users via „DoubleClick” shall be transmitted to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the US. 
11.4.
    The online advertising program „Google AdWords” is just one of the Google Re/Marketing Services used by us. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer is given a different „conversion cookie”. This means that cookies cannot be tracked on the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained through the cookies serves to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. The AdWords customers find out the total number of users who have clicked on their ad and have been forwarded to a webpage into which a conversion tracking tag has been integrated. However, they do not receive any information that would allow users to be personally identified. 
11.5.
    On the basis of Google Re/Marketing Services, we integrate third-party „DoubleClick“ ads. DoubleClick uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to run ads based on users visiting this or other websites. 
11.6.
    On the basis of Google Re/Marketing Services, we also integrate third-party „AdSense“ ads. AdSense uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to run ads based on users visiting this or other websites. 
11.7.
    With the help of Google optimization services, we also test the user-friendliness and effectiveness of our Websites, e.g. by carrying out A/B tests, whereby users are shown different versions of Websites. 
11.8.
    Other Google Re/Marketing Services we use, are the „Campaign Manager” and the „Google Tag Manager”, which enable us to integrate other Google Analytics and Marketing Services into our Website (e.g. „AdWords”, „DoubleClick” or „Google Analytics”). 
11.9.
    You can find further information on Google’s use of data for marketing purposes on the site map: <https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads>, Google’s privacy policy can be viewed at <https://www.google.com/policies/privacy>. 
11.10.
    If you wish to object to the collection of data by Google Re/Marketing Services, you can use the settings and opt-out functions provided by Google: [http://www.google.com/ads/preferences](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences). 
12.
    

**General information on usage of Facebook**

12.1.
     **If the Service is carried out as a Facebook application and/or if authentication through Facebook is used, the permission of users is required for us to access their stored data on Facebook.**
12.2.
     **Users are expressly referred in the context of the Facebook consent dialog to this data collection and the data shared by Facebook with us (e.g. public profile, friends list, e-mail address and "Like" information) through the Service.**
12.3.
     **We may use the requested data anonymously for statistical purposes. I.e., if we may access the data on user's facebook chronic, posts or likes, we may evaluate how often a posting was shared or liked in order to help us improve our Services and its contents like our Quizzes and personality tests. We perform the evaluation anonymously, meaning independently of users' Personally Identifiable Data we received with the consent of the user (e.g. without the Facebook-ID). These evaluations are just for us only, without any transfers of this data to third parties.**
12.4.
     Users are referred to Facebook’s privacy policy <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-other> for more information about the consent process, consent granted and ways of revoking such consent within their Facebook profile.

13.
    

**Individual Content Adjustment**

13.1.
    **We use the information we receive on the user in order to adjust our Service and its contents with user’s demands, expectations or interests, whereby user profiles may be created. For this purpose, we use the data that we receive on users as described within this Privacy Policy and then analyze it via algorithmical functions.**
13.2.
    **This processed information includes data we receive from users during the registration procedure (e.g. a users’ gender, name or country), as well as the data we receive on a user’s use of our Service (e.g. which parts of our Service are preferably used, recommended, favored or shared with other users).**
14.
    

**Use of Facebook Social Plugins**

14.1.
    Our Service uses social plugins („plugins’) provided by the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or if you live in the European Union, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Irland („Facebook“). The plugins are usually identifiable by a Facebook logo (e.g. letter f on blue background or a thumb up icon). For a full list of all social Plugins please see <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/>. 
14.2.
    When you visit a page of our Service that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser that embeds the latter into the Service, enabling Facebook to receive information about you having accessed the respective page of our Service. Thus, we have no influence on the data gathered by the plugin and inform you according to our state of knowledge: The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our Service. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking „Like”, or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by it. Even if you are not logged into Facebook, there is possibility that the plugins transmit your IP-address to Facebook. 
14.3.
    For the information on the purpose and scope of data collection and procession by Facebook, as well as your rights in this respect and settings options for protecting your privacy please visit Facebook’s privacy policy: <https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/>. 
14.4.
    In case you want to opt out of being subject to Facebook's use of your data for marketing purposes please use Facebook's opt-out settings provided within your user profile: <https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads> or the opt-out possibilities on the websites <http://www.aboutads.info/choices> or for users from the EU [http://www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

**Image processing with FaceApp**

We use the services of the provider FaceApp (wireless lab OOO 16 Avtovskaya 401 Saint-Petersburg, 198096, Russia, https://www.faceapp.com, privacy policy: https://www.faceapp.com/privacy) to process photographs uploaded by users. FaceApp analyzes the photographs and edits them according to the functions selected by the users (e. g. prediction of how the person depicted will look in old age). 

The processing of the user's personal data resulting from the photograph is carried out by FaceApp for the sole purpose of the selected function. The photograph is only temporarily stored temporarily for this purpose and is then deleted within five days. Data other than the photograph will not be transmitted to FaceApp. The data is transmitted via an interface to FaceApp, so that FaceApp itself cannot collect any further user data (e. g. no IP address, cookies, etc.). 

With the use of Faceapp, users must agree to the processing of their data as described here in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, Art. 7 DSGVO. 

The use of the functions is only permitted for users who have reached the minimum age required for consent. The minimum age is generally 16 years (Art. 8 para. 1 DSGVO), but may be lower or higher in accordance with the regulations of individual countries. Users will be informed about the minimum age. In order to determine how high the legally permissible minimum age in the country from which the user uses our services, we can use the IP of the users to determine their location. This is done in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c of the DSGVO in order to fulfil our legal auditing and verification obligations of a permissible consent. 

The notice of objection and revocation as well as on the further user rights according to their citation at the end of this privacy policy apply.
