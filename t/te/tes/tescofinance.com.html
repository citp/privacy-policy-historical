	<p>Tesco Personal Finance cares about your privacy. This is our privacy policy, covering these parts of our websites:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Our homepage.</li>
		<li>Our product information pages.</li>
		<li>Our Smarter money pages.</li>
		<li>Our Security and Legal pages.</li>
		<li>Our Help pages.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Each of our online facilities, and any emails you receive from us, also contain information on how to opt-out of communications from us.</p>

	<p>Please note, this policy only applies to these parts of our websites. Other parts of our websites may have separate privacy policies.</p>

	<h2>About us</h2>
	<p>Tesco Personal Finance is a joint venture between the supermarket group, Tesco, and The Royal Bank of Scotland. A range of financial products is available, including loans, savings, credit cards and mortgages, as well as motor, home, life, pet and travel insurance.</p>

	<h2>What data we collect and why</h2>
	<p>When you visit our websites, we may collect data about you and about your visits to our websites. We collect data in three 'groups', which are explained below.</p>

	<h2 class="bluebg">1. Site Activity Tracking group</h2>
	<p>So that we can monitor the popularity of our websites, understand what pages visitors are looking at and how often visitors come to our site, and identify the source of new business, we collect data in web access logs and via cookies. Specifically, we collect the following information:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>HTTP protocol elements.</li>
		<li>Click-stream data.</li>
		<li>HTTP cookies.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This data is entirely anonymous, and doesn't identify individual users. This means that there is no reasonable way for us to identify the individual person this data was collected from.</p>

	<p>This data is used by ourselves, by our partner companies, and by companies that refer business to us.</p>

	<h2 class="bluebg">2. Technical Support group</h2>
	<p>We offer technical support facilities that allow visitors to send us details of problems they have experienced using our website or our Tesco Online Banking system. So that we can sensibly respond to queries, we collect the following information:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Name</li>
		<li>Home e-mail address</li>
		<li>Computer information</li>
		<li>Enquiry details</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Details of your problem (including computer configuration and possibly your Internet Service Provider) are collected to enable us to provide help or support. Your contact information is collected so that we can let you know if and when we have resolved the problem you reported.</p>

	<p>We only use your information internally; we don't share it with anyone else.</p>

	<h2 class="bluebg">3. Interactive Tools group</h2>
	<p>The "Smarter Money" section of our website, and some of the product information areas, offer interactive tools, such as calculators and quizzes. In order to make these work, data must be tracked against your current browser 'session'. We collect the following specific information:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Search terms</li>
		<li>Interactive data</li>
		<li>HTTP cookies</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We use the data only to allow you to use the interactive tools and make them work. We only use your information internally; we don't share it with anyone else. This data is entirely anonymous, and doesn't identify individual users. This means that there is no reasonable way for us to identify the individual person this data was collected from.</p>

	<h2>Cookies</h2>
	<p>"Cookies" are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which may then store them on your computer, and which enables the server to collect information from the browser. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can find out more about the way cookies work on <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com" title="This link opens in a new browser window" target="_blank">www.cookiecentral.com</a> (opens in a new browser window). Furthermore, computer viruses are not passed through the use of cookies. Our websites make use of cookies.</p>

	<p>Visitors to our websites are sent anonymous cookies to keep track of their browsing patterns and build up a demographic profile. In addition, any visitor who has clicked on a Tesco Personal Finance advertisement on another website that links to our websites will be sent a 'semi-persistent' (e.g. two weeks' lifetime) anonymous cookie that will allow us to analyse advertising effectiveness, identify the source of business referred to us, and manage our relationships with affiliate websites.</p>

	<p>We also use cookies to enable you to use and complete certain activities (like interactive tools in our Smarter Money section). Any visitor to one of those facilities will be sent a 'session' cookie (which lasts only for your visit) that enables you to use the facility.</p>

	<p>Whilst you do not need to allow your browser to accept cookies in order to browse much of our websites or to access many of our services, you must have cookies enabled if you wish to use some of our interactive tools or access any areas reserved for registered users (note, separate Privacy Policies apply to areas for registered users).</p>

	<p>Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. If you want to know how to do this, please look at the help menu on your browser. As described above, this will restrict the Tesco Personal Finance services you can use.</p>

	<h2>Accessing your data, and resolving disputes</h2>
	<p>We invite you to contact us if you have questions about this policy, or if you have a problem with the data that we hold about you, or if you think we have not followed our privacy policy in some way. You may contact our product areas by post or telephone. Check our <a href="../help/contact_us.html">Contact Us</a> page for the addresses and telephone numbers to contact.</p>

	<h2>Additional information</h2>
	<p>This policy is valid for a period of 3 months from today.</p>
