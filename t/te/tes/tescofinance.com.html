The website is owned and operated by Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco Bank, part of Tesco plc. This policy, together with our <a href="/security/site-terms.html" shape="rect">Site Terms of Use</a>, explains how Tesco Bank may use personal information we collect and hold about you, and your rights over its use. Please read this policy and our <a href="/security/site-terms.html" shape="rect">Terms of Use</a> carefully. If you are a customer of Tesco Bank, notices explaining how we use your information which are tailored to the individual products are included in your customer documentation.</p>
<p><strong>We may collect information from you when you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit the website, and other sites accessible from Tesco Bank.</li>
<li>Register with and buy products or services on the website.</li>
<li>Take part in promotions, competitions, customer surveys and questionnaires.</li>
<li>Contact us e.g. in writing or calling customer services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may supplement the information we collect about you with information we receive from other sources e.g. public registers such as the electoral roll. This allows us to assess the accuracy of the information we hold about you in order to send you relevant offers and information.</p>
<h3>Using your information</h3>
<p>Collecting your personal information helps Tesco Bank to better understand what you need from us so we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage and improve the website.</li>
<li>Personalise our services to you.</li>
<li>Administer and operate your account(s).</li>
<li>Process your orders and allocate Clubcard points to your account.</li>
<li>Tell you about important changes to the website and our services.</li>
<li>Understand your shopping behaviour to develop and improve our products and services.</li>
<li>Manage promotions, competitions, customer surveys and questionnaires.</li>
<li>Check and verify your identity, and prevent or detect crime. In performing checks your information may be disclosed to credit reference agencies, which may be kept on record.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share your personal information across the Tesco Group so it can provide you with relevant products and services.</p>
<p>Your personal information is safe with us and will never be released to external companies outside the Tesco Group for their marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We may use and share anonymous information about you outside the Tesco Group. However, we would like to reassure you that this never includes your personal information.</p>
<h3>Clubcard information</h3>
<p>We access the information recorded through the use of your Clubcard to help us improve our service to you and to make our communications more relevant.</p>
<h3>Marketing and research</h3>
<p>If you agree, we may contact you:</p>
<ul>
<li>with offers and information about Tesco Bank or partners' products or services</li>
<li>for customer research e.g. to help improve our services</li>
</ul>
<p>Prefer not to receive marketing information? Your choice – yet we'll be unable to tell you about great offers or promotions that may interest you.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<h4>What is a cookie?</h4>
<p>Cookies are text files containing information downloaded to your PC, mobile or other device when you visit a website. They are then sent back to the originating website per visit or to another website that recognises that cookie; this allows a website to recognise a user's device.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> - these remain on a user's device for a time period specified in the cookie. They are activated each time the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.</p>
<p><strong>Session cookies</strong> - these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. The session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily - once the browser is closed, all session cookies are deleted.</p>
<p>Cookies do many different jobs, like navigating between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and improving the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p>You can find more information about cookies at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" rel="external" shape="rect">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu" rel="external" shape="rect">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>
<h4>Cookies used on the website</h4>
<p>A list of the cookies used on the website by category is set out below.</p>
<h4>Strictly necessary cookies</h4>
<p>These cookies enable services you specifically ask for. For those types of cookies that are strictly necessary, no consent is required.</p>
<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, the services you ask for, such as shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.</p>
<h4>Performance cookies</h4>
<p>These cookies collect anonymous information on the pages visited.</p>
<p>They collect information about how visitors use the website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor - all information collected is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the website works.</p>
<h4>Functionality cookies</h4>
<p>These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience.</p>
<p>They allow the website to remember choices you made (such as your name, language or the region you're in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that can be customised. They may also be used to provide services you asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may not reveal the person’s identity and they cannot track browsing activity on other websites.</p>
<h4>Targeting or advertising cookies</h4>
<p>These collect information about browsing habits to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
<p>They are also used to limit the number of times an advertisement is seen as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. Usually placed by advertising networks, with our permission they remember visited websites. This information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.</p>
<h4>Behavioural advertising and online privacy</h4>
<p>A guide to behavioural advertising and online privacy has been produced by the internet advertising industry which can be found at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu" rel="external" shape="rect">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. The guide contains an explanation of the IAB's self-regulatory scheme to allow you greater control of the advertising you see.</p>
<h4>Using browser settings to manage cookies</h4>
<p>The help function on the menu bar of most browsers will inform you how to stop accepting new cookies, how they can notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable them altogether. Similar data can also be disabled or deleted as used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.</p>
<p>However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the website's essential features they can be left enabled. For example, if you block or otherwise reject cookies you may not be able to use our products, services and other facilities. If you leave cookies turned on, remember to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.</p>
<h3>Disclosing your information</h3>
<p>Your information will never be disclosed to anyone outside the Tesco Group except where your consent is granted; where we are required or permitted to do so by law; to other companies who provide a service to us; or any successors in title to our business.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area we will ensure that appropriate security measures are taken.</p>
<h3>Other websites</h3>
<p>The website may contain links to other sites which are outside our control and not covered by this policy. Operators of these sites may collect information from you that will be used by them in accordance with their policy, which may differ from ours.</p>
<h3>Accessing your information</h3>
