Using your information

### Using your information

We use your information (and information relating to joint applicants and other insured persons) to: 

  * provide our services to you;
  * work out financial and insurance risks by credit scoring;
  * understand our customers’ needs and requirements;
  * develop and test products and services;
  * carry out research and analysis about our products and services;
  * provide tailored information and offers about products and services that may be of interest to our customers;

  * prevent and detect crime.



We may use your information to contact you by phone or post and, if you provide us with an email address or mobile phone number, we may send you emails or text messages with operational messages about your application or account. As texts and emails can be intercepted, we will keep confidential information to a minimum and you should never send us any confidential information via text or email.

Sharing your information

### Sharing your information

We will only share your information: 

  * where we have your permission;
  * where we have to do so or where we’re allowed to do so by law;
  * for aggregated market research purposes where you will not be identifiable;
  * with regulatory bodies and authorities;
  * with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies for the purposes explained in this notice;
  * with panel insurers and other companies that help us to provide our services including companies that provide or may provide funding or services to us or help us recover debt; and
  * with other lenders or companies to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and obligations under our agreement with you.



We may also share your information with Tesco in connection with the operations of your Tesco Clubcard account, for example to allocate points or discounts, or where you have agreed to receive marketing, but we don’t share more information than we need to. 

Holding your information

### Holding your information

#### What sort of information do you hold about me?

We collect and retain your information when you access our website, complete an application or request a quotation either directly from us or via a price comparison website or provide information to us over the phone. We also retain information about your accounts and policies, including transactions and payments you make and receive. 

We may supplement the information we hold about you with information from third parties such as the wider Tesco group, credit reference agencies and publicly available sources to perform checks, assess the accuracy of the information we hold about you and provide you with relevant offers. 

We monitor and record calls to and from our customer service centres to improve our service and to prevent and detect fraud. 

If you contact us electronically (eg by email or Internet), we may collect your electronic identifier such as your internet protocol address. When you visit our website, we collect information about your browsing habits using cookies. 

#### What about joint applicants and insured persons?

We will retain and use information relating to joint applicants or insured persons that you provide to us. If you are a joint applicant or wish to provide us with details of other insured persons, you must ensure that you have the permission of the other party before: 

  * revealing information to us about them; and
  * authorising us to search, link or record information at credit reference agencies about them.



#### What about sensitive personal data?

We may occasionally process data which the Data Protection Act 1998 defines as “sensitive personal data” where necessary, for example where you tell us that you have medical condition which requires special treatment or where we have to process information relating to criminal convictions in connection with your insurance policy. You will be asked to consent to our use of data when you take out the relevant product or provide the information.

Sending your information to other countries

### Sending your information to other countries

We might send your information to other countries, for example where our service provider has a data centre overseas, but only when we can be sure your information will be adequately protected. Your information may be accessed by law enforcement agencies and other authorities. They do this to prevent and detect crime, or to comply with other legal obligations. 

How long we keep your information

### How long we keep your information

We keep your information for as long as we need to for legitimate business purposes and for legal and regulatory reasons. We will retain your information after your account has closed or policy has lapsed for these purposes and where you make an application but do not go on to take out the product. 

If we change how your information is used

### If we change how your information is used

We might change how your information is used from time to time. If we think you would not expect this change, we will write and tell you about it. If we don’t hear from you within 60 days, we’ll assume you agree to the change. 

Credit scoring

### Credit scoring

Credit scoring is an automated system which is used to assess your application and make decisions about your account. It calculates your likelihood of repaying the amount you intend to borrow. 

We take the information you provide in your application, information from third parties such as credit reference agencies and information we already hold about you in connection with other Tesco Bank products and, in some cases, information held by the wider Tesco group, including Tesco Clubcard transactions.

Credit reference agencies

### Credit reference agencies

We occasionally make searches at credit reference agencies. We access details about how you manage your accounts, including your account balances, credit limits and any arrears. This helps us manage and make decisions about your account with us and other products you may be eligible for. We may also send information to credit reference agencies – they can make this information available to other organisations to help them make decisions about you, your associates and members of your household. Depending on your financial position, this could affect your ability to obtain credit. The information might also be used for tracing purposes.

Credit reference agencies record any links between you and anyone with whom you have a joint account or similar financial association. All parties’ information will be taken into account in future applications. This happens until one of you successfully files a ‘notice of disassociation’ at the credit reference agencies. 

Fraud prevention agencies

### Fraud prevention agencies

Information provided in applications may be shared with fraud prevention agencies. This information may be accessed and used by law enforcement agencies. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when: 

  * checking applications for credit and other facilities and recovering debt;
  * managing credit and other facilities;
  * checking insurance applications and claims; and
  * checking details of job applicants and employees.



We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies. If you want a copy of the information held about you by credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies, we can give you their contact details if you write to us. 

They might charge you a fee.

Our panel insurers

### Our panel insurers

Our insurance products are offered in conjunction with our panel insurers. References to “we” in this section of the privacy policy refer to us and our panel insurers.

Credit Reference Agencies

### Credit Reference Agencies

To provide you with quotations or to assess your insurance application and the terms on which cover may be offered, and to process claims and maintain your policy during the period of insurance and at renewal, we may obtain information about you, all drivers named on your policy and any person who may be paying your premiums from third parties such as credit reference agencies (including publicly available data, previous searches and the full electoral register). 

The agencies may record our enquiries. This will not affect your credit rating. 

Fraud Prevention Agencies

### Fraud Prevention Agencies

We and our panel insurers may share your information with the Claims and Underwriting Exchange register, run by the Insurance Database Service Limited (IDS Ltd) and other similar databases or fraud prevention agencies established for the same purpose. 

The aim is to help us check information that is given to us and to prevent or detect crime, including fraud. When we process your request for insurance cover or when you make a claim, we may search these registers.

If you give inaccurate details or fraud is suspected this may be shared with fraud prevention agencies, and may also be used by other organisations to make decisions about you and others in your household on credit, insurance (including claims), debt tracing, and to prevent crime. If such companies suspect fraud, we will share your relevant personal information with them.

We and our panel insurers may research, collect and use data about you from publicly available sources, including social media and networking sites. We and our panel insurers may use this data for the purposes of fraud detection or prevention.

Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident, whether or not you think it is likely to give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to that incident to these registers.

Tesco Clubcard information

### Tesco Clubcard information

Clubcard information is one of a number of factors that we take into account when assessing credit risk. For example, we will take Clubcard information linked to your household into account when considering your application for some of our banking products. We use Clubcard information to evaluate your eligibility for credit products, as part of the assessment we are required to do. 

For some of our insurance products, we use the information you provide, including name and address, to find a Clubcard number linked to your household. Tesco Stores Limited make this Clubcard information (including information about purchases when you or a household member use your Clubcard) available to us to enable us to generate a risk score for your household, which is used to calculate the level of Clubcard discount Tesco Bank and its insurers may offer you. The risk score may be shared with our select panel of insurers in order for any discount to be applied. Tesco Bank does not share Clubcard information with its insurers. Clubcard information is used in this way whenever you are given a quote, including at renewal and if you make any changes to your policy. 

For these banking and insurance products, Clubcard information is always used to have a positive impact on your application for a banking product or to provide a discount on your insurance premium. We explain during our application and quotation processes when we will use Clubcard information in this way.

We also use Clubcard information and information about your online behaviour collected through Tesco group websites to improve our service and make our marketing communications more relevant to you.

Sending marketing information

### Sending marketing information

We will send you tailored marketing information by post, telephone, text and email, but only if you have agreed to receive marketing information via these channels. We only send you information about products that we think you would like to hear about. 

We may contact you if you abandon or fail to complete an online quotation or application to see if we can offer you any assistance with this.

We may provide you with tailored marketing information through other channels such as at tills when you shop in Tesco, but only where you are opted into receive marketing communications. 

We may also display tailored online advertising on third party websites, such as social media sites, sites operated by internet service providers and sites which sell advertising space.

We may use the information that we hold about you to personalise the advertisements to you. Where we display personalised advertisements on third party sites, we display the Ad Choices logo which you can click on for further information about online behavioural advertising. 

For sites you have subscribed to, such as social media sites and email providers the terms and conditions and privacy policy for that site will explain how advertisements are displayed.
