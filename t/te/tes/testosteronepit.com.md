# Privacy Policy | Wolf Street

### **Who we are**

We are Wolf Street Corp and publish a finance, business, and economics website. Our website address is: https://wolfstreet.com.

### **What personal data we collect and why we collect it**

Reading this site is free, and you do not need to sign in to read it. However, there are two functions that only work if you provide some data:

  1. When you leave comments on the site, we collect the data you put into the comments form, and also your IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. **To avoid revealing your name, you’re encouraged to sign in with an alias and an anonymous or even a fake email address.**  To enable easy repeat commenting, this site recognizes you by your email (fake email is ok).
  2. When you sign up for our email updates, which are free, we collect the email address you enter into the signup box. For you to receive the email updates, the email address must be functional. We do not ask for a name.



### **Cookies**

If you leave a comment on our site, the site places cookies in your browser. These are for the proper functioning of the comment page and for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

This site uses third-party advertisers that use cookies to gather user information across the Internet and serve up personalized ads.

You can disable cookies in your browser. If you do, this site will function properly, except for the commenting page. You can also delete cookies in your browser. For more information on how to block cookies or manage them in other ways, please see: <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/>

### **Embedded content from other websites**

Articles on this site may occasionally include embedded content (e.g. videos, tweets, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor were visiting the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### **Links to Third-Party Websites**

This site uses numerous links to government websites, news media sites, data providers, and many others. These links are essential in blogging to source the data or the quoted text, among other reasons. If you click on any of these links, it will take you to that website (third-party website). This site also uses ads that, when you click on them, will take you to a third-party website. We have no control over these third-party websites. They have their own privacy practices and policies.

### **Analytics**

The site uses a third-party service, Google Analytics, that measures and analyzes web traffic and provides essential analytical data, for example, pageviews per day, percentage of visitors located in a certain country, and type of device and operating system used to access this site. These analytical services use cookies and other technologies to collect the data. You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by the process on Google’s website:  
<https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>

### **Who we share your data with**

If you signed up for our email updates, we share your email address with the service provider that handles our email updates. We currently use MailChimp for this service. MailChimp has its own privacy policy which you can read here: <https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/>

If you post comments, your data is shared with WordPress, whose comments platform we use, and WordPress does not share this information with anyone.

### **How long we retain your data**

If you leave a comment, the comment itself and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

### **Where we send your data**

This site is hosted on a server in the United States, and all data that we control is kept on this server. Data that is sent to third parties is hosted by those third parties, and we have no control over them. Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

### **How we protect your data**

This site is encrypted and has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.
