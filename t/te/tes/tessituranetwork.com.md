# Privacy Policy

At Tessitura Network (“Tessitura”, “Network”, “we” or “us”), we respect and protect your privacy rights. This Privacy Policy describes:

  * When and what information we collect on our websites and through use of our online services (the "Services"), or by any of our service providers through our website.
  * How we use Personal Information we collect.
  * Your rights regarding your Personal Information.



This Policy describes Network's practices regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information. "Personal Information" is information through which you can be directly or indirectly identified, e.g. your name, your e-mail address and items you purchased (provided we can connect them to your e-mail/customer account) "Individual Customers" refers to licensees/members of Tessitura software and their designated employees.

By using this website or our products and services, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy. Tessitura has agreements (the “Agreements”) with Individual Customers that contain other provisions with respect to Personal Information. 

The terms and conditions of the Agreements are in addition to this Privacy Policy and take precedence over this Privacy Policy in the event of any conflict. This includes, without limitation, the terms of our Data Processing Agreement for those Individual Customers for whom Tessitura performs data processing. 

### Use of Personal Information

The information that we collect from Individual Customers is used for licensing Tessitura software and supporting Tessitura Network members in their use of that software, managing transactions, reporting, invoicing, renewals, and other operations related to providing services and products to the Individual Customer.

When we host Tessitura software on behalf of a licensee/member, Tessitura Network serves as a service provider. In our capacity as a service provider, we will receive, store, and/or process Personal Information. In such cases, we are acting as a data processor and will process the Personal Information on behalf of and under the direction of our Individual Customers. The information that we store for our Individual Customers in this capacity is controlled by Individual Customers for managing transactions, reporting, invoicing, renewals, other operations related to providing services to their customers. Tessitura Network uses Personal Information that it collects directly from its Individual Customers and for its partners indirectly in its role as a service provider for the following business purposes, without limitation:

  * maintaining and supporting its products, delivering and providing the requested products/services, and complying with its contractual obligations related thereto (including managing transactions, reporting, invoices, renewals, and other operations related to providing services to an Individual Customer);
  * satisfying governmental reporting, tax, and other requirements (e.g., import/export);
  * storing and processing data, including Personal Information, in computer databases and servers located in the United States, Europe, and Australia;
  * verifying identity (e.g., for online access to accounts), as requested by the Individual Customer;
  * for other business-related purposes permitted or required under applicable local law and regulation;
  * to protect the security or integrity of our websites and our business
  * and as otherwise required by law.



### Disclosures and Onward Transfers of Personal Information of Individual Customers

Tessitura Network never discloses or sells Personal Information to Third Parties, except as expressly set forth herein.

Unless an Agreement provides otherwise, we will only disclose personally identifiable information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy:

  * To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
  * To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.
  * For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
  * With your consent.



We may share your Personal Information where necessary in order to comply with any legal obligation, legal requests by public authorities, including requests to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to protect and defend us, our subsidiaries and affiliates and all of our officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, and partners, in connection with any legal action, claim or dispute or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements.

We may transfer your Personal Information to a third party in the event of a transfer of all or some of our assets to a third party, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to terms similar to those of this Privacy Policy. We will provide you with an opportunity to reject the transfer of your Personal Information in such cases.

We may disclose aggregated, non-personal information about website users without restriction.

###  Retention

We will keep your Personal Information for as long as necessary for the purposes described herein or as long as we are required by law. After this your Personal Information will be deleted. We cannot remove your Personal Information when there is a legal storage requirement, such as accounting rules or when there are other legal grounds to keep the data, such as an ongoing contractual relationship.

###  Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. Accordingly, while no set of privacy and security standards or safeguards is 100% secure, we take steps to ensure any information that you share with us is kept secure and strictly confidential in accordance with this policy. We take various precautions to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, alteration, destruction or similar risks. Tessitura Network personnel may access and use Personal Information only if they are authorized to do so and only for the purpose for which they are authorized.

### California Residents

Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with Network may make a written request to Network about how we have shared their Personal Information with third parties for direct marketing purposes during the prior calendar year. In response to a written request, Network is allowed to provide a cost-free means to opt-out of such sharing.

Network does not share your Personal Information with third parties for direct marketing purposes and therefore is not required to provide such a procedure; however, if you would like to access, correct or request deletion of your Personal Information in Network’s possession please follow the cost-free procedures set forth herein.
