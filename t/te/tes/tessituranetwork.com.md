_PRIVACY PRINCIPLES_ :  The privacy principles listed below are based on the Safe Harbor Principles.

_NOTICE_ : Where Tessitura collects personal information directly from individuals in the EEA, Tessitura does not use or disclose the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected nor does Tessitura disclose information to any third party other than subcontractors of Tessitura Network, Inc. who are bound to the same obligations of confidentiality.  Where Tessitura provides data processing services to members through our RAMP or RADR programs, Tessitura acts only as a processor of the data and not the data collector.  Such data collectors are required to comply with all applicable EU Member State Data Protection regime, thereby ensuring the data subjects have been provided with proper notice regarding how their personal data will be used.

_CHOICE_ : As stated above, Tessitura does not use or disclose personal information to any third party.  For purposes of these standards, opt-out is the default and only choice.

_DATA INTEGRITY_ : Tessitura will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Tessitura will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. We will only collect and store personal information that is relevant to fulfill the purpose of the request and will retain such information no longer than appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the request.

_TRANSFERS TO AGENTS or THIRD PARTIES_ : Tessitura will not transfer personal information to any third party.

_ACCESS AND CORRECTION_ : Upon request, Tessitura will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, Tessitura will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. 

_SECURITY_ : Tessitura will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

_ENFORCEMENT_ : Tessitura will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Policy. Any employee that Tessitura determines to have intentionally violated this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

_DISPUTE RESOLUTION_ : Any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of personal information should be directed to the address given below. Tessitura will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this Policy. For complaints that cannot be resolved between Tessitura and the complainant, Tessitura has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the American Arbitration Association pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles.

_LIMITATIONS ON APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES_ :  Adherence by Tessitura to these Safe Harbor Principles may be limited (a) to the extent required or permitted by law or legal process, such as to respond to or investigate a legal or ethical obligation or request or pursuant to court orders, subpoenas, interrogatories or similar directive carrying the force of law; and (b) to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation.
