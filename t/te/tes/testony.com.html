<dl>
<dt>3.1.</dt>
<dd>We will process personally identifiable data within the scope of the law and not without your required
further consent only to the extent necessary for the conclusion and execution of our contractual
relationship.
</dd>
<dt>3.2.</dt>
<dd>We take organizational, contractual and technical security measures to ensure that the provisions of
data privacy laws are complied with and, as a result, the data managed by us is protected from
accidental or intentional manipulations, loss, destruction or access by unauthorized persons. These
security measures are monitored on a regular basis and updated according to industry standard as
necessary.
</dd>
<dt>3.3.</dt>
<dd>If, within the framework of this Privacy Policy, contents, tools or other means and mediums are used by
other providers (hereinafter referred to collectively as “Third-party Providers”) and whose registered
office is abroad, it is assumed that a data transfer to the countries where those registered offices of
the Third-party Providers are located takes place. The transmission of data to third-party countries is
either based on legal authorization, user consent or specific clauses in the contract, which provide for
legally required data security.

<dd><p><strong>Registration through authentication services of third parties</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>5.1.</dt>
<dd>Users can register and log in by using authentication services of Third-party Providers, as far as these
are available (hereinafter referred to as „authentication by a third-party“). Particularly Facebook,
Google or Twitter can be possible authentication service providers.
</dd>
<dt>5.2.</dt>
<dd>As requirement for the authentication through a Third-party Provider, users should be registered at the
respective Third-party Provider and enter the necessary login details in the appropriate web formula or
should be already logged in to the Third-party Provider.
</dd>
<dt>5.3.</dt>
<dd>In the context of a registration, we receive a user ID with the information under which the user with
this user ID is logged in and an ID that cannot be further used by the Service Provider (so called “user
handle”). Whether we receive further data depends only on the user who uses the authentication by a
Third-party Provider, the data that is selected to be released in the context of the authentication, and
which data has been authorized by the user in the privacy or other settings of the user account at the
Third-party Provider. The data can differ, depending on the provider and the selections of the user;
normally these are the e-mail address and the user name. In case of Facebook, this is also the - so
called - Public Profile Information, that can be seen by everyone. This includes the name, profile and
cover picture, gender, networks (i.e. school or working place), user name (Facebook URL) and user
identification number (Facebook ID).
</dd>
<dt>5.4.</dt>
<dd>The password that has been entered in the context of the authentication by a Third-party Provider cannot
be seen by us, neither can it be saved by the Service Provider.
</dd>
<dt>5.5.</dt>
<dd>The users are asked to keep in mind that their data, which we save, can be compared and synchronized
with their user account at the Third-party Provider automatically. There is no obligation however for us
to update the data.
</dd>
<dt>5.6.</dt>
<dd>In the case that users decide that they do not wish to further use the connection of their user account
at the Third-party Provider for the authentication by a Third-party Provider, they must cancel this
connection within their user account at the Third-party Provider. If the users wish to delete their data
we save, they must cancel their account at our Service.
</dd>
<dt>5.7.</dt>
<dd>During the use of authentication by a third party, the users are asked to keep in mind the applicable
Terms of Use, as well as the Rules for Data Use of the third party. These can be found: Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/tos" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/tos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>), Google (<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/</a>),

provided by OneSignal Inc., 201 San Antonio Rd #140, Mountain View, CA 94040, USA.
</dd>
<dt>9.2.</dt>
<dd>The push notifications are set up with the users’ consent and the users’ browser must support such push

<a id="10"></a>

<dd><p><strong>Google Analytics and User ID</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>10.1.</dt>
<dd>We use Google Analytics, a Google Inc. („Google“) web analysis service. Google uses cookies, text files
that are saved on users' computers and allow the use of our Service to be analyzed. The information
generated on the user's use of our Service by the cookie is generally transferred to a Google server in
the US where it is saved.
</dd>
<dt>10.2.</dt>
<dd>We also use the function User ID in order to track data on user interaction with our Service. This User
ID is anonymized and encrypted and will be except for its pseudonymous use not be processed with other
data of a user in a way that makes the user identifiable.
</dd>
<dt>10.3.</dt>
<dd>Google will use this information on our behalf in order to assess users' use of our Service, in order to
compile reports on the activities within our Service and in order to render additional services for us
associated with the use of our Service and Internet use.
</dd>
<dt>10.4.</dt>
<dd>We only use Google Analytics with activated IP anonymization. This means that Google shortens user
IP addresses within an EU member state or in other contractual states of the Agreement on the European
Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a Google server in the US
where it is shortened.
</dd>
<dt>10.5.</dt>
<dd>We use the Analytics features for remarketing, Google Display Network impressions, DoubleClick Campaign
Manager integration and Google Analytics reports on demographics and user interests. You can prevent
Google from using Google Analytics for display ads and customize ads on the Google Display Network at:
<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>.
</dd>
<dt>10.6.</dt>
<dd>The IP address transferred by the user's browser is not linked to other Google data. Users can prevent
cookies being saved through the appropriate setting on their browser software; users can also prevent
the acquisition of the data generated by the cookie and related to the use of our Service in addition to

<dd><p><strong>Google Re/Marketing Services</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>11.1.</dt>
<dd>
We use the marketing and remarketing services (hereinafter jointly referred to as the „Google
Re/Marketing Services”) provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA
(„Google”).
</dd>
<dt>11.2.</dt>
<dd>The Google Re/Marketing Services enable us to display ads for and on our Websites and Service in a more
targeted manner so that users are only shown ads which might actually be of interest to them. Where
users are, for example, shown ads for products in which they were interested on other websites, this is
known as „remarketing”. For this purpose, as soon as the user accesses our Websites, or other websites
on which Google Re/Marketing Services have been activated, Google immediately executes a Google code and
so called re/marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also called Web Beacons) are integrated into
the Website. With the help of these tags, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the
users’ device (comparable technology can be used instead of cookies). The cookies can be set from
various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com,
googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. This file keeps a record of which websites the user
visits, what content he/she is interested in and which offers he/she has clicked on, as well as
technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of access and
other details about the use of the website content. The users’ IP address is also recorded, whereby we,
within the context of Google Analytics, would like to point out that, within member states of the
European Union or in other countries that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, the
IP address is truncated and only transmitted in its entirety to a Google server in the US and truncated
there in exceptional cases. The IP address will not be linked with any of the user’s data from other
services offered by Google. The aforementioned information can also be combined with equivalent
information from other sources. If the user visits other websites afterwards, he/she can only be shown
the ads that directly reflect his/her interests.
</dd>
<dt>11.3.</dt>
<dd>Within the scope of Google Re/Marketing Services, the users’ data is processed pseudonymously. This
means that Google does not, for example, store and process the users’ name or e-mail address, instead
processing the relevant data on the basis of the cookies within pseudonymous user profiles. In other
words, from Google’s point of view, the ads are managed and displayed for the cookie owner, regardless
of who the cookie owner is, rather than for a specifically identified person. This shall not apply where
the user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The
information collected about the users via „DoubleClick” shall be transmitted to Google and stored on
Google’s servers in the US.
</dd>
<dt>11.4.</dt>
<dd>The online advertising program „Google AdWords” is just one of the Google Re/Marketing Services used by
us. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer is given a different „conversion cookie”. This
means that cookies cannot be tracked on the websites of AdWords customers. The information obtained
through the cookies serves to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for
conversion tracking. The AdWords customers find out the total number of users who have clicked on their
ad and have been forwarded to a webpage into which a conversion tracking tag has been integrated.
However, they do not receive any information that would allow users to be personally identified.
</dd>
<dt>11.5.</dt>
<dd>On the basis of Google Re/Marketing Services, we integrate third-party „DoubleClick“ ads. DoubleClick
uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to run ads based on users visiting this or
other websites.
</dd>
<dt>11.6.</dt>
<dd>On the basis of Google Re/Marketing Services, we also integrate third-party „AdSense“ ads. AdSense uses
cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to run ads based on users visiting this or other
websites.
</dd>
<dt>11.7.</dt>
<dd>With the help of Google optimization services, we also test the user-friendliness and effectiveness of
our Websites, e.g. by carrying out A/B tests, whereby users are shown different versions of Websites.
</dd>
<dt>11.8.</dt>
<dd>Other Google Re/Marketing Services we use, are the „Campaign Manager” and the „Google Tag Manager”,
which enable us to integrate other Google Analytics and Marketing Services into our Website (e.g.
„AdWords”, „DoubleClick” or „Google Analytics”).

We use the services of the provider FaceApp (wireless lab OOO 16 Avtovskaya 401 Saint-Petersburg, 198096, Russia, https://www.faceapp.com, privacy policy: https://www.faceapp.com/privacy) to process photographs uploaded by users. FaceApp analyzes the photographs and edits them according to the functions selected by the users (e. g. prediction of how the person depicted will look in old age).
<br><br>
The processing of the user's personal data resulting from the photograph is carried out by FaceApp for the sole purpose of the selected function. The photograph is only temporarily stored temporarily for this purpose and is then deleted within five days. Data other than the photograph will not be transmitted to FaceApp. The data is transmitted via an interface to FaceApp, so that FaceApp itself cannot collect any further user data (e. g. no IP address, cookies, etc.).
<br><br>
With the use of Faceapp, users must agree to the processing of their data as described here in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, Art. 7 DSGVO.
<br><br>
The use of the functions is only permitted for users who have reached the minimum age required for consent. The minimum age is generally 16 years (Art. 8 para. 1 DSGVO), but may be lower or higher in accordance with the regulations of individual countries. Users will be informed about the minimum age. In order to determine how high the legally permissible minimum age in the country from which the user uses our services, we can use the IP of the users to determine their location. This is done in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c of the DSGVO in order to fulfil our legal auditing and verification obligations of a permissible consent.

The notice of objection and revocation as well as on the further user rights according to their citation at the end of this privacy policy apply.
