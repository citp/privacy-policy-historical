# Privacy and cookies Policy- Tesco.ie

We use cookies to give you the best possible experience on our site. By continuing to use the site you agree to our use of cookies. [Find out more.](https://www.tesco.ie/help/privacy-and-cookies/)

Last Updated: 8 March 2018

At Tesco, we're working hard to serve shoppers a little better every day. Looking after the personal data you share with us is a hugely important part of this. We want you to be confident that your data is safe and secure with us, and understand how we use it to offer you a better and more personalised shopping experience.

    

**The data controller is Tesco Ireland Limited (referred to in this policy as "we" or "us").**

We are committed to doing the right thing when it comes to how we collect, use and protect your personal data. That's why we've developed this privacy and cookies policy ("Policy"), which:

  * sets out the types of personal data that we collect
  * explains how and why we collect and use your personal data
  * explains when and why we will share personal data within the Tesco Group and with other organisations; and
  * explains the rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data



We offer a wide range of products and services, so we want you to be clear about what this Policy covers. This Policy applies to you if you use our services (referred to in this Policy as "our Services"). Using our Services means:

  * shopping with us over the phone, or online or otherwise using any of the websites ("our Websites") or mobile applications ("our Mobile Apps") where this Policy is posted; or
  * being a member of the Clubcard loyalty scheme ("Clubcard")



This Policy also applies if you contact us or we contact you about our Services.

Some other parts of our business and other Tesco Group companies may need to collect and use personal data to provide you with their products and services and for certain other purposes. They have their own privacy policies that explain how they use your personal data.

Our Websites or Mobile Apps may contain links to other websites operated by other organisations that have their own privacy policies. Please make sure you read the terms and conditions and privacy policy carefully before providing any personal data on a website as we do not accept any responsibility or liability for websites of other organisations.
