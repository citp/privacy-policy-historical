# Tesco – Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 23 May 2018

At Tesco, we’re working hard to serve shoppers a little better every day. Looking after the personal data you share with us is a hugely important part of this. We want you to be confident that your data is safe and secure with us, and understand how we use it to offer you a better and more personalised shopping experience.

**Thedata controller is Tesco Stores Limited (referred to in this policy as “we” or “us”).**

We are committed to doing the right thing when it comes to how we collect, use and protect your personal data. That’s why we’ve developed this privacy and cookies policy (“Policy”), which:

  * sets out the types of personal data that we collect
  * explains how and why we collect and use your personal data
  * explains when and why we will share personal data within the [Tesco Group](https://www.tescoplc.com/about-us/our-businesses/tesco-uk/tesco-in-the-uk/) and with other organisations; and
  * explains the rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data



We offer a wide range of products and services, so we want you to be clear about what this Policy covers. This Policy applies to you if you use our services (referred to in this Policy as “our Services”). Using our Services means:

Parts of this Policy also apply if you use our in store pharmacy services.

Parts of this Policy also apply to our store CCTV systems where they capture footage of you.

Some other parts of our business and other Tesco Group companies may need to collect and use personal data to provide you with their products and services and for certain other purposes. They have their own privacy policies that explain how they use your personal data.

Our Websites or Mobile Apps may contain links to other websites operated by other organisations that have their own privacy policies.

  * to test and develop new products and services as well as improve existing ones. 



**This section explains how and why we share personal data with other companies within the Tesco Group.**

We may share the personal data we collect with other companies in the Tesco Group. For example, we share personal data with the following Tesco Group companies.

### Tesco Bank

Tesco Bank use your Clubcard data to help them work out whether they can offer you certain products, and what discounts, deals or offers they can make you.

Tesco Bank may use data that you provide, such as your name and address, to find any Clubcard(s) that are linked to your address.  They may use data about these Clubcard(s) to help tailor offers to you. When they do this, they will only ever use the Clubcard linked to your address which gives you the best terms, deals or offers.

Tesco Bank may look at your Clubcard data in different ways to help understand more about you (we call this ‘profiling’). Profiling includes things such as how likely Tesco Bank think you are to pay back money they lend you, how often you use other Tesco products and services, and how you prefer to shop. Profiling helps Tesco Bank create a number of ‘Clubcard scores’, which they then use as one of the factors in their automated decision-making process.

Where applicable, at the point of applying, individual offers you receive may be affected by your credit rating. Tesco Bank may also take into account whether or not you are a Clubcard customer.

Profiling allows Tesco Bank to tailor offers specifically to its customers. This means that different Clubcard customers may get different offers. For its banking products profiling means that customers will receive better offers and/or be more likely to be accepted for the product requested than non-Clubcard customers who have a broadly equivalent credit rating.

Where Tesco Bank are offering insurance products, Clubcard profiling means that although different Clubcard customers may get different offers, Clubcard customers will always receive better offers than non Clubcard customers.

We make Clubcard information (including information about purchases when you use your Clubcard) and information about your online behaviour we have collected through cookies available to Tesco Bank.  This helps them to improve their service and make their marketing communications more relevant to you.

We may also use data provided to us by Tesco Bank, for example information about the Tesco Bank products you hold, to improve our service and make our marketing communications more relevant to you.

You can find more information about the way in which Tesco Bank use your data in their [privacy and cookies policy](http://www.tescobank.com/help/privacy-and-cookies/).

### Tesco Mobile

We make Clubcard information (including information about purchases when you use your Clubcard) and information about your online behaviour we have collected through cookies available to Tesco Mobile. This helps them to improve their service and make their marketing communications more relevant to you.

You can find more information about the way in which Tesco Mobile use your data in their [privacy and cookies policy](http://www.tescomobile.com/about-us/terms-and-conditions/general/privacy-and-cookies-policy).

### dunnhumby

dunnhumby, part of the Tesco Group, is also one of our main service providers. dunnhumby help us to use personal data to help improve our understanding of customers and personalise your customer experience. You can find out more about what dunnhumby do [here](https://www.dunnhumby.com/).

**This section explains how and why we share personal data with Retail Partners and Service Providers.**

When we share personal data with these companies we require them to keep it safe, and they must not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes.

### Retail partners

We work with a number of Retail Partners who:

  * sell products through our services; or
  * offer products, services and/or the ability to earn points through Clubcard.



We only share personal data that enable our Retail Partners to provide their services.

### Service Providers

We work with carefully selected Service Providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf. These include, for example, companies that help us with technology services, storing, combining and analyzing data, processing payments, provide us with legal or other professional services as well as delivering orders. We only share personal data that enable our Service Providers to provide their services.

Some of the Service Providers we work with operate online media channels, and they place relevant online advertising for our products and services, as well as those of our suppliers and our Retail Partners, on those online media channels on our behalf. For example, you may see an advert for our products and services as you use a particular social media site or watch television through your pay TV account.

Examples of our Service Providers include Facebook, Adobe, Dunnhumby and WorldPay.

**_This section explains how and why we share personal data with other organisations._**

We may share personal data with other organisations in the following circumstances:

  * if the law or a public authority says we must share the personal data or for the administration of justice;
  * if we need to share personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (this includes providing personal data to others for the purposes of preventing fraud);
  * where we restructure, sell or transfer our business (or a part of it). For example in connection with a takeover or merger.



**We know how important it is to protect and manage your personal data. This section sets out some of the measures we have in place.**

  * We apply physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal data;
  * We protect the security of your information while it is being transmitted by encrypting it;
  * We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption to keep this data safe;
  * We only authorise access to employees and trusted partners who need it to carry out their responsibilities;

It may also be processed by companies operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our service providers. If we do this we ensure that your privacy rights are respected in line with this Policy. The most common way we do this is to put in place a specific type of contract, a copy of this type of contract can be found [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm) or through an approved scheme such as the [Privacy Shield](https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome).

**We will not keep your personal data longer than we need to, how long this is depends on several factors, including:**

  * Why we collected it in the first place;
  * How old it is;
  * Whether there is a legal/regulatory reason for us to keep it;
  * Whether we need it to protect you or us.



**_This section explains the choices you have when it comes to receiving marketing communications and taking part in market research._**

We will send you relevant offers and news about our products and services in a number of ways including by email, but only if you have previously agreed to receive these marketing communications. When you register with us we will ask if you would like to receive marketing communications, and you can change your marketing choices at anytime online, by clicking the unsubscribe link in the footer of any marketing email, over the phone or in writing.

We also like to hear your views to help us to improve our Services, so we may contact you for market research purposes. You always have the choice about whether to take part in our market research.
