###  4\. Personal information that we share with third parties 

In order to provide the services offered on our Sites, we sometimes need to share your personal information with other companies in the Tes group. However, we will continue to be responsible for the usage and security of your personal information when this happens. 

_**Tes' data processors**_

We may also share your personal information with third party processors or suppliers that we engage to provide services to us and/or support our offering to you (such as our hosting, database and marekting platform providers). These third parties may need to process your personal information on our behalf to provide our services. Where this is the case we take great care to only appoint reliable third parties who can guarantee the security of your personal information and our business information. For example, we assess each third party for their compliance with relevant privacy laws and information security practices to ensure they are able to provide the level of security that we would expect (and is required under law) when processing personal information.  Note that these third parties simply process personal information on behalf of Tes and have no right to use, disclose or transfer your personal information in any other way. Please see below in relation to our policy for transfers of personal information outside the EEA.

_**Third parties that we share your personal information with  **_

Where you have pentered into a relevnat contract with us, we will share your personal information with other third parties (who will also be data controllers in respect of the information that we share). For example, some of our Sites and services are hosted by us on behalf of those recruiting schools that have signed-up to process job vacancies and applications via the service (for example <https://www.tes.com/recruit/school-portal)>. To the extent you have any concerns about an institution's handling of your personal information you should get in touch with that institution.

_**Opting in to be contacted about job opportunities**_

Where you have opted in to be contacted about jobs, the data you have provided regarding your experience, qualifications and interests will be used alongside your site activity to match you to relevant roles. The purpose of this is to provide a limited, accurate and appropriate set of data to schools using SmartMatch Direct for recruitment purposes and ensure that you are only contacted about roles relevant to you.

Schools contact will be made via Tes with identifiable information, such as your name and contact details, not shared with the school until you have replied to them.

If you would not like to be matched with jobs in this way, please ensure the box found within the career preferences section of your profile is unticked.

###  6\. Data retention, data security and transfers of personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) 

We take steps to protect your personal information from unauthorised access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We will only keep your personal information for as long as we reasonably require and for the activities we have detailed above. This means we will retain personal information for the duration of any contract we have with you, in line with any legal obligation for data retention (such as that for HMRC) or, primarily, until erasure is requested by you.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will take steps to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted via email and/or our website; any transmission is at your own risk. 

The personal information that we collect from you will, where possible, be stored and processed within the EEA. In certain circumstances, we may require third parties that are based outside of the EEA to process, host or store your personal information and by submitting your personal information to us, you are acknowledging this transfer, storing or processing. Please note that countries outside the EEA may not have the same standard of data protection legislation as countries within the EEA.   

In the event your personal information is transferred, stored or processed outside of the EEA, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Data Protection Legislation.  This means that we will only allow third parties to access your personal information where those third parties (a) are in countries that have been confirmed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection to personal information; or (b) have agreed to provide all protections to your personal information as set out in the Data Protection Legislation (such as by entering into the European Commission's Model Clauses).
