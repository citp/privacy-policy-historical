### 7\. Use of cookies​

"Cookies" are used on our websites. Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on the hard drive of your computer. For detailed infromation on the use of Cookies on our website please see our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tesa.de/ueber-uns/rechtliche-hinweise/cookie-richtlinie "Cookie-Richtlinie")

### 8\. Social plugins

Our websites make use of "social plugins", i.e. plugins for social networks, including particularly the Facebook "Share" button. The facebook.com website is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. Responsible for the German website facebook.de is Facebook Ireland Limited, Hanover Reach, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland. The plug-ins usually feature the Facebook logo. Besides Facebook, tesa uses plug-ins by Google+ (provider: Google Inc., Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA), Twitter (provider: Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103) and Pinterest (provider: Pinterest Inc., 808 Brannan Street San Francisco, CA 94103, USA).

  
For data privacy reasons tesa has deliberately opted against utilizing direct social network plug-ins on our websites. Instead, tesa employs an alternative technical solution that allows you to decide whether to transmit data to the social network operators and when. Thus when you visit our sites, data are never automatically transmitted to social networks such as Facebook, Google, Twitter or Pinterest. Only when you actively click on the respective button yourself will your web browser connect to the servers of the respective social network, i.e. clicking on elements then clicking on the social network's icon indicates your consent to your browser connecting to the servers of the respective social network and sending usage data to that social network operator.
