We also may ask for this information at other times, such as when you enter contests or other promotions sponsored by us and/or our partners.

Data Security  
If use a feature requiring payment of a fee, we transmit your credit card data to our bank for processing. If we encounter a problem with payment, we may review the order information with you and our bank to resolve it. We do not otherwise disclose your credit card information. We do not share your email address or your personal information with third party marketers. 

We offer secure pages to collect sensitive information on our order form, such as credit card information. We also use administrative, physical and technical precautions to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information stored on our system. We host the Site at a commercial-grade data center that employs extensive security practices. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. 

Information sharing  
Other than the above mentioned sharing of data related to credit card information, we only share personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Enabilon Learning Pvt. Ltd in the following limited circumstances: 

We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to : 

  1. Satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request 
  2. Enforce applicable [Terms of Use](http://www.testfunda.com/ExamPrep/Articles/SiteContent/TermsOfUse), including investigation of potential violations thereof 
  3. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or 
  4. Protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of [TESTfunda](http://www.testfunda.com/TestFunda.aspx) or Enabilon Learning Pvt. Limited, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. 

If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as the number of users subscribed to a particular product, or the number of users registered on our website. Such information does not identify you individually. 

We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to our specified purposes. 

How Long Do We Retain User Data?  
Currently, we plan to retain user data while an account is active and for at least three years afterward. We may alter this practice according to legal and business requirements. For example, we may lengthen the retention period for some data if needed to comply with law or voluntary codes of conduct. Unless otherwise prohibited, we may shorten the retention period for some types of data if needed to free up storage space.
