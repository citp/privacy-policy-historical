Sensitive Data includes, by way of example, Clients' confidential data, individuals' home telephone numbers, Bank Account, Income Tax and National Insurance numbers, interview notes, CV's, etc. If your relationship with us includes providing tessuti.co.uk with Sensitive Data, we will protect that information with extra care.
