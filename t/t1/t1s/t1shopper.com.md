In such situations, we will be acting on behalf of the Client, under the authority of the Carrier's privacy policy, a copy of which you should receive from the Carrier. All of the information-sharing we do as agent for the Carrier would be permissible under applicable federal law for the Carrier to do directly.

From time to time, T1 Shopper may notify you about a special offer from one of our promotional partners. At your request, T1 Shopper will not send you any information or offers unrelated to your request for financing.
