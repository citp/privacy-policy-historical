In order to provide better services, TTnet may conduct internal research on the number, preferences and behaviors of users, based on the information gathered in accordance with above rules. The internal research conducted by TTnet is to arrange and analyze the aggregate information of all users. TTnet will never analyze the information of any individual user. Unless with your permission or one of the following exceptions occurs, we will not disclose (including selling/exchanging/renting) your data to any individual or third party. Once you become our member, you will receive the latest information about the website, products, trade, etc. sent by e-mail system of our Customer Service Center.

TTnet maintains the right to share analytic results with its business partners, which is limited to aggregate analytic results.

● TTnet reasonably believes that disclosure is permitted by law.

To maintain the normal operation of this website 

  * **Limitation of Liability**

As long as this website receives the data you send, it will take greatest efforts to ensure the security of the data storage in our system. However due to the openness of the Internet, even though the website is committed to protecting user data, it still can not completely guarantee the data you transmit or send is absolutely safe.  
Please note: This site links with other sites; manufacturers who have posted information on these websites may also collect your data, but they are not necessarily the same policy as ours to protect your privacy. When you click on information results of or participate in their joint activities with this site, if you have questions concerning their way of using your information, please contact them directly. Because that website does not monitor user activity, and that website does not have a privacy policy for individual users, this site's privacy statement is not applicable, so we are not responsible for data collection activities of users on that site.
