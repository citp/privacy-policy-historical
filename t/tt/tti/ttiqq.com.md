A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser. In most cases, browsers are set by default to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

Opt-in consent is mandatory for sharing of any sensitive personal information. 2) Business Use. We may have a need to provide such information to our affiliated companies, other trusted businesses, or individuals for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. If TTiqq becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, user information would be transferred and subject to a different privacy policy. 3) Legal Requirements. Your personal information may be released when we have a good faith belief that release is necessary to satisfy any applicable law, legal process, regulation, enforceable governmental request, to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions, to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or to protect against harm to the property, rights, or safety of TTiqq, its employees, users or others.
