# Privacy

**Personal Information**  
We consider all information captured using Tadpoles Pro to be a private communication between Providers and Parents. No personal information is shared with any external parties unless a Provider has explicitly invited a Parent to establish communications. All invitations are handled via the Parent's email address and a valid Google account is required for the Parent to authenticate and view the information. No personally identifiable information is sent via emails and instead Parents are required to login to the Tadpoles web application or mobile application to view updates about their children to ensure only authorized viewers have access to information. 

**What do we use your information for?**   
Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways: 

  * To personalize your experience
(your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)  

  * To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature
  * To send periodic emails, newsletters, and periodic updates



The email address you provide for registration, will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to our services.

**How do we protect your information?**   
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information.  
All supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and encrypted.
