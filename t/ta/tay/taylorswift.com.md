**_What is our policy on children’s privacy?_**

The Sites are not for children under 13 years of age.  However, there are some areas of the Sites that may be attractive to children under 13.  We do not condition participation by a child of any age in any activity or any of the services available on or through the Sites on the disclosure of more personally-identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.  We do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from users of the Sites who are under 13 years of age.  No personally-identifiable information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Sites by visitors under 13 years of age without the prior written consent of their parent or guardian. 

If we receive an e-mail message from a child who discloses, or is otherwise known to us, to be under 13 years of age, we may, without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian:

  * Respond to a one-time request from the child; 
  * Provide notice of the child’s communication to the child’s parent or guardian; 
  * Use this information as may be necessary to ensure the safety of the child on the Sites; or 
  * Send our electronic periodical publications and materials, with the notification to the child’s parent or guardian and the opportunity to discontinue any future delivery of the above information. 



Any parent or guardian of a child under 13 years of age who has provided personally-identifiable information to us may request a description of the personally-identifiable information that has been collected from or about that child, and either limit or restrict any further maintenance or use of such information from that child and/or direct us to delete it.  Also, a parent may decline to allow any future collection of personally-identifiable information from that child.  Such requests can be made by contacting us at [webmaster@taylorswift.com](mailto:webmaster@taylorswift.com). We will take reasonable measures to verify that the requesting party is, in fact, the parent or guardian of the child in question before providing a child’s personally-identifiable information to such person.  

A parent may also access the personally-identifiable information that has been collected by us through accessing the “My Account” area of that parent’s child’s account by logging into the Sites with that child’s account name and password.

We will not knowingly use or disclose any personally-identifiable information of a child under 13 years of age for any purpose except as described above.     

**_What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?_**

**_The types of information we collect and how we collect it_**

By accessing or using the Sites, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personally-identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to disclose to us, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card information; and (2) non-personally-identifiable information, which we collect through the use of the technology called “cookies,” “web beacons” and/or “web logs.”  You do not need to submit personally-identifiable information to access certain areas of the Sites, but if you do not want to disclose certain personally-identifiable information to us, you will not be able to access certain aspects of the Services.

We collect personally-identifiable information when you create an account, subscribe to our mailing list, participate in chat rooms, forums, polls, surveys, and questionnaires, participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions, purchase a product, contact us, or receive customer or technical support.  

To subscribe to our mailing list, you will need to provide your e-mail address, the country of your primary residence, your postal code and your date of birth.  You will also need to create a screen name and password to access  some of the other Services.  When you are purchasing products, you will need to provide your name, address, e-mail address and phone number and, additionally, we or one of our third-party payment or fulfillment service providers will ask for your shipping and billing address and credit card, debit card or other payment information.  

We may also collect other types of information (known as demographic information) such as your gender, hobbies and interests. This demographic information may be associated with your personally-identifiable information.

**_How we use your personally-identifiable information_**

The personally-identifiable information that you provide to us will allow us to fulfill your product or service order, contact you about your account or your order of our products or services, alert you of new products or services, features or enhancements, notify you of changes in the Services, handle/route your customer service questions or issues, and/or inform you of contests, promotions, or special events and offers.   

We keep track of your interactions with us, including, but not limited to, your activity within the Services.  We may use information relating to your interactions with us to generate information about the popularity of certain Services and how users of the Sites utilize different aspects of the Services (“ ** _Popularity Data_** ”).  We may use this Popularity Data to design, develop and implement additional services and features of the Sites and to improve the Services.  Popularity Data may be associated with your account and we may provide a point system in which your account earns points through the amount of Popularity Data your account has achieved.  These points may be displayed with the account information that is publicly displayed to other end users of the Sites, such as when you participate in a forum in the Sites, but we do not disclose the Popularity Data itself as associated with your account.  

We may use personally-identifiable information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Services.
