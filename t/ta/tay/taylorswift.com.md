Under applicable law, Taylor Nation is considered the “data controller” of the personal data we collect under this Privacy Policy (the “ **Policy** ”). Contact information for Taylor Nation is located at the end of this Policy. 

This Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that we learn about you as a result of your interaction with us through the websites on which this Policy is posted (including the websites that you may access using your mobile electronic device), through the services provided through such websites, and through offline events where you may provide us with information, whether before, during, or after the offline event (collectively the “Services”). **PLEASE READ THIS POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.

When you click on an advertisement or a logo displayed on any of the Services that links you to a different website (including, without limitation, Facebook, Instagram, iTunes, tumblr, Twitter and YouTube), or when you use any third-party app, tool, widget, plug-in or extension on the Services or as part of any of the Services, information about you may be collected through automated means. We do not control, and are not responsible for, any third party’s collection and use of your information. You should refer to the privacy policies of such third parties to learn about their information collection, use and disclosure practices. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

We obtain information about you through the means discussed below when you access or use the Services.

As discussed further below, we and our service providers (which are third-party companies that work on our behalf), may use a variety of technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.

We may combine these types of information together. We may also aggregate and/or anonymize any information collected through the Services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device. We may use such information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors.

 **WHAT ARE OUR LEGAL BASES FOR USING YOUR INFORMATION?**

The laws in some jurisdictions require us to tell you about the legal ground we rely upon in order to use or disclose your information.  Where those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows: 

  * **To perform our obligations under a contract with you.** For example, to comply with the terms of service of our websites, which you accept by browsing the Services, or when you register for an account at our store.
  

  * **Consent.** Where required by law and in some other cases, we collect and use your information on the basis of your implied or express consent. 
  

  * **To further our or our partners’ legitimate interests.** For example, to provide security for the Services, operate our business and the Services, comply with legal requirements, and prevent fraud.



 **DO YOU USE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES?**

To collect the information in the “Information We Automatically Collect” section above, we and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. We use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enable us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv) enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files. 

As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including flash cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website. You can also visit your mobile device manufacturer's website (or the website for its operating system) for instructions on any additional privacy controls in your mobile operating system, such as privacy settings for device identifiers and geolocation. Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.

 **DO YOU USE ONLINE ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGIES?**

 **1\. Analytics**

We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) on our Services to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; assist with fraud prevention; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by [clicking here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 

If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools (such as clear GIFs) to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.

 **2\. Online Advertising**

The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests. 

Third parties may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. These third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) may also serve tailored ads to you as you use the Internet and Internet-connected applications, and access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services to assist in this activity. 

We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/), the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link](http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/), or if you live in the European Union, [Your Online Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/), to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Ads for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the [Google Ads Settings page](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated). We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. 

Please note that if you exercise the choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.

 **3\. Notice Concerning Do Not Track**

You may be able to adjust your browser’s settings to turn on a “do not track” feature. Although our policy may change in the future, because there is no uniform standard for “do not track” signal recognition currently, we do not support “do not track” and will not honor your web browser’s “do not track” signal.

We do not intentionally or knowingly allow other parties to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites, when you visit the websites or use any of the Services. 

**WHEN DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES?**

We may use your information to provide analyses of the users of the Services, in the aggregate, to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties.
