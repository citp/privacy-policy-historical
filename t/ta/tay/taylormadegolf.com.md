TAYLORMADE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER LAW. NO VERBAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY TAYLORMADE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL TAYLORMADE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE TAYLORMADE WEBSITES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO RELIANCE BY YOU ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE TAYLORMADE WEBSITES THAT RESULTS IN MISTAKES, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS, DELETION OR CORRUPTION OF FILES, VIRUSES, DELAYS IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, OR ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE.

**Products, Content and Specifications**

 All features, content, specifications, products and prices of products and services described or depicted on the TaylorMade Websites are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on the TaylorMade Websites at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time.  From time to time, certain product listings on the TaylorMade Websites may show a product’s original price stricken through, alongside a reduced price.  These products may be non-current models and may be on permanent markdown. 

**Applicability of Content**

Information on this site includes description of products and services that may be available in the United States of America only. This site is operated in the State of California, United States of America, and TaylorMade makes no representation that the content provided is applicable or appropriate for use in other locations.

**Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights**

You and TaylorMade agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and TaylorMade hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim. All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and TaylorMade relating to these Terms or the TaylorMade Websites (each a “Claim”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA Rules”) in San Diego, California. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.

If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, TaylorMade will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

 This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or TaylorMade from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and TaylorMade also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and TaylorMade retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.  

Neither you nor TaylorMade may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or TaylorMade’s individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.  

If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms. This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with TaylorMade.  

THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR TAYLORMADE WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

**Privacy**

We realize that consumers are concerned about how the information they provide online will be used. Please read our [Privacy Policy](http://taylormadegolf.com/about-us/privacy.html#privacy) for more details. 

**Enforcement of Terms and Conditions**

These Terms are governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of California, United States of America, without reference to its provisions concerning conflicts of law.

Without limiting the arbitration agreement set forth above, you agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms or the TaylorMade Websites will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the County of San Diego, State of California). You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.

If any part of these Terms is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. TaylorMade may revise these Terms at any time by updating this posting.

Under no circumstances will TaylorMade be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond its reasonable control.

The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent TaylorMade from enforcing such right or provision in the future.

TaylorMade may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or equity, or by operation of law.

TaylorMade reserves the right to not provide the TaylorMade websites to any person.  TaylorMade also reserves the right to terminate any user’s right to access the TaylorMade websites at any time, in its discretion.  If you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the TaylorMade websites automatically terminates.

From time to time, TaylorMade may change these Terms.  If TaylorMade changes these Terms, it will give you notice by posting the revised Terms on the TaylorMade Websites.  Those changes will go into effect on the Revision Date shown in the revised Terms.  BY CONTINUING TO USE THE TAYLORMADE WEBSITES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THE REVISED TERMS. 

PLEASE PRINT A COPY OF THESE TERMS FOR YOU RECORDS AND PLEASE CHECK THE TAYLORMADE WEBSITES FREQUENTLY FOR ANY CHANGES TO THESE TERMS.

Our Cookies

Your browser software includes a feature called "cookies." If enabled, cookies may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the TaylorMade Websites. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you visit most often and what content you may have viewed during past visits. When you re-visit the TaylorMade Websites, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to:

  * keep count of return visits to the TaylorMade Websites
  * accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on website usage
  * deliver content and advertising specific to your interests or past viewing history



You can also disable cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set.

IP Addresses

TaylorMade does not store or record the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses of visitors to the TaylorMade Websites for marketing purposes, although we may store IP addresses in server logs for features such as to keep your shopping cart active, for system maintenance purposes, or to store the source location whenever someone provides Personal Information. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. An Internet Service Providers ("ISP") typically assigns a random IP addresses at the time of your dial-up. For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. We cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages, but these IP addresses are never associated with Internet users.

Web Beacons

The TaylorMade Websites and certain emails sent to opt-in consumers contain electronic images (called "pixels", "transparent GIF files", or "web beacons") that allow us and our advertising partners to view and access cookies. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are small in order not to use valuable space on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content. In some cases these files are provided by our online management partner. These files enable our online management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to the TaylorMade Websites. The cookie was placed by us or by another advertiser that works with our online management partner. We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters and other emails containing graphics that we send, so we may count the number of newsletters and emails that have been opened and read.

Advertising and Online Tracking

We may also use the web beacon and cookies to monitor your online behavior and interests on the TaylorMade Websites and communications from TaylorMade to tailor advertisements and other communications shown and sent to you for goods and services. With both cookies and web beacons, the information stored by the web beacon or cookie does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. Our systems do not recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals, but several of our service providers who utilize these cookies and other tracking technologies on the TaylorMade Websites enable you to opt out of this type of advertising. For more information about third party cookies and web beacons, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, [click here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cookies) or click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of marketing from us or certain transfers of your information. Please see the “Personal Information Maintenance & Opt-Out” section of this Privacy Policy for more information.

Computer Profiles

TaylorMade may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For example, we may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. If you do not register on one of the TaylorMade Websites, none of this information is personally identifiable.

Security

The TaylorMade Websites use physical, electronic and managerial security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.

  * We use Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") connections with 128-bit encryption for certain transactions and confidential data. When you use a secure browser, all information you submit comes to us over the Internet in an encrypted form. Every secure page uses a digital certificate issued by a third-party certification authority. A "site certificate" sits on all secure pages. To view this certificate, click on the image of the closed lock or the solid key on the bottom bar of your browser window.
  * We monitor system and application activity logs to identify any unusual activity from authorized and/or unauthorized individuals accessing our systems and/or making changes to stored information. We regularly perform preventative system maintenance and monitoring to ensure the security of our data systems.
  * We maintain our servers in locked facilities with secure access. Backup tapes are retrieved daily and stored by an independent company in a secure, off-site location.



The TaylorMade Websites do not require you to set up a user ID and password unless you subscribe for some of our special services or create a purchasing account with us. We recommend you do not divulge your password to anyone. TaylorMade will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited telephone call or email.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit, and you do so at your own risk. You can report network abuse and any risk of security violations to us by emailing [privacy@tmag.com](mailto:privacy@tmag.com).

Children's Online Privacy Protection

TaylorMade does not knowingly collect contact or personal information from children under 13.  The TaylorMade Websites are not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13.  If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.  If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by emailing us at [privacy@tmag.com](mailto:privacy@tmag.com).
