          Company, Inc. d/b/a TaylorMade-adidas Golf Company ("TMaG").
          TMaG values your right of privacy, and wants you to feel comfortable

          and all other TMaG websites (the "TMaG Websites"). This page
          describes our policy with regard to online privacy and explains how
          you can opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your personal information.
          As a courtesy, this page also provides a number of useful links to
          third party information regarding privacy protection. However, TMaG
          does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy and/or completeness
          of such third party information.</p>
        <a name="Acceptance" id="Acceptance"></a>
        <p class="bold">Your Acceptance</p>
        <p>By visiting, using, and/or registering on any of the TMaG Websites,
          you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Privacy
          Policy. If you do not so agree, you should not use the TMaG Websites.
          Should we make any substantial changes in the way we collect and/or
          use any personal information we will amend this Privacy Policy, or
          we may email you if you have not opted out of email notifications.</p>
        <a name="TMaGWebsites" id="TMaGWebsites"></a>
        <p class="bold">TMaG Websites</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the TMaG Websites. Links within
          these sites could direct you to third party websites that are not owned
          or controlled by TMaG. TMaG has no control over, and assumes no responsibility
          for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party
          websites, which may employ cookies and/or collect personal information.
          In addition, TMaG will not and cannot censor or edit the content of
          any third party site. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the
          TMaG Websites, and to read the privacy policy of each website that
          you visit.<br>
          TMaG affiliates may have their own privacy policy governing websites
          other than the above TMaG Websites.</p>
        <a name="Information" id="Information"></a>
        <p class="bold">What Type of Personal Information Do We Collect and Use?</p>
        <p>Whenever you register a TMaG product, send us an email, purchase products
          from a TMaG Website, register on one of the TMaG Websites, enter to
          win a contest, subscribe to one of our newsletters, or otherwise transmit
          information via any of the TMaG Websites, TMaG may obtain and collect
          personally identifiable contact information (expressed herein generally
          as "personal information") such as your name, email address,
          payment information (i.e. credit card number/expiration date), and/or
          mailing address, subject to your ability to "opt-out" of
          our future use or disclosure of such information.</p>
        <a name="Maintenance" id="Maintenance"></a>
        <p class="bold">Personal Information Maintenance &amp; Opt-Out</p>
        <p>If you wish to opt-out of our use and/or disclosure of your personal
          information, other than as expressly covered in this Privacy Policy
          and/or to process any purchase orders, you will generally have the
          option to do so when you first submit your personal information via
          the TMaG Websites. Simply indicate your desire to opt-out by checking
          or un-checking the appropriate box. If you wish to amend or delete
          any personal information you have previously provided without opt-out,
          please send us a message at <a href="mailto:consumer.feedback@tmag.com">consumer.feedback@tmag.com</a>.
          We will endeavor to provide a simple way to review, correct, update
          or remove personal information you have given us. If you wish to stop
          receiving a TMaG newsletter that you have previously subscribed for,
          please follow the "unsubscribe" 
          instructions contained at the bottom of each newsletter.</p>
        <a name="Use" id="Use"></a>
        <p class="bold">How Do We Use Personal Information?</p>
        <p>TMaG will never disclose your email address to third parties for use
          in connection with any email marketing campaign of a third party or
          business partner (excluding TMaG subsidiary companies).</p>
        <p>TMaG may always use personal information in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> to enable us to respond to you generally, or to process, validate
            and verify requests and/or purchase orders</li>
          <li> to perform any services requested by you</li>
          <li> to compile and/or distribute aggregate - never individual - information
            about our website users and aggregate usage patterns</li>
          <li> to provide our own website designers with useful information for
            developing new features and services that meet your needs</li>
          <li> to tailor your experience on our websites, showing you content
            we think might interest you or altering the content according to
            your personal preferences</li>
          <li>as part of an online employment application to evaluate your qualifications
            only</li>
        </ul>
        <p>TMaG will not disclose your email address for use in connection with
          a third party's marketing efforts.</p>
        <p>If you have not "opted-out" of our use and disclosure of
          your personal information, TMaG may also use personal information for
          all marketing and survey purposes on behalf of itself and its affiliates
          and subsidiaries. TMaG may appoint third party agents in connection
          with such marketing and survey efforts. TMaG may disclose personal
          information to select business partners for use in connection with
          direct mail marketing efforts, but that personal information will not
          include your email address.<br>
          If you have "opted-out", TMaG will use or disclose your personal
          information only as stated above, or: (1) when legally ordered to do
          so by a lawful subpoena or court order, (2) if you violate or breach
          an agreement with TMaG, (3) if we believe you will harm the property
          or rights of TMaG or those of TMaG's other customers, (4) under exigent
          circumstances to protect the physical safety of TMaG, its employees,
          users or the general public, or (5) to validate credit card numbers
          for charging for fee services.</p>
        <a name="Aggregate" id="Aggregate"></a>
        <p class="bold">Aggregate Information</p>
        <p>TMaG may share aggregate statistical information with business partners,
          sponsors or other third parties, but none of them receive individual
          identifying information about you. For example, we may tell an advertiser
          that X number of visitors visited a certain area on a website, or that
          Y number of men and Z number of women filled out registration forms,
          but we would not disclose anything that uniquely identifies those individuals.</p>
        <a name="Email" id="Email"></a>
        <p class="bold">Unsolicited Emails Received by You</p>
        <p>TMaG does not send unsolicited bulk emails to anyone who has requested
          that we do not contact them. We send our newsletters only to those
          who have taken affirmative steps to subscribe. If you have inadvertently
          received one of our newsletters, or if you simply wish to stop receiving
          them, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions contained
          in each newsletter or send a request to be unsubscribed to <a href="mailto:consumer.feedback@tmag.com">consumer.feedback@tmag.com</a>.</p>
        <a name="Forums" id="Forums"></a>
        <p class="bold">Chat Rooms and Forums</p>
        <p>The TMaG Websites may now or in the future include chat rooms, forums,
          message boards, and/or news groups. Any information that is disclosed
          in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution
          before disclosing your personal information via these public venues,
          which you do at your own risk. If you do so, you may receive unsolicited
          emails or "spam" from others. TMaG cannot safeguard the privacy
          of personal information that is disclosed online in this manner. </p>
        <a name="Cookies" id="Cookies"></a>
        <p><span class="bold">Our Cookies</span></p>
        <p>Your browser software includes a feature called 
          "cookies." If enabled, cookies may store small amounts of
          data on your computer about your visit to any of the TMaG Websites.
          However, cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically
          give us additional information. Cookies assist us in tracking which
          of our features you like best and what content you may have viewed
          during past visits. When you re-visit the TMaG Websites, cookies can
          enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We
          may use cookies to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keep count of return visits to the TMaG Websites</li>
          <li> accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information <br>
            on website usage</li>
          <li>deliver content specific to your interests or past viewing history</li>
          <li> save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time
            you visit our websites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also disable cookies. By modifying your browser preferences,
          you can accept or reject all cookies, or request a notification when
          a cookie is set. </p>
        <a name="IP" id="IP"></a>
        <p class="bold">IP Addresses</p>
        <p>TMaG does not store or record the Internet Protocol ("IP")
          addresses of visitors to the Website for marketing purposes, although
          we may store IP addresses in server logs for system maintenance purposes
          or to store the source location whenever someone provides Personal
          Information. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer whenever
          you access the Internet. An Internet Service Providers ("ISP")
          typically assigns a random IP addresses at the time of your dial-up.
          For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users,
          an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer.
          We cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address.
          Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting
          from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit
          have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites
          and their pages, but these IP addresses are never associated with Internet
          users.</p>
        <a name="Beacons" id="Beacons"></a>
        <p class="bold">Web Beacons</p>
        <p>The TMaG Websites contain electronic images (called "pixels", 
          "transparent GIF files", or "web beacons") that allow us and our advertising
          partners to view and access cookies. In general, any electronic image
          viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a
          web beacon. Web beacons are small in order not to use valuable space
          on the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content.
          In some cases these files are provided by our online management partner.
          These files enable our online management partner to recognize a unique
          cookie on your web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which
          advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by
          us or by another advertiser that works with our online management partner.
          We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters containing
          graphics that we send to opt-in subscribers, so we may count the number
          of newsletters that have been opened and read. We may also use the
          web beacon and cookies to monitor your online behavior and interests
          on the TMaG Websites. With both cookies and web beacons, the information
          that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
          It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email
          address. For more information about third party cookies, including
          information about how to opt out of these technologies, <a href="http://doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">click
          here.</a></p>
        <a name="Profiles" id="Profiles"></a>
        <p class="bold">Computer Profiles</p>
        <p>TMaG may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data that helps
          us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors.
          For example, we may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain
          names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen
          resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings,
          cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement.
          If you do not register on one of the TMaG Websites, none of this information
          is personally identifiable.</p>
        <a name="Security" id="Security"></a>
        <p class="bold">Security</p>
        <p>The TMaG Websites use physical, electronic and managerial security
          measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information
          under our control.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We use Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") connections with 128-bit
            encryption for certain transactions and confidential data. When you
            use a secure browser, all information you submit comes to us over
            the Internet in an encrypted form. Every secure page uses a digital
            certificate issued by a third-party certification authority. A "site
            certificate" 
            sits on all secure pages. To view this certificate, click on the
            image of the closed lock or the solid key on the bottom bar of your
            browser window.</li>
          <li> We monitor system and application activity logs to identify any
            unusual activity from authorized and/or unauthorized individuals
            accessing our systems and/or making changes to stored information.
            We regularly perform preventative system maintenance and monitoring
            to ensure the security of our data systems.</li>
          <li> We maintain our servers in locked facilities with secure access.
            Backup tapes are retrieved daily and stored by an independent company
            in a secure, off-site location.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The TMaG Websites do not require you to set up a user ID and password
          unless you subscribe for some of our special services, create a purchasing
          account with us, or are an InerCircle member seeking access to your
          account information. We recommend you do not divulge your password
          to anyone. TMaG will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited
          telephone call or email.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless
          network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we
          strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant
          the security of any information you transmit, and you do so at your
          own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort
          to ensure its security on our systems. You can report network abuse
          and any risk of security violations to us by emailing <a href="mailto:abuse@tmag.com">abuse@tmag.com</a>.</p>
        <a name="Children" id="Children"></a>
        <p class="bold">Children's Online Privacy Protection</p>
        <p>The TMaG Websites comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
          Act of 1998, which protects the privacy of children using the Internet.
          TMaG does not knowingly collect contact or personal information from
          children under 13. The TMaG Websites are not intended to solicit information
          of any kind from children under 13, and are designed to block our knowing
          acceptance of any such information. It is possible that by fraud or
          deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13.
          If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we
          will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information
          from our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information
          by children under 13, please do so by emailing us at <a href="mailto:consumer.feedback@tmag.com">consumer.feedback@tmag.com</a>.</p>
