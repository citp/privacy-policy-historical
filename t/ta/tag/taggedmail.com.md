Member agrees to immediately notify Tagged of any unauthorized use of Member's account or any other breach of security known to Member.  
**G) Copyrights, Trademarks, Patents and Intellectual Property Rights**  
Member acknowledges that messages, files or other materials ("Content") contained on the Tagged website and within Tagged email messages, and third party advertisements on the website and distributed via email, of a commercial nature and presented to Member by Tagged and the Services, are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents or other proprietary rights and laws. Member is permitted to use Tagged Content or third party Content only as expressly authorized by Tagged or the third party advertiser.

The arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco County, California, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

If Member is a California resident, Member waives California Civil Code Section 1542, which says "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

Updated as of February 7, 2006  
**PRIVACY POLICY**  
**User Privacy**  
Tagged is a fun website for teenagers that lets you refer your friends to sign up and join each others' Tag Teams. Like any website that offers a service where you register and provide information about yourself or your opinions, it is wise to pay attention to your personal information. At Tagged we understand this, and have established this Privacy Policy to explain how information is collected on our website, and how this information is used. Members Must Be Between 13 and 19 Years of Age. Tagged is intended solely for use by persons 13 to 19 years of age. All persons under 13 or over 19 years of age are prohibited from registering on Tagged. An account created by a person between the ages of 13 and 19 will not be terminated once that person turns 20, however new accounts may not be created by this person at the age of 20.  
**How Does Tagged Protect Children’s Privacy?**  
The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to us. 

Tagged is a general audience web site that complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our registration process is designed to restrict children under the age of 13 from becoming members of Tagged and using our site. We've also designed the tone and style of the site to appeal to teenagers only (ages 13-19). If we receive information suggesting that a user who has registered with Tagged is under the age of 13, we require the user to provide evidence confirming that the user is at least 13 years old. If the user fails to provide such information within 48 hours, we immediately terminate the user’s account and nullify all personally identifiable information displaying on the site and collected from such user.   
  
**What Is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act?**  
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires that commercial web sites obtain parental consent (under most circumstances) prior to the collection of any personally identifiable information from children whom they know to be under the age of 13. In addition, COPPA requires that web sites that collect personal information from children under the age of 13 provide parents with: 

  * Notice. Parents must be provided notice regarding what information is collected, how the information will be used, and with whom the information may be shared. 
  * The ability to prevent further use of the information collected about the child and prevent any future collection of personal information from the child. 
  * The ability to access and review their child's personal information. 

COPPA also limits the amount of personal information a web site can collect from a child. Web sites may not collect any more personal information than is necessary to participate in a given game or activity. 

For more information about COPPA, please visit the [Federal Trade Commission's web site](http://www.ftc.gov/). 

Parents: If your child is under the age of 13 and has joined Tagged using a false age, please notify Tagged Tagged Site & Safety Squad at [SiteSquad@Tagged.com](mailto:SiteSquad@Tagged.com), and we will immediately cancel your child's account and nullify all personally identifiable information displaying on the site and collected from them. If you would like to know more about our site, information practices, stored information about your child, or how to close your child's account, please contact Tagged Tagged Site & Safety Squad at [SiteSquad@Tagged.com](mailto:SiteSquad@Tagged.com). We will happily respond to all email from parents with Privacy questions or concerns.   
  
**User Information Collected by Tagged**  
**Personally Identifiable User Information**  
All users begin using Tagged's services by registering on the Tagged website. When registering, users provide personally identifiable information, which includes their first and last name, email address, mailing address, which school they attend, a user-chosen password, and data of birth, and other personal information. During registration, users also complete survey questions that provide information that is helpful for us to understand the demographics and consumer behavior of our users, such as identifying the users' eye color, style, personality type, favorite color, sport, food, activity or TV show, post-graduation plans or graduation year. Users are also asked to select "Tags" related to their talents, or complete a questionnaire for their online profile, which includes a variety of questions about the user's interests. Users may also provide journal entries to an online journal. To complete the registration process, Tagged sends a validation email message to each user, with a URL link back to our website. This URL contains an alphanumeric identifier and a user-specific numeric passcode that allows us to confirm the user's identity.   
**Cookies and Passive Data Collection**  
Tagged logs standard user information and clickstream data for all users, including a user's IP address, operating system, and page views. When users visit particular pages within Tagged, a UserID may be placed in the URL, allowing customized features for the user. Users should be aware that other websites visited before entering Tagged might place personally identifiable information within a user's URL during a visit to their website, and Tagged has no control over such websites. Accordingly, some of this information may be logged by a subsequent website that collects URL information. In addition to the standard log information, Tagged uses a variety of technologies to create a more personalized experience for its users. Cookies are small data files sent by websites to a user's browser and hard drive that identify the computer to the website. We use cookies to allow enhanced features, such as allowing registered users to bypass typing their passwords before entering the website. We may also use cookies to enable customizable content for users, as they become available. Users have the option, within their Internet browsers, to disable cookies and continue to access the Tagged website. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages. We use pixel tags to gather information about the e-mails we send to our registered users. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer accesses our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, and allows us to record and store the date and time, the recipient's e-mail address, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may read cookies. Tagged web pages may also contain similar pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to compile aggregated statistics about site usage, and to deliver co-branded services as they become available. Tagged pixel tags collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides. Tagged web pages may also contain pixel tags placed there by third party ad servers, to monitor the effectiveness of their advertising.  
**How Tagged Uses the User Information**  
**Personally Identifiable Information**  
Tagged uses personally identifiable user information for the purposes of the Tagged website, the Tagged referral and Tag Team building. We also use email addresses to send useful information to all registered users regarding the Tagged website. For example, we use email addresses of users, and of those persons provided on their referral lists, to send an invitation to the referred friend and encourage them to sign up on Tagged. When a user lists an email address on the referral page, an email is automatically sent from that registered user to the referral address, encouraging the referral to sign up on the Tagged website. If the referred person does not sign up within a few days, we also send a reminder from the registered user to the referral address. All registered users will be able to view other users Stats, Profiles, Journals and Tag Team pages, which may include personal information and responses to survey questions. If a registered user refers a friend who goes on to sign up on our site, then the registered user earns points. For more information about the point system, see <http://www.tagged.com/huh.html>. Tagged does not share the email address of any registered user with third parties unless the user specifically requests and authorizes that the user's email address be provided to such third party in order to receive information or participate in an offer. Tagged does not, however, sell or market the personally identifiable information of any unregistered user to or with any third party.   
**Cookies and Passive Data Collection**  
Tagged uses cookie, IP address, clickstream and URL information to improve the content of the Tagged website, the quality of Tagged servers, and to provide enhanced features to users, where available. We use cookies to save UserIDs, session validators, and on users' browsers and hard drives, and may use them to provide tailored products or services to those users, as they become available. We also cross-match user information with information collected from cookies and clickstream data in order to test features of the Tagged website, and to better personalize our various offerings for users. IP Addresses also help us to diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Tagged site, and to otherwise provide the Tagged service to its users. IP addresses may be disclosed to a third party if we believe in good faith that the law or legal process so requires, or to protect the rights or property of Tagged or others. From time to time we may extend various offers from various partner companies, including news or additional details on products and services. A user's usage history may result in specifically tailored special offer screens or products. We may also produce aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, we may report to advertisers the number of users who clicked on an ad, or the number of users that visited different portions of the Tagged website. This information will not include personally identifiable information about a user, or a specific user's online usage patterns.  
**Profile Information**  
Tagged allows Members to provide information to a profile and/or journal entries that is accessible to other users. We use this profile information for the purposes of providing our services to you, such as to analyze demographics, to better personalize our various offerings for users, or to enable other users to find your profile. All information, including any personally identifiable information, which is disclosed by users in his or her public profile and journal entries are available for others to see. Please do not post direct contact information in either your profile or your journal, such as your email addresses, URLs, instant messenger IDs, phone numbers, full names, or addresses. We also caution you not to share sensitive information (such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, and driver's license numbers) with other users whom you do not know or place such information in your profile.  
**Invitations**  
The Invite Friends feature is an easy way for Tagged users to invite friends through email. The email address(es) that you supply to use this service will only be used to send invitations to join your Tag Team.  
**Surveys and Contests**  
At various times we may offer surveys or contests to users. Surveys may ask for contact, demographic or unique identifying information to increase the value of the results. Contests may require contact information or other demographic or personally identifiable information in order to determine eligibility. Tagged may use information collected from surveys and contests for the entertainment of users, and to determine, notify and contact winners of various contests. In addition, users' demographic and/or personally identifiable information and responses to survey and contest questions may be used by Tagged and/or shared with third parties in order to provide specifically tailored special offers or advertisements. Tagged will not share a user's email address with third parties unless the user specifically opts-in to such sharing during the completion of or registration for a survey or contest.   
**Third Party Links and Ad Servers**  
Please be aware that links to third party websites and third-party ad server advertisements that are found on Tagged may, or may not, use cookies, pixel tags and web tags. Tagged may provide links to third party websites, which may, or may not, use cookies, pixel tags and web tags. Ad servers may also use these tools to compile information about where users saw particular advertisements, and to determine which ads were clicked on. We are not responsible for, or have any control over, the privacy policies of those third party websites and ad servers, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when linking directly from Tagged.  
**Protection of Tagged and Others**  
Tagged may disclose personally identifiable user information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. Tagged may also disclose information about its users to law enforcement officers or others, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms of Service; respond to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third-parties; or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Tagged, its users or the general public.   
**Security**  
Tagged uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the Tagged website in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.  
**Updating or Removing User Information**  
As a registered user, you may, at any time, choose to correct or update the information you have submitted to us. This may be done by the following method:  
1) Log in to your Tagged account on our website.  
2) Click the button that says "Update Account Info," under "My Stats."   
3) Change or edit any of the information there, and then click the button at the bottom that says "Update".  
As a registered user, you may, at any time, cancel your account by emailing Tagged Tagged Site & Safety Squad at [SiteSquad@Tagged.com](mailto:SiteSquad@Tagged.com) and requesting cancellation of your account.

Any person receiving an email message from Tagged has the opportunity to opt out of receiving future messages, simply by entering their email address and clicking the "Unsubscribe" button. If a user has an active Tagged.com account, choosing to opt-out (unsubscribe) will not cancel the account -- it will still be active, but the user will not receive any more email from Tagged. Users can manage their mailing preferences to specify which type of email to opt out of on their Update Account Info page when they are logged in, simply by un-checking the boxes indicating which type of email they would not like to receive. Users can also cancel their account by emailing Tagged Tagged Site & Safety Squad at [SiteSquad@Tagged.com](mailto:SiteSquad@Tagged.com). Canceling one's account will also prevent a user from receiving future communications from Tagged, and Tagged will not share the user's information with third parties for marketing purposes.   
**No Spam Policy**  
We at Tagged.com are opposed to spam. Our No Spam Policy and Terms of Service prohibit all users from engaging in any activity involving spam on our service. Violations of these policies may result in immediate termination of service and legal action against any spammer. Tagged's Terms of Service expressly prohibit users from uploading, posting, emailing, transmitting or otherwise making available junk mail, commercial advertisements, or other form of commercial solicitation on the Tagged website or through Tagged's services. Any violation of our policies, by sending unsolicited email advertisements to or through Tagged.com computer systems, will use or cause to be used Tagged.com servers, located in California. Accordingly, any unauthorized use of Tagged.com computer systems is a violation of our policies and certain federal and state laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. sect 1030 et seq.), Section 502 of the California Penal Code and Section 17538.45 of the California Business and Professions Code. Such violations may subject the sender and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.  
**Other Disclosures**  
**Change of Ownership**  
In the event of a change in ownership, or a direct merger or acquisition with another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of Tagged's user information, including email addresses and postal addresses, to a separate entity. All registered users will be notified of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of Tagged's assets by a third party, and may choose to modify any of their registration information at that time.

Tagged reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner. Notice of any revision, amendment, or modification will be posted on the website, and a user's continued use of Tagged will signify agreement to such changes.
