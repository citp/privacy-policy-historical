# Privacy Policy —

We understand your concerns about how your information is used and shared, and we endeavor to use such information carefully and sensibly. This page explains how the information you provide is collected and used.

**What Information Do We Collect?**  
We may collect both personally identifiable information about you and non-personally-identifiable information about your experience when you access the TagniFi website.

The personally identifiable information we collect on our website or through our service consists of information you submit to us, including your name, email address, and other personal information that you willingly provide. Because participation in these activities is voluntary, you have a choice whether or not to disclose such information.

In addition to information that you provide to us through forms, we receive non-personally identifiable information whenever you interact with our websites, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, geographical region, referral URLs, and other data automatically supplied by common web browsers.

**What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites?**  
When you use any TagniFi application associated with a Third-Party Site (“TPS”), including but not limited to social networking sites such as Facebook, we may collect personally identifiable information about you from the profile you have established at the TPS.

By authorizing TagniFi to access your TPS profile, you are authorizing TagniFi to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that your privacy settings at the TPS allow TagniFi to access through the TPS Application Programming Interface (“API”).

The personally identifiable information TagniFi is allowed to access is affected by the privacy settings you have established at the TPS. Because the linkage between any TPS and TagniFi is completely voluntary, and our ability to access your information at the TPS requires that linkage, you have a choice whether or not to disclose such information.

**How Is Your Information Used?**  
Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We do not sell, rent, or lease your information to third parties.

The information we obtain from TagniFi users helps us enhance and refine our service and content. Non-personal information collected about you through your experience and queries is used to better understand the entire population that is utilizing our website and how we might improve our services to improve the collective experience. Except as noted below, we track and record IP addresses that access our website for internal reporting, diagnostic, and analysis purposes only.

If you choose to receive communication from TagniFi directly or via use of any submission forms associated with the website, we may send you an email response as well as notify you of other offers or services that may be of interest. When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications to respond to you and improve our products and services.

Your IP address is used to determine, when possible, your approximate geographical location, which affects such things as your results’ default currency and units of measure, based on what country you are in. Your browser type may be used to fine-tune the results for optimal display, for example on mobile devices or to work around limitations of a particular browser. Referrer URLs may be used to generate usage statistics and analyze usage patterns.

**Other Disclosures of Your Information**  
We may release personally identifying information when we believe release is necessary to comply with lawful court orders. Any collected information associated with your use of the website (personal and non-personal) will be disclosed to government authorities or third parties only pursuant to a lawful request, subpoena, or other process that legally compels disclosure of that information.

We may also preserve, use, or disclose your information if necessary to enforce our Terms of Use and related agreements; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, including high-volume use of the website; to respond to support requests; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of TagniFi, our users, or others.

**Cookies**  
When you visit our website, we, like most websites, send one or more cookies—small anonymous identifiers—to your computer that uniquely identify you to our servers. While we do use cookies for security and fraud investigation purposes, our primary purpose is to enhance your user experience by understanding and remembering your preferences, and by general tracking of our user trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. Please be aware that TagniFi may not have full functionality if your browser refuses cookies. We utilize the following types of cookies:

1) Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide services that you have requested on our website.

2) Functional Cookies: These cookies support and facilitate your use of our website by enabling enhanced and personalized features.

3) Performance Cookies: These cookies collect information that we utilize to support the measurement of this website.

4) Targeting Cookies: These cookies are used by social sharing services (such as Facebook), and also by various third parties to deliver messaging that may be of value or interest to you. We do not have access to read or write such third-party cookies, nor do we directly control the manner in which they may be used.

**Links to Third-Party Websites**  
From time to time, TagniFi may contain links to other websites. We do not exercise any control over these websites, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices or content. We encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when following links from the TagniFi website. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by TagniFi.

**Accessing TagniFi from Third-Party Sources**  
TagniFi may additionally be accessed through web widgets or gadgets that are embedded on third-party sites, such as iGoogle. If you choose to access TagniFi via such tools, then depending on the third-party widget technology, your personal information and queries may be passed on to the third party’s servers prior to being processed on the TagniFi website.

**Security**  
We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of our website and systems. This includes precautions to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data.

Despite our efforts to protect your personal information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the internet may be intercepted. Your use of the website constitutes an acceptance of such risk.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**  
We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time in the future. Any such updates or modifications shall be effective immediately upon their posting. Please refer back to this page often for the latest information.
