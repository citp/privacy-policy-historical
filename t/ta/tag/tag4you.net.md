IPI is individually identifiable information about you that allows us to identify or contact you. Some of the Tag4You’s functions require asking you for certain IPI, such as your instagram username, instagram password and/or other personal information.

But we do not handle your Instagram passwords directly. We use Instagram's API and OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize Our users. Our databases are secured with passwords to guard against unauthorized access of Our systems. Only engineer staff members may access data on a need-to-know basis.

You may choose to provide IPI in order to access certain functions on the Tag4You. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but in that case it may be that you cannot use certain of the Tag4You’s functions.
