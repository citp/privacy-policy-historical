State law requires that users of this site be informed that this site collects information about users according to the following criteria.   The Texas A&M University System Health Science Center (HSC) respects your privacy.

Personal information that you provide via e-mail or through other online means will be used only for purposes necessary to serve your needs, such as responding to your inquiry or your request for general information. This may involve redirecting your inquiry or comment to another person or department better suited to meeting your needs or answering a specific question(s).

These groups would use the information to track the electronic interactions back to the source computer(s) or account(s).

Some HSC web pages may collect personal information about visitors and use that information for purposes other than those stated above. Each web page that collects such information will have a separate privacy statement that will tell you how that information is used.

## Open Records Policy

The Health Science Center is an institution of The Texas A&M University System. As such, it is bound by all of the Policies and Regulations of the A&M System. [Regulation 61.01.02](http://sago.tamu.edu/policy/61-01-02.htm), revised in March 2000, states all procedures and applications of the Texas Open Records Act for all institutions of the A&M System.

A link to the A&M System Policies and Regulations website is provided on the Health Science Center's homepage, and this site has a user-friendly search function for key words.
