Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi maintains this web site as an information resource and service for the public. In the course of providing you this information, we are able to gather and archive several types of data about visitors to our web site. In respect to your privacy and in accordance with State law, the following outlines how we handle those types of data.

**Personally Identifiable Information.**  Personal information that you provide via e-mail or through other online means will be used only to respond to your request or to analyze trends. This may involve redirecting your inquiry or comment to another person or department who is in a better position to answer your question or meet your needs.

The University accumulates data and keeps records to enable staff and faculty to plan educational opportunities to meet the needs of individual students, to better understand students, to counsel more effectively with them and to assist them in placement in graduate education or employment after graduation. Provisions are made for students to review and challenge the accuracy of records when appropriate and upon request. The University also complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and with the Texas Public Information Act.

Some directory information (e.g., home address, local address, local telephone number, etc.) given to the University is considered public information and will be released by the University upon request, in accordance with existing law. Someone who does not wish this public information to be released must notify the appropriate offices within the University.
