We respect your privacy. Not only do we respect it, but we also protect it. The private information you share with us stays with us. We do, however, provide or collect your information as is required by legislation to those to whom you have authorized us to release information. They include the financial institutions you've asked us to deal with, and specialized service providers (like the people who print our account statements). All of the above must meet our rigorous privacy standards. We've provided this content for your interest and information. This policy does have a legal tone that reflects both the importance of the issue and it is consistent with recent federal legislation. If you want more information regarding our privacy principles, please read on. 

If you have privacy questions or concerns, please contact one of our Associates at 1-800-464-3473. You can also contact our Privacy Officer by mail at 3389 Steeles Avenue East, Toronto, Ontario, M2H 3S8.
