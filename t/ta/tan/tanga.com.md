# Tanga's Privacy Policy - Tanga

Tanga respects your privacy. What you do behind closed doors, and in front of the open doors of your college dorm room is completely up to you. And we will not tell a soul, unless, of course, you post about it on our forums. What we collect from you allows us to ship product to you, use all of our Daily Fun and Social Entertainment features, make great improvements to our web site and give you a better, interactive experience.

Tanga will collect information such as your name, shipping and billing address, credit card number, email address, phone number and other pieces of info, from you so that we can complete your order, give you excellent customer service, allow you to participate in all of the Daily Fun activities, contests, puzzles and games and other forum features and also to send you out newsletters and other correspondence from Tanga.

Tanga sets cookies and accesses those cookies on your computer so you can make purchases and interact more dynamically with our web site. We also currently use Google Analytics to gather and combine traffic data so we can see what’s going on with our Web traffic.

From time to time, we will need to share information collected by us to help process your orders with shipping companies, credit card processors and occasionally TangaMonkey’s mother (so she knows he’s not hanging out with the wrong crowd again like in High School) or to provide data to help us and our business partners give you the best service available.

We will not, never, jamias, sell your personal information, email address, credit card info to any third party for their benefit.

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.

Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.
