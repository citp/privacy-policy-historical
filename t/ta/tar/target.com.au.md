### What Information we collect

We collect a range of information from our customers that is directly related to the products and services you choose. Where we wish to use the information for other purposes we will seek your agreement beforehand. The kind of personal information we collect can include: name, contact details, location, demographic information like gender, age, relationship status and so on, products you are interested in, where you shop, what you buy, who you shop for, where else you like to shop, what loyalty programs you belong to.

### How We Collect Information

As much as possible we collect information directly from our customers. We do this in a number of ways, including when you:

  * provide us with personal information over the phone or through personal mobile computing devices, like smart phones and tablets;
  * fill out application forms; or
  * submit your personal details through our website.



We also collect solicited personal information indirectly, through publicly available sources, or through social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter, Google and others, who disclose to their users that the users’ personal information is provided to businesses like Target. We may also collect or have access to personal information through our related companies such as Coles Group Limited. We do this where:

  * the customer has consented to such collection or would reasonably expect us to collect their personal information in this way, or
  * if it is necessary for a specific purpose such as the investigation of a privacy complaint



We usually only retain unsolicited information about our customers when dealing with a customer enquiry or complaint or where we conduct an investigation. For example, your image may be present on CCTV footage that also records a fall of another customer in one of our Stores.

### Using Personal Information

We use personal information to better understand our customers’ interests and needs, to complete purchase transactions and layby orders and to offer an ever improving quality range of amazing products.

We use personal information in the following ways:

  * Provide, deliver, source, administer, improve and personalise our products and services;
  * Process payments and provide refunds and discounts;
  * Enable our third party service providers to provide us with IT products and services, carry out product investigations, data processing, data analysis, business consulting, auditing, archiving, printing, delivery and mailing services;
  * Provide more relevant marketing offers through direct marketing, database compilation, market research, data analysis and segmentation, and the processing or creation of other marketing information;
  * Combine or compile with publicly available information for the processing or creation of marketing offers and information;
  * Personalising our customers shopping experience, including, where appropriate, identifying individuals;
  * Communicating with our customers, including product recalls and responding to queries and complaints;
  * Fraud prevention, including services regarding the protection of our customers’ information, eg. credit card information;
  * Develop and expand our operations to better suit our customers’ needs, such as planning for future store locations;
  * Maintaining and keeping our customers information current and as accurate as possible;

Where data is held overseas, we require third parties to store such data in restricted access premises and provide appropriate protection against unauthorised disclosure. As a minimum security requirement, password authentication is required to access those databases in all cases. We also use fire walls, SSL technology and encryption for transmission of data where appropriate.

When the personal information that we collect is no longer required, we destroy, delete or de-identify it in a secure manner, in accordance with Target’s Document Retention and Destruction Policy.

### Your Privacy choices

Where feasible, you can interact with Target anonymously or using a pseudonym. This will mean that there are some products and services that you will not be able to enjoy.
