For example, the information may include the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, and the type of browser you are using.

Target allows service providers and third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites and to use that information to serve ads for Target products or services or other companies' products or services when you visit target.ca or other websites. The information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) is used during your visits to Target's websites and other websites to provide advertisements about products and services that also may be of interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie or a web beacon to collect this information.
