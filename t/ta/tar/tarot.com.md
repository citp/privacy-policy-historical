# Tarot.com :: Tarot, Astrology, Numerology & I-Ching

Tarot.com uses passwords in order to customize and protect what are essentially private experiences. We collect personal information to allow us to personalize Horoscopes, Astrology and Numerology reports, Tarot and I-Ching readings – while also providing ways for you to customize your experience at the Tarot.com website. 

## We Adhere to a Strict Anti-Spam Policy

At Tarot.com we are 100% committed to protecting your privacy. We won't reveal or sell your email address to third parties. We won't send you emails if you don't want to receive them, either. 

When you first sign-up, we send out an email welcoming you and confirming your login name and password. Unless you choose to unsubscribe – which you can do from within that email -- you will also receive an occasional Special News email from Tarot.com. This is our way of notifying you about free readings, special gift offers, new reports or feature updates. You can easily unsubscribe from these at any time and still be able to receive horoscopes by email if you like. 

You can rest assured that Tarot.com will never share email addresses with anyone else. If you decide at any time that you want to stop receiving our member-benefits emails, you can opt-out by clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the end of every email or by visiting the "About You" area of the website. 

You may also control whether or not you subscribe to our Daily Horoscope newsletter, Weekly Romance Scope newsletter and any other content newsletters that may be offered in the future. This same privacy policy applies to those newsletters – in essence, we do not want to send you emails that you do not want – you are in control! 

If you are subscribed to our Special News list, we may also send out special offer emails on behalf of select partners and advertisers that we feel are of interest to our members. Each of these mailings will provide you with an easy way to unsubscribe. They will come from Tarot.com on behalf of these select third-parties – we will never share or sell your email address to anyone. You can opt-out of partner mailings while still continuing to receive Tarot.com special offers , horoscopes, newsletters, etc. If you choose to unsubscribe to any of our email lists, but in the future decide you would like to start receiving them again, you can easily re-subscribe under "About You" at any time. But until then, you can rest assured that we will honor your preference by removing your name from the internal lists that you specify. 

## Information Gathered for Customization & Purchasing

Tarot.com may gather information for the following reasons:

> **Customization/Preference Settings**  
>  Based on your chosen settings, you may access custom readings and other special features of the site without having to log in each time. Registrants will enjoy the benefits of customization, based on preferences they have specified to the website (for saved readings, one's favorite Tarot deck, etc.). 
> 
> **Product Purchases / Ecommerce**  
>  Purchasing online at Tarot.com is completely secure. The purchase of Karma Coins, Gift Certificates and Expert Readings requires no personal information other than name and credit card number, expiration date, etc. Our secure system stores some of this information for your convenience in the future, but no personal or financial information is ever shared, rented or sold. 
> 
> **Surveys**  
>  Demographic information that is accepted on a voluntary basis via surveys is stored anonymously and is not linked to individual records. 

## Your Personal Data Is Always Protected

We take extraordinary precautions to keep all customer information absolutely secure. We want you to be able to use our site as a personal resource for as long as you want, with complete confidence. Your unique user login and password protect your stored readings and reports, so that you – and only you – can access them anytime. 

> **Personal Online Journals**  
>  All full-sized readings and reports are saved for users in "Your Readings and Reports Journal", which you can find under the "About You" menu on every regular page of the website. This information – which consists of Tarot Readings, I-Ching Readings and Astrology and Numerology Reports – is saved for your convenience or analysis only, and any items in your Journal can be easily deleted by you anytime you want. These items are completely protected by your password and are not used by anyone else for any purpose.
