				<strong>TargetSolutions Privacy Policy </strong></h4>
			<p>
				Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.</p>
			<h5>
				<strong>Section 1. Our Commitment </strong></h5>
			<p>
				TargetSolutions and our affiliated companies worldwide (“TargetSolutions”) take your privacy seriously and are committed to respecting your online privacy. TargetSolutions recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you share with us. TargetSolutions has established this privacy policy statement (“Privacy Policy”) so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.</p>
			<h5>
				<strong>Section 2. Policy Coverage </strong></h5>
			<p>
				This policy covers how TargetSolutions treats personal information that TargetSolutions collects and receives about your use of our products and services. It also covers how personal information is used, shared, and how to request changes to the way the information is shared. Personal information is data that is not otherwise publicly available such as, but not limited to, your name, address, email address, or phone number and training data such as test scores, time spent in courses, and courses taken. In general you can visit TargetSolutions’ web marketing site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. This policy does not apply to companies that TargetSolutions does not own or control, or to people that TargetSolutions does not employ or manage.</p>
			<h5>
				<strong>Section 3. Information Collection </strong></h5>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Information Provided By You </small> </strong><br>
				Information will be collected when you provide it to TargetSolutions, such as when you request a demo, sign up for email newsletters, enter a contest or special offer, register for site membership, participate in questionnaires, surveys and profile data, or to otherwise communicate with us. Several of our services, such as taking safety training or running reports, require registration as a condition of use; when you register with one of our sites you are no longer anonymous. TargetSolutions is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the course of publicly accessible interaction or information that you choose to make public.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Information About You From Your Employer </small> </strong><br>
				Some of our services to employers require employee demographics. This information is provided by the employer and then stored on our servers at the request of the employer.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Information About You From Third Parties </small> </strong><br>
				We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies </small> </strong><br>
				Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a web site. They don’t tell us who you are unless you’ve specifically given us personally identifiable information. Cookies stored on your hard drive by a TargetSolutions site are not accessible to other sites. Like many other web sites, TargetSolutions sites use cookies to improve your experience with our online content. For example, we may use a cookie to identify members so they don’t have to re-enter a customer ID when they wish to login to our services. Cookies also help us improve your experience and deliver more relevant content to you. Cookies may be created directly by our sites for these purposes, or by third-party companies operating on our behalf. However, our cookies do not contain any information that is, in itself, personally identifying. Cookies may be required in order for you to participate in certain areas. If you choose to use TargetSolutions services, you must have cookies enabled to access any of the member-only related pages. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Web Site Traffic Information </small> </strong><br>
				Our website captures pertinent statistics, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser software and operating system types and versions, click-stream patterns, and pages accessed, and the dates and times of access. This is recorded in log files and is not accessible to third-parties.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Contests and Sweepstakes </small> </strong><br>
				TargetSolutions and websites periodically conducts contests and sweepstakes. If you choose to enter, the data you provide will be subject to the official rules of the specific contest, as well as this privacy policy. Please read the contest rules carefully before you submit your data.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Co-Branded Sites and Services </small> </strong><br>
				When you use a co-branded service within our network of sites, or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that service or site partner. Their use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy policies.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Customer Service Correspondence </small> </strong><br>
				In order to provide solutions to customers, we will often request identifying information in order to protect the privacy of the customer. This approach allows us to maintain a high-level of customer care and meets the needs of our customers quickly.</p>
			<h5>
				<strong>Section 4. Information Use and Disclosure </strong></h5>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Aggregate Statistics </small> </strong><br>
				The aggregate statistics that describe our online audience, which is often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites, helps us sell our product and publicize TargetSolutions and its brands. The information we share under these circumstances does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual reader or user, unless the individual has given us permission to share that information.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Email and Postal Mailing Lists </small> </strong><br>
				As a TargetSolutions customer, you can expect to receive relevant email and postal offers for TargetSolutions publications, seminars, events, web sites, and other services. Certain mailings are requested by your employer and are not subject to unsubscriptions through TargetSolutions. These email messages must be addressed with your employer directly. If you receive an email from us, that is not requested by your employer, and do not wish to receive other similar emails, simply click on the link bottom of the email. All of our contact information can be found at the end of this policy.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Change of Ownership of TargetSolutions, Inc. </small> </strong><br>
				The mailing list(s) associated with TargetSolutions may also be subject to transfer to another company in the event of a change of ownership. In this event, TargetSolutions or the new owner of the affected properties will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you and provide the opportunity to remove your name from the associated mailing list(s).</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Updating and Accessing Your Information </small> </strong><br>
				You can correct or change the information collected during site registration at any time at the profile page after logging in.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Disclosure to Third Parties </small> </strong><br>
				TargetSolutions does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
			<p>
				We provide the information to your employer at their request unless the information is marked as an anonymous submission. Your employer is considered as a trusted recipient of personal information. TargetSolutions cannot guarantee the security of your personal information once it is delivered to your employer as it is the responsibility of your employer to maintain this security. Please contact your employer for more details on how they use your personal information.</p>
			<p>
				We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</p>
			<p>
				We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of TargetSolutions’ terms of use, or as otherwise required by law;</p>
			<p>
				We transfer information about you if TargetSolutions is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, TargetSolutions will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
			<h5>
				<strong>Section 5. Your Consent </strong></h5>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Consent by Use </small> </strong><br>
				By using TargetSolutions’ products and services, you are consenting to the terms described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of our Privacy Policy, you may contact us with your suggestions or simply not use our products or services.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Children’s Privacy </small> </strong><br>
				TargetSolutions web sites are not intended for use by children, especially those under 13. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums, and chats. Minors under the age of 18 are prohibited from making purchases on our sites. If your children disclose information about themselves in our public discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, you should tell them not to do so.</p>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Privacy Policy Changes </small> </strong><br>
				TargetSolutions may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any modifications to our privacy policy will be reflected first on this page, so check back often. If there is a significant change, we will indicate on our sites that our privacy policy has changed and provide a link to the new policy.</p>
			<h5>
				<strong>Section 6. Questions and Suggestions </strong></h5>
			<p>
				<strong><small>Contact Us </small> </strong><br>
				Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area and TargetSolutions’ web sites are constantly evolving to meet these demands. If you have any questions or suggestions on our Privacy Policy, you can contact us. While we cannot guarantee privacy perfection, we will address any issue to the best of our abilities as soon as possible.</p>
