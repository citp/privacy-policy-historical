Some Tarrant County sites allow you to personalize them, either by selecting sets of content to place on a web page or by clicking on an icon indicating a desire for a certain kind of content. In some cases, you are asked to "register" in order to get this personalized content. If you provide personally identifying information when registering for personalized content, that information is used to deliver the content to you. The information is not shared with third parties. 

**Security**

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, Tarrant County web servers employ industry-standard methods to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on Tarrant County servers are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by law, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. 

In the specific context of this security monitoring, there is no expectation of privacy. However, only in the case of actual law enforcement investigations, will we attempt to identify individual users or their usage habits.
