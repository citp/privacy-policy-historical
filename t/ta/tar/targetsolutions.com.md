####  **TargetSolutions Privacy Policy**

Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

#####  **Section 1. Our Commitment**

TargetSolutions and our affiliated companies worldwide (“TargetSolutions”) take your privacy seriously and are committed to respecting your online privacy. TargetSolutions recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of any personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) you share with us. TargetSolutions has established this privacy policy statement (“Privacy Policy”) so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your Personal Information.

#####  **Section 2. Policy Coverage**

This policy covers how TargetSolutions treats personal information that TargetSolutions collects and receives about your use of our products and services. It also covers how personal information is used, shared, and how to request changes to the way the information is shared. Personal information is data that is not otherwise publicly available such as, but not limited to, your name, address, email address, or phone number and training data such as test scores, time spent in courses, and courses taken. In general you can visit TargetSolutions’ web marketing site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. This policy does not apply to companies that TargetSolutions does not own or control, or to people that TargetSolutions does not employ or manage.

#####  **Section 3. Information Collection**

**Information Provided By You **  
Information will be collected when you provide it to TargetSolutions, such as when you request a demo, sign up for email newsletters, enter a contest or special offer, register for site membership, participate in questionnaires, surveys and profile data, or to otherwise communicate with us. Several of our services, such as taking safety training or running reports, require registration as a condition of use; when you register with one of our sites you are no longer anonymous. TargetSolutions is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the course of publicly accessible interaction or information that you choose to make public.

**Information About You From Your Employer **  
Some of our services to employers require employee demographics. This information is provided by the employer and then stored on our servers at the request of the employer.

**Information About You From Third Parties **  
We may also receive information about you from other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.

Like many other web sites, TargetSolutions sites use cookies to improve your experience with our online content. For example, we may use a cookie to identify members so they don’t have to re-enter a customer ID when they wish to login to our services. Cookies also help us improve your experience and deliver more relevant content to you. Cookies may be created directly by our sites for these purposes, or by third-party companies operating on our behalf.

When you use a co-branded service within our network of sites, or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that service or site partner. Their use of your information is subject to their applicable privacy policies.
