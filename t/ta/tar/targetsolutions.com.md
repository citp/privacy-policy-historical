It also covers how personal information is used, shared, and how to request changes to the way the information is shared. Personal information includes information such as your name, address, email address, or phone number and training data such as test scores, time spent in courses, and courses taken. In general you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. This policy does not apply to companies that TargetSolutions does not own or control, or to people that TargetSolutions does not employ or manage.

Several of our services, such as taking safety training or running reports, require registration as a condition of use; when you register with our Sites you are no longer anonymous. TargetSolutions is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the course of publicly accessible interaction or information that you choose to make public.
