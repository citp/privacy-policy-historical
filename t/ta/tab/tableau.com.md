##  What Cookies and Web Beacons Are and How We and Others Use Them 

Our Site may use various software technologies including “cookies,” “web beacons” and “pixel tags.” “Cookies” are small text files that we and others may place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any PII. "Web beacons" or “Pixel tags” are small pieces of code placed on a web page or within the body of an email to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page or viewing or opening an email. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time for this and advertising purposes.

From time to time, we partner with third parties who may place cookies on your browser when you visit our Sites, may send their own cookies to your cookie file, and may use those cookies to track and collect information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites, devices, and applications and to provide targeted advertising based on your interests and previous browsing history.

Certain third party ad networks may automatically collect information about your visits to our Sites and other websites, such as your IP address, your Internet service provider, and the browser you use to visit our Sites. They do this using cookies, web beacons or other technologies. You can learn more about practices of many of these third parties by visiting the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) (<http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>) in the USA, [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/) (<http://youradchoices.ca/>) in Canada or the [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) (<http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/>) in Europe. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or web beacons and other technologies in third party advertising. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of third party advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies, web beacons and other technology. For more information about the cookies and related technologies used on our Sites, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20171229015200id_/https%3A//www.tableau.com/www.tableau.com/cookies "Tableau Cookie Ploicy") ([www.tableau.com/cookies/](https://www.tableau.com/cookies/)).

### What Internet Protocol Addresses Are

An Internet protocol (“IP”) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). Tableau may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, to prevent our servers from being abused and for other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

### Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors

Our Site contains third party sites linked from our Site to other Web sites, including those of our partners and sponsors, whose information practices may be different from ours. Sometimes these third party websites might conduct contests or sweepstakes and other activities that are promoted on our Site and visitors are directed away from our Site in order to participate in such activities.

You may also connect to third party services to share your information on and through their social media platforms, websites, applications, and services through “plug-ins,” widgets, buttons, and other third party features on and connected with our Sites. 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the activities of these third parties when they are collecting or using data for their own purpose or on behalf of others. Please consult the respective privacy policies and statements of such third parties for more information.

##  How We Secure and Store Your Information 

We have put in place reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to help safeguard information we collect through our Sites. However, you should know that no company, including Tableau, can fully eliminate security risks associated with PII. To help protect yourself, please use a strong password, do not use the same passwords to access your Tableau accounts that you use with other accounts or services, and protect your user names and passwords to help prevent others from accessing your accounts and services.

Tableau is a global company with affiliates, varied business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. Information collected by Tableau or on our behalf may be stored on your computers, on your mobile devices, or on our servers, and may be transferred to, accessed from, or stored and processed in, the United States and other countries including but not limited to Ireland, England, France, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Japan, and China, and any other country where Tableau or its service providers maintain facilities or support centers (a list of Tableau offices can be found here: <https://www.tableau.com/about/contact>), including jurisdictions that may not have data privacy laws that provide protections equivalent to those provided in your home country. However, we will protect all personal information we obtain in accordance with this Privacy Policy and take reasonable steps to ensure that it is treated lawfully. PII we collect may be retained for as long as needed to fulfill legitimate business purposes, including the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or for a period of time specifically required or allowed by applicable regulations or laws.

##  Use of Our Online Forums and Public Services 

We offer you the ability to post information and exchange ideas through our blogs and other online services such as Tableau Public. We may also offer ways to share through independent third party sites, plug-ins and online services. We are not responsible for the activities of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand how they user your information. Because your posts and information shared through Tableau Public are public and can be seen by others, we caution all users to consider what they post and share online and not to disclose any PII as part of their posts, even if requested to do so by other posters. Tableau will not be responsible in the event that you disclose PII in your posts, through our public services or during any other communication with other site users.

##  What Choices Do We Give You and How Can You Correct or Review Your Personal Information 

Our marketing emails tell you how to "opt-out" of receiving further marketing emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you, and, as allowed by applicable law, requests for your participation in surveys. You may also contact us [customerservice@tableau.com](mailto:customerservice@tableau.com) at any time to let us know that you no longer wish to receive further marketing emails.

Upon request, we will provide an individual with access to identifying information that we have collected about them (provided that they have given adequate proof of identity). We also offer individuals the ability to have inaccuracies corrected within their contact information. You may also request deletion of your PII. We will honor requests as required by law and subject to our business and legal needs to retain your data. These information requests can be made by sending us an e-mail through the e-mail link provided above or writing to us at the above mailing address.

##  Questions and Complaints 

If you believe Tableau maintains your personal data in one of the services within the scope of our Privacy Shield certification, you may direct any inquiries or complaints concerning our Privacy Shield compliance to [privacy@tableau.com](mailto:privacy@tableau.com). Tableau will respond within 45 days. If we fail to respond within that time, or if our response does not address your concern, you may contact JAMS, which provides an independent third-party dispute resolution body based in the United States, at <https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield>. JAMS has committed to respond to complaints and to provide appropriate recourse at no cost to you. If neither Tableau nor JAMS resolves your complaint, you may have the possibility to engage in binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.

If you have questions or suggestions, please email Tableau at [privacy@tableau.com](mailto:privacy@tableau.com). Written communication should be sent to Tableau Software, Inc., Attn: Tableau Legal, 1621 N 34th St., Seattle, Washington 98103 or The Oval, Shelbourne Road, Dublin 4, Ireland.

##  How We May Update Our Privacy Policy
