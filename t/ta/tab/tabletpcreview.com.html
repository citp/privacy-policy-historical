use or disclosure of personal information by TechTarget, you may send a written
notice of complaint to:</p>

<p class="subheading"><em><a name="section1" id="section1"></a></em>Key Definitions</p>
<p class="bodytext">In this Privacy Policy, we use the following key definitions.
Other terms are defined in the body of the policy.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Clickstream Data” means the information that TechTarget collects
through cookies, log files, beacons and clear GIFs, as described in Section 4
below.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Content Provider” means a third party that owns
a white paper, analyst report or other document and allows TechTarget to link
to or display that document on the Sites.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“User” or “you” means any person
viewing any page of the Sites.</p>
<p><span class="bodytext">“Third Party Content” means the white papers,
analyst reports and other documents available through the Sites and owned by
Content Providers.</span></p>
<p class="subheading"><em><a name="section2" id="section2"></a></em>This Privacy
Policy Does Not Apply To Third Party and Co-Branded Websites</p>
<p class="bodytext">Bitpipe.com 


 and KnowledgeStorm.com are two

of the properties within the TechTarget
network of sites. Bitpipe.com and KnowledgeStorm.com hosts thousands of white papers as well as white
paper Research Libraries on third party sites and other TechTarget properties.
Some Third Party Content made available through the Research Library sites is
maintained on the website of the Content Provider, and not on the TechTarget
network of sites. This means that when you click through to that Third Party
Content, you will be leaving the Research Library and the TechTarget network.
It will be clear to you when this happens, as the look and feel of your web page
will change, and the URL will no longer refer to a website in TechTarget network
of sites. This Privacy Policy does not govern the use and disclosure of any information
you choose to disclose to the Content Provider on the Content Provider site.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In addition, the Sites you are viewing may be co-branded,
meaning that the Sites are branded with the logos of both Bitpipe/KnowledgeStorm

 and a third
party (“Co-Branded Sites”). If you register or log in on a Co-Branded
Site, you are choosing to disclose information to both TechTarget and the third
party with whose brand the site is co-branded. This Privacy Policy only governs
TechTarget’s use of your information. The third party’s use of that
personal information is governed by the partner's privacy policy, and not by
this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="subheading"><em><a name="section3" id="section3"></a></em>What Information
Do We Collect?</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Profile Information</span>:
Our primary goal in collecting profile information (which may include your name
and the following business – and not home or personal – information:
title, address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address) is to provide you
with the best and most useful content and services, and to offer you opportunities
to obtain other products and services from us and our partners. Because we derive
revenue mainly from advertising, collecting information is essential to keeping
our services affordable to users.</p>
<p class="bodytext">We collect profile information when you provide it to us
through the following: when you register on one of our sites, subscribe to a
print magazine or an e-mail newsletter, register for one of our events or register
to use certain services (like webcasts and white papers) or through surveys as
well as when you register to receive a demonstration or test-drive for accounting
and business software through our site 2020software.com. Several of the services
that we offer on our sites may require registration as a condition of use. Once
you register with one of the TechTarget network of sites, including Bitpipe,



 KnowledgeStorm,

2020software.com and The ServerSide.com Community sites, you are no longer anonymous
to us. We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as
Dunn and Bradstreet, and add it to the information you provided to us.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Cookies</span>: When you
view the Sites, a small file called a cookie is placed on your hard drive. You
can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the
chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies,
some of our web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to
access certain information.) If you register as a member of TechTarget by providing
your name, email address and other contact details (a “Member”),
TechTarget will use cookies to authenticate your identity when you visit the
Sites and to personalize your user experience, such as by displaying your username
when you log on. In all cases, TechTarget uses cookies to obtain anonymous information
such as the number of visits to the Sites that a certain user has made, the movement
of the user through the Sites, and the searches that the user conducts on the
Sites.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Clear GIFs &amp; Servers</span>:
We use electronic images known as "clear GIFs" -- sometimes called "transparent
GIFs", "Web bugs", “pixel tags” or "beacons" --
that allow us to track general user traffic patterns (and not personally identifiable
information). TechTarget also automatically receives and records information
from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time,
and information about the page you requested (though these automatic updates
do not include your name or other profile information). </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Subscriber Information</span>:
If you subscribe to an email newsletter and become a “Subscriber”,
TechTarget collects your email address, password and areas of interest.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Member Information</span>:
If you register as a Member (such as by registering on a search site, subscribing
to a newsletter, 


 registering on KnowledgeStorm,

signing up for My Bitpipe or Library Membership or to access
a LeadIQ document and/ or requesting demos, brochures or other product information
from 2020software.com), TechTarget collects additional information, including
your name and corporate title, the name of your company and the department in
which you work, your industry group, country, zip code and telephone number (“Member
Details”). At the time you register to become a Member, or later when you
access a particular page or document, TechTarget may collect additional information,
including but not limited to: information about software or hardware your company
is using, plans your company may have to purchase additional information technology,
etc.. All of this information together is included in the definition of “Member
Details”. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Event Registration Information</span>:
When registering to attend a TechTarget event, the registration form requires
users to provide information such as name and corporate title, company name,
address, telephone and email address. TechTarget may also collect additional
information, including but not limited to: information about software or hardware
your company is using, plans your company may have to purchase additional information
technology, etc.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">LeadIQ Document Information</span>:
Some of the content found at the Sites or delivered to users by email consists
of interactive documents known as “LeadIQ Documents”. All LeadIQ
Documents are clearly labeled as such. Before you access a LeadIQ Document, you
are asked to register as a Member and provide Member Details as indicated above.
In addition, TechTarget tracks certain aspects of your use of the LeadIQ Document,
such as when you open the document, print the document, which pages of the document
are viewed, the time spent viewing them, information about your computer such
as host name and IP address. This “LeadIQ Activity Data” is stored
in a temporary file on your hard drive and also communicated to TechTarget.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Third Party Personal Information</span>:
The Sites include an “email a friend” feature, which allows a user
to email an article to a third party. The email addresses of third parties to
whom such articles or documents are emailed are the only third party personal
information collected at the Sites.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">2020software.com Registration
Information</span>: 2020software.com offers free demos and brochures for multiple
accounting and business software systems. Once a user registers to receive this
information, their registration information is shared with developers and/or
resellers of those accounting and business software systems. This information
is forwarded to the developer so that the user can receive the requested information. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytextbold">TechnologyGuide.com Registration Information</span>: TechnologyGuide.com consists of a family of websites including: Brighthand.com, NotebookReview.com, DigitalCameraReview.com, SpotStop.com and TabletPCReview.com. Each site publishes original content including product reviews, how to guides, news and editorials. TechnologyGuide.com also features user generated content in the form of a user review section and vibrant forum communities. In order to interact in the forums, a user must first complete the registration form. This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. And, the information provided by the user is also displayed in the user's public profile in our forums and can be viewed by all visitors of this website. However, to ensure total privacy of our users, we do not display a user e-mail addresses.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Supplementary Information</span>:
TechTarget may supplement Member Details with publicly available information
about a Member’s company. For example, if a Member indicates she works
for X Company, we may obtain information showing that X Company has a certain
number of employees and a certain estimated annual turnover. This information
is called “Supplementary Information”. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">System Information</span>:
TechTarget’s webcast application provides a system test that determines
whether you can view a webcast from your computer. This information is used to
optimize the viewing experience and to troubleshoot webcast viewing problems.
We do not collect or retain personally identifiable information in conducting
these tests.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Transaction Information</span>:
When you order paid Third Party Content from the Sites, we ask you to complete
an order form that requests certain information from you, including a credit
card number and expiration date and general contact details. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="boldcharactertext">Sharing Information</span>:
We aggregate profile information and disclose such information in a non-personally
identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional,
and other purposes. Except for the specific instances of information-sharing
described above, we do not disclose to third parties any information that could
be used to identify you personally.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Aggregated user statistics (for example, 25% of our users
are interested in Networking) are collected in order to describe our services
to prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. </p>
