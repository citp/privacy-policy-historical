_Effective Date:_ September 25, 2015

Taboola, Inc., together with its affiliates (“Taboola”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), recognizes the importance of privacy. In this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain through our websites, such as [www.taboola.com](http://www.taboola.com/) and [Taboola.fr](http://taboola.fr/) or any other Taboola website displaying this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Sites”), as well as our content-discovery platforms, widgets, analytics tools and other technical applications we may provide either through our Sites or through third-party websites (collectively, the “Services”). 

By visiting the Sites, using or interacting with any of our Services, you expressly consent that any information that we collect from or about you through our Sites or Services, including Personal Information, anonymous information, and aggregate information (collectively, “Information”), will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy.

The use we make of the Information, including Personal Information, collected through the Sites and Services may vary depending on whether you are (i) a Taboola customer ("Customer"), i.e., a publisher, advertiser or other content provider with whom we have a contractual relationship; (ii) a visitor of our Customers' websites interacting with our Services ("User"); or (iii) or a visitor of our own Taboola Sites ("Site Visitor"), which may include Customers as well as prospective customers. Therefore, we have distinguished the relevant information that relates to each of these target categories into three different sections below. Information that is relevant to all of these three categories is set forth in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.

Your use of our Sites or Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](http://www.taboola.com/terms-of-use-04162015), including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes.

Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to the recipient.

This enables the network advertising company to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Sites.

Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA consumer choice page, your opt out may not be effective.
