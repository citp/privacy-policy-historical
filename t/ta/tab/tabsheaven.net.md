This privacy policy applies to all the pages and micro-sites which appear under the **tabsHeaven.net** domain. We believe that the privacy of our visitors is of paramount importance, and will take every step to ensure that no one has access to any personally-identifiable information which will enable the tracking of our visitors' activities.

**tabsHeaven.net** is firmly committed to the privacy of our users, visitors, and mailing list members. Our advertisers and partners are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.

**Consumer Information**  
During your stay at **tabsHeaven.net** , we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address).

**tabsHeaven.net** may also feature contextual-advertising (sponsored text links) through our various partners, such as Google. We do not grant any personally-identifiable information to these partners except your IP address (assigned by your ISP). For most of our users, an IP address is temporarily assigned, and changes each time you log onto the Internet.  
**tabsHeaven.net** is able to provide you our free services because of the support of our advertisers and sponsorship partners.

**Third Party Cookies**  
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

We partner with ValueClick to serve ads and/or collect certain information when you visit our website. ValueClick may use cookies or web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information during your visit to this website in order to help show advertisements on other websites likely to be more interesting to you.

**Data Collection and Opt Out**  
**tabsHeaven.net** itself does not utilise cookies or any other means to collect personally-identifiable information about our visitors. We only utilise server-generated log reports to track our traffic, website usage, referring sites, and popular pages within the site for the sole purpose of maintenance of our network and for providing statistics to our advertisers, visitors and partners.  
At no time will **tabsHeaven.net** use any means to capture visitor e-mail addresses or personally-identifiable information of our visitors to sell or rent to any third-party, or for our own use, without the permission of our visitors. 

**Guitar PRO files**  
The aim of **tabsHeaven.net** is to transmit some useful resources for musicians that wish to improve their skills. Therefore, the content of the files is to be used for private study, scholarship or research only. Moreover, the goal is also to give to the guitarist a chance to make original arrangements of songs and to share them with other guitarists. Consequently, these tabs are a personal interpretation of a musical arrangement by a Guitar Pro user and do not intend to provide a precise tab of the artist. If you notice any Guitar Pro files with a copyright infraction, warn us and the file will be deleted.

We do not aspire to infringe copyrights, and we embolden you to purchase the artist's album and official song book.
