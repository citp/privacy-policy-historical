**Website Visitors**  
Like most internet-service operators, tawk.to collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers, apps and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, geographical location, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. tawk.to’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how tawk.to’s visitors use its services, and to provide tawk.to users the ability to understand how their visitors use their services. From time to time, tawk.to may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its services.

tawk.to also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users that use the services and visitors.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**  
Certain visitors to tawk.to’s websites and users of tawk.to’s apps choose to interact with tawk.to in ways that require tawk.to to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that tawk.to gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users of our app to provide an email address. In each case, tawk.to collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with tawk.to. tawk.to does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**  
tawk.to may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, tawk.to does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**  
tawk.to discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that:

  * (i) need to know that information in order to process it on tawk.to’s behalf or to provide services available at tawk.to’s webservices, and
  * (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using tawk.to’s webservices, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. tawk.to will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, tawk.to discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when tawk.to believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of tawk.to, third parties or the public at large.



If you are a registered user of tawk.to and have supplied your email address, tawk.to may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with tawk.to and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. tawk.to takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

If tawk.to, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that tawk.to goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of tawk.to may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
