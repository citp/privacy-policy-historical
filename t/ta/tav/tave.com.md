# Photography studio management software by Táve

March 16, 2008

At Táve we recognize that privacy is important. This policy applies to all of our products, services, and websites offered by Tave Corporation (collectively, Táve's "services").

If you have questions about this or any Táve policy, please [contact us](http://tave.com/?action=Contact) at any time.

### Information we collect and how we use it:

In order to provide our full range of services, we may collect the following types of information:

  * **Information you provide** \- When you sign up for a Táve account or other Táve service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). 
  * **Credit card information** \- While we store information relating to billing, such as your billing address and the last four digits of your credit card, _we do not store your full credit card number_. Instead, we request a special token from our merchant account provider that allows us to access, modify, or terminate the transaction or monthly reoccuring billing subscription without needing to store or for our staff to ever view your credit card information. For this reason, you will be required to provide your credit card with every new transaction.
  * **Táve cookies** \- When you visit Táve, we may send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people use the system. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, most Táve features and services will not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
  * **Log information** \- When you use Táve services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
  * **User communications** \- When you send email or other communication to Táve, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
  * **Affiliated sites** \- We offer some of our services in connection with other web sites. Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to Táve in order to deliver the service. We process such information in accordance with this Policy. The affiliated sites may have different privacy practices and we encourage you to read their privacy policies.



### Choices for personal information

When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.

If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Policy, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Policy, unless we have obtained your prior consent.

You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Táve may not be able to provide those services to you.

### Information sharing

Táve only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Táve in the following limited circumstances:

  * We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
  * We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Táve, its users or the public as required or permitted by law. 



If Táve becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information, such as how many users clicked on a particular link or use certain features. Such information does not identify you individually.

### Information security

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

We restrict access to personal information to Táve employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

### Data integrity

Táve processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Polic. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

### Accessing and updating personal information

When you use Táve services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup storage media), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.

### When your account is terminated

Users listed as a studio administrator may terminate a single user or request that their entire studio account be terminated. Táve may also terminate users and studios in accordance with the [Terms of Service](http://tave.com/?action=TermsOfService). Studio accounts terminated in good standing may be reactivated for a period of 90 days. After 90 days, Táve will delete the studio from its system and the account will not be recoverable, though data will still be retained on backup storage media as long as required to satisfy any applicable law or regulation.

### Enforcement

Táve regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or Táve's treatment of personal information by [contacting us](http://tave.com/?action=Contact) through this web site. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Táve's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Táve and an individual.

### Changes to this policy

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. 

If you have questions about this or any Táve policy, please [contact us](http://tave.com/?action=Contact) at any time.
