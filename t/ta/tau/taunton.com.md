**OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT**

We care about your privacy and want you to be informed about what we do. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share the information we receive about our clients and consumers and explains the options that are available to you. We’ll try to make this clear and simple, but if you have questions, you can contact us, and we’ll be happy to help. See the “Contact Us” section at the end of this document.

The Taunton Press, Inc. (“Taunton”, “us”, “our” or “we”) has developed this Privacy Policy to detail important information regarding the use and disclosure of user information collected on the websites that are owned and operated by Taunton.  These sites include, but are not limited to, finewoodworking.com, finehomebuilding.com, finegardening.com, finecooking.com, greenbuildingadvisor.com, threadsmagazine.com, tauntonstore.com and any successor websites (collectively and individually the “Site(s)”), and other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile applications (the Sites and other Taunton interactive properties are collectively referred to herein as the “Taunton Applications”).  This Privacy Policy also applies to our offline collection of information.  Thus, this Privacy Policy applies to your use of (1) Taunton Applications (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices, or otherwise); (2) Taunton email or electronic newsletters; (3) offline use, such as by telephone and traditional mail; and (4) any other means or applications on which you connect with us or our products and services.

This Privacy Policy found at _[_http://www.taunton.com/privacy-policy_](http://www.taunton.com/privacy-policy)_ is incorporated into and subject to Taunton’s [Terms of Use](http://www.taunton.com/terms-of-use).  Each time you access or use Taunton Applications you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the [Terms of Use](http://www.taunton.com/terms-of-use) and this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the [Terms of Use](http://www.taunton.com/terms-of-use) and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using Taunton Applications.

**To Users Resident in the European Economic Area:**   This Privacy Policy will govern use of your personal information if you choose to use any of the Taunton Applications.  However, your specific rights as European Union data subjects (“EU Data Rights”) are addressed below in the section titled, “ _Privacy Rights of Users in the European Economic Area (EEA_)“.

**HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION**

This section describes the kinds of personal information we collect about you in connection with your use of Taunton Applications.

**Information You Provide To Us**

  * **Contacting Us.** When you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity or otherwise sign up for our services or provide your contact information, including an email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product, or service, you agree that this action constitutes a transaction or inquiry establishing a business relationship with us.  You expressly consent to our communicating with you future information about Taunton using the information you provided to us.  You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you.  This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.  You may withdraw your consent to any or all of these communications at any time by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” button or other means offered in a communication, or by contacting us at _privacy@taunton.com._
  * **Registration Information.** We will collect personally identifiable information from you when you register for any Taunton membership sites, interact with our Taunton Applications, update your profile, interact with other users, and/or use various features of our Taunton Applications.  By signing up, you give us permission to store and display user information you have provided in order to provide the best possible experience on Taunton Applications.
  * **Billing Information.** We collect and store billing and credit card information.  This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit cards.
  * **Surveys and Promotions** **.** From time-to-time we may request information from you and other users via surveys, contests, or sweepstakes.  Participation in these surveys, contests, or sweepstakes is completely voluntary so you and other users have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code).  Contact information may be used to notify the winners, award prizes, and file winners’ information as required by law.  Survey information will be used for the purpose(s) of the survey, including the monitoring or improvement of the use and satisfaction of Taunton Applications.
  * **User Generated Content** **.**  Please remember that any information you disclose while participating on public e-mail services, chat areas, messaging or communication tools, or other interactive forums accessed through Taunton Applications, which are designed to facilitate your communication with others or post content on the Sites (“Communication Services”), becomes public information, becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by Taunton.  You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting.  There is no expectation of privacy when playing, posting, or otherwise participating on the Communication Services to protect the integrity of Taunton Applications and meet our obligations under applicable laws. If you post content, such as messages, photos, and videos please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that Taunton Application or Communication Service, and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.  We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services.  We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate.  Please review our [Terms of Use](http://www.taunton.com/terms-of-use) for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.



**Information Collected Through Technology**

In addition to any personally identifiable information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with Taunton Applications (“Usage Information”).  This may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to Taunton Applications, all of the areas within Taunton Applications that you visit, and the time of day, among other information.  We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including enhancing or otherwise improving Taunton Applications.  In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access Taunton Applications (any, a “Device”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access Taunton Applications, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier.  Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you.  Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personally identifiable information.  However, some information collected in this manner may be non-personally identifiable information, and may be used for analytical purposes only.

A few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:

**Cookies.**   A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site.  Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes and to make it easier to navigate the Site.  Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives.  We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Site and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Site easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings.  Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

We use cookies to enable functions on our website, personalize content and ads, provide social media features, and to analyze our website traffic.  We also share information about your use of our website with third party social media, advertising, and analytics organizations that may combine it with other information that you’ve provided to them or that they’ve collected from your use of their services.

The cookies we use fall into the following categories:

**Essential.**  These cookies help make our websites usable by enabling basic functions like page navigation and access to secure areas of the website.  The website cannot function properly without these cookies.

**Advertising.** ** ** These cookies allow us to know whether or not you’ve seen an advertisement or a type of advertisement, and how long it is since you’ve seen it. **  **We also use cookies for the purposes of targeted advertising.  We may use cookies set by a third party so we can more accurately target advertising to you.  For example, we may show an advertisement about woodworking tools if you have recently visited the tool section of our woodworking site.  These cookies are anonymous – they store information about what you are looking at on our site, but not who you are.

Some of the advertisements you see on our websites are provided by third party organizations.  Some of these organizations use their own anonymous cookies to track how many people have seen a particular ad, or to track how many people have seen it more than once.  The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies, which we do not have access to.  These organizations may use their cookies to anonymously target advertising to you on other websites, based on your visit to Taunton websites.

Social networking cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our websites through third party social networking and other websites.  These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.

**Analytics.** ** ** These cookies help us track site metrics and user behavior behind the scenes to improve and optimize our sites.  This data includes information about what pages were visited, what links were clicked, what terms were searched for, and provides information on the success of our marketing campaigns.  This data is used to help determine how our websites can be customized to provide a better user experience.  All of the information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works.

Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings.  To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set, visit [ _www.aboutcookies.org_](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [ _www.allaboutcookies.org_](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**Web Beacons.**  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.

**Embedded Script.**  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with Taunton Applications, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

**Information You Provide About a Third Party**

If you send someone else a communication from Taunton Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain consent from that person, or we explicitly say otherwise.  If that person becomes a subscriber to our publications, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other subscribers.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on Taunton Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.

**Information We Collect From Third Parties**  
We may acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or that we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.

**Third-Party Analytics Technologies**  
We use third-party analytics and other tools to better understand who is using Taunton Applications, how people are using Taunton Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of Taunton Applications and their content, and to help us serve more targeted content and advertising to you.  Those third-party companies may use cookies, pixel tags, or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the Taunton Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system and browser used, and other web sites you may have visited.  We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies.

Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), effective as of May 25, 2018, European Union data subjects are entitled to certain specific rights with respect to processing of their personal data.

The Taunton Applications are operated in the United States and are intended for users located in the United States.  However, we have developed policies and implemented practices to comply with regulations in the European Union and in Canada.  If you are located anywhere else outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States.  The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States.  By using Taunton Applications or by providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the United States.  You are also consenting to the application of United States federal and Connecticut state law in all matters concerning the Site and this Privacy Policy.

**Your Consent to Transfer Your Personal Information to Our Website** **.**   If you are visiting our site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information will be transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States where our servers and central databases are located.  By your agreement to use the Communication Services and acceptance of this Privacy Policy, you consent to such transfer of your personal information for use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**California Privacy Rights**

California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about their business practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
