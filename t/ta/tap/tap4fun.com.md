This section (“Your Rights”) applies to users that are located in the European Economic Area only.

You have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances (as set out in more detail below). We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (though this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To exercise any of your rights, please email us at [support@tap4fun.com](mailto:support@tap4fun.com).

1.Access

You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You can access the personal information you have made available as part of your account by logging into your Game account and by contacting [support@tap4fun.com](mailto:support@tap4fun.com). If you believe we hold any other personal information about you, please email us at [support@tap4fun.com](mailto:support@tap4fun.com).

You have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. This comprises any personal information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., certain survey information) or pursuant to our contract with you , as described in the section “How We Use Your Personal Information”. You have the right to receive this information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transfer that personal information to another party. 

If you wish for us to transfer such personal information to a third party, please ensure you detail that party in your request. Note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. Please note that we may not be able to provide you with personal information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g., where providing the personal information we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).

3.Correction

You have the right to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate. You can access the personal information you have made available as part of your account by logging into your Game account. If you believe we hold any other personal information about you and that information is inaccurate, please email us at [support@tap4fun.com](mailto:support@tap4fun.com).

You can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your Game account. If there is any other personal information you believe we process that you would like us to erase, please email us at [support@tap4fun.com](mailto:support@tap4fun.com).

You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you in the following circumstances:

  * you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold such personal information; or
  * you believe the personal information we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us. 



You can also exercise your right to restrict our processing of your personal information (as described below) whilst we consider your request. 

We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on the Game Services and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.

5.Restriction of Processing to Storage Only

You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). As above, where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too. 

You may request we stop processing and just store the personal information we hold about you where: 

  * you believe the personal information is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate;
  * you wish to erase the personal information as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to retain the personal information but just store it instead; or
