# Tapad - Privacy Policy

  * This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how Tapad, Inc. ("Tapad") collects and utilizes information. This Privacy Policy applies to the Tapad website at www.Tapad.com, (the "Tapad Site") and to the services offered by Tapad (the "Services"). Should you have any questions or concerns regarding the use or collection of information through the Services or on the Tapad Site, please send an email to privacy@Tapad.com.

### Collection of Information

Tapad collects the following types of information from the Services and Tapad Site.

A) Tapad Site and Services Registration Information.

We receive and store non-personally identifiable information from your visits to the Tapad Site such as browser type, session information, browser cookies, IP address, pages visited and clicks on content or advertisements we display. In addition, we may collect information you provide to us when you register for an account on the Tapad Site or provide us in any other way, such as by telephone or by electronic mail or by completing an advertiser or publisher questionnaire, which may include Personal Information. As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means information that specifically identifies a natural person (such as an individual's name, address, telephone number or e-mail address), and information about that natural person's activities or preferences when such information is directly linked to personal information. "Personal Information" does not include aggregate information, which is data collected by Tapad about a group or category of products, services, websites, mobile applications, TV applications or users, from which individual identities or other personally identifying information has been removed. This Privacy Policy does not restrict or limit Tapad's collection and use of aggregate information or non-Personal Information.

B) Information Collected Through The Use of Cookies and Related Technologies on the Tapad Advertising Network

Tapad may utilize cookies (including, with respect to mobile devices, standard mobile cookies that reside in the device's browser, and content cache cookies that reside in the device browser's content cache), web beacons, pixels, browser storage, and similar technologies to collect information about end users' visits to websites, mobile applications and TV applications (collectively, "Media") that participate in Tapad's advertising network and the interactions of such end users with advertisements on such Media. Tapad may also utilize HTML5 technology, which enables Tapad to store a unique identifier on a mobile device so that Tapad recognizes when an ad request has originated from a browser or application on such device. Tapad may match the unique identifier in a cookie or HTML5 database with the same unique identifier on Tapad's servers, on which Tapad stores the information it collects in connection with such unique identifier. The information collected by these technologies is non-Personal Information, and includes browser identifiers, session information, device type, carrier, IP address, device ID, carrier user ID, geo-location information, the request url (the URL that requests the ad which can contain within it information such as zip code, state, and country, if passed on to Tapad by its publisher partners), http headers from the ad requests coming from participating Media, which can contain standard data such as the types of file formats supported by a device, whether or not content can be cached on the device, sites and pages visited, and clicks on content and advertisements. 

C) Personal Information

Tapad may collect Personal Information on behalf of advertisers directly from end users, in instances where such end users choose to manually enter Personal Information as part of their interaction with an advertisement, and Tapad may periodically transfer such information to such advertisers. Tapad does not use Personal Information for telemarketing, or sell or rent such information to any third parties for their own use.

### How Collected Information is Used

Non-Personal Information may be used to provide reports to advertisers and publishers, to schedule, deliver and optimize advertisements, and to help Tapad display and customize advertisements to the interests or preferences of the visitors of the Media that participate in the Tapad advertising network. In addition, such information may be used by Tapad for internal analysis in order to perform and improve the Services and associated technologies, and to operate and improve the Tapad Site. Publisher and advertiser registration information may be used by Tapad to provide customer support to the applicable advertiser or publisher, and to send to such party account-related information, including invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support, administrative and promotional messages.

### Sharing of Information

    * Tapad may share Personal Information and non-Personal Information of publishers and advertisers with third party service providers engaged by Tapad to perform services on Tapad's behalf (for example, mailing vendors, payment processors). The purpose of such transfers includes the facilitation of advertisements and content that may be of interest to end users, and reporting on the performance of advertising campaigns. 
    * Protection of Tapad and Others: Tapad may release non-Personal Information and Personal Information when deemed necessary in order to comply with applicable laws or regulations; enforce or apply the Tapad Terms of Service, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Tapad, Tapad's customers, or others. 
    * Aggregate Information: Tapad may share aggregate information with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties in a manner that does not identify any particular advertiser, publisher or end user. 

### Information Security

Tapad takes reasonable measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, Tapad cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that Tapad receives.

### How to Opt Out of Tapad's Collection of Data

If you wish to opt out of Tapad's collection of data associated with your computer's browser, click on the link below using your computer's browser. If you wish to opt out of Tapad's collection of data associated with your mobile device's browser, click on the link below using your mobile device's browser.

[ Click here to opt out ](http://tap.tapad.com/opt-out?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tapad.com%2Fopted-out.html)

PLEASE NOTE: Do not just delete cookies or the Tapad HTML5 database from your mobile device, since this will not be an effective opt out. The Tapad opt-out works server side by flagging to Tapad's servers that a unique ID stored in the database or cookie has opted out. Thus, if you attempt to opt-out by clearing cookies, by deleting your device's content cache, or by deleting the Tapad HTML5 database, Tapad will not be able to recognize your device as having opted-out, and if you subsequently visit one of Tapad's website partners, you may then get a new database or cookie. 

Once implemented, the opt out will be effective for the life of the mobile device, unless you install a new browser, update your existing browser, delete Tapad's user ID cookie, delete the content cache, or delete the HTML5 database in the Tapad.com domain, in which case you will need to opt out again in order to maintain your opt out status.

Once you have opted out, Tapad will no longer collect information via your browser, and will not persist any identifying Tapad cookies on the device. Opting out as described above does not prevent third parties from collecting and sharing user data with Tapad. In order to stop third party tracking, users will need to participate in those third parties' opt out policies. Here is an example:

<http://www.admeld.com/privacy.html>

Please note that opting-out does not stop advertisements from being served to your device; rather, it prevents Tapad from associating non-Personal Information with your device's browser, starting from the time you opt out. It does not affect data collected prior to the opt out (although Tapad will no longer able to use any such data for purposes of targeting ads to you. See our retention policy below for how long we retain such data prior to archiving it).

### Retention of Data

Tapad retains information it has collected for so long as it is legitimately necessary for its business operations. If Tapad has not had any server interaction, such as serving an ad, with a device for more than sixty days, Tapad will archive and no longer use the data it has collected that is associated with such device, except for purposes of honoring opt-out requests by the user, and in an aggregate manner for internal analysis purposes. Unique IDs assigned to devices by third parties who pass such information to Tapad may continue to be passed to Tapad by such third parties in accordance with such third parties' data retention policies. 

### Changes

Tapad may modify this Privacy Policy at any time in its sole discretion. Use of information collected by Tapad now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. Changes to the Privacy Policy shall be announced by posting the updated Privacy Policy on the Tapad Site. Changes to this Policy will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
