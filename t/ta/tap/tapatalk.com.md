# Tapatalk - Privacy Policy

Tapatalk, Inc. ( **"Tapatalk"** , **"we"** , **"our"** , or **"us"** ), a Delaware corporation located in the United States of America, is an aggregator of websites and communications platforms ( **"Service"** ). Tapatalk operates the Service on http://www.tapatalk.com ( **"Website"** ) and on Tapatalk’s application available on various mobile operating systems and through the Website ( **"Application"** ).

This Privacy Policy describes Tapatalk’s collection, use and sharing of personally identifiable information ( **"PII"** ), which may include your first and last name, email address, that you voluntarily provide when using the Service through the Website or the Application. This Privacy Policy also explains how we collect, use and share information based on your interactions with the Service.

The Service is hosted in the United States and is available through our Website and the Application, and is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13). Tapatalk does not knowingly collect PII from individuals under thirteen (13) years of age. You authorize us to use the information collected in connection with your use of the Service as described in this Privacy Policy, which may involve transferring and storing such information across and outside your country to a country (such as a country outside of the European Economic Area) that may provide a different level of protection for such information.

**BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND, OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP USING THE SERVICE.**

**_PUBLIC SITES; FOLLOWING USERS AND THREADS; INVITE A FRIEND_**

Tapatalk makes websites, chat rooms, forums, message boards, blogs, RSS Feeds, and/or news groups (collectively, **"Sites"** ) available to users of the Service. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information on any such Site.

After you join a Site via the Service, Tapatalk may transmit information you provide or we gather (such as email address or information provided through your Facebook or Google + account if you use it as your Tapatalk login) to the requested Site. We do not store passwords on our servers except those provided by you for use with your Tapatalk account. If you use Facebook Login to log into the Application, we also collect and store certain information described below. 

We provide features in the Service that allow you to follow other users or Sites. These features will also allow other users to follow you or follow specific threads that you make via the Service. In the event that you do not want to allow other users to follow you or your threads, please visit the Settings section in the Application to make certain information private where available. In addition, we provide a feature for you to invite your friends to use the Service.

**_INFORMATION COLLECTED_**

We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by, for example, filling out a survey or registration form. To be clear, we do not collect any "sensitive personal data" as defined in the European Union. When you register with us to use the Service, you provide your name, email address, user name, password and other registration information. 

We also collect non-personally identifiable information ( **"Non-PII"** ) about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address and an anonymous device identifier, some of which may be considered "personal data" in some jurisdictions in the European Union and elsewhere, but none of this data identifies you individually. On the Website, Tapatalk may automatically gather Non-PII that browsers automatically make available, including IP addresses, domain servers, type of computer accessing the Website, and type of web browser accessing the Website. In addition, the Application collects certain Non-PII automatically, such as demographic and profile data, device ad identification, content viewed, and information that allows us to periodically determine your location, and mobile device and usage information, which may include (i) information about the way you use the Application, (ii) information specific to your mobile device (such as make, model, operating system, Internet browser, device IP address, anonymous device and/or advertising identifier and similar information), (iii) information about your use of features, functions, or notifications on the device, and (iv) signal strength relating to WiFi or Bluetooth functionality, temperature, battery level, and similar technical data. We may collect the foregoing information even if you are not logged in to the Application. For iOS users, you should be able to adjust the settings on your iOS device to prevent collection of location information by disabling the location services feature on your device. For Android users, you should be able to adjust your settings on your Android device to prevent collection of location information by disabling Bluetooth and location service features on your device. 

If you use Facebook Login or Google + to log into the Application, we collect and store certain additional information such as your birth date, likes, friends, etc. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share (or not share) certain PII and other information with us such as your name and email address to create a Tapatalk ID. Services like Facebook Login give you the option to post information about your Tapatalk activities to your Facebook profile page to share with others within your Facebook network.

If you choose to invite your friends to use the Service, your friend will receive an email request from the Service. You agree only to invite friends who you think would be interested in using the Service. Your friend may use the unsubscribe link in the footer of the invite to be removed from receiving future invites. 

**_USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION_**

Tapatalk does not sell or rent any PII you provide to us. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we only use the information you provide us for the purpose such information was provided. In addition, we may share your PII with our service providers to facilitate some aspects of the Service, such as to facilitate the sending of e-mails. These service providers may use your PII solely for the purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.

When you choose to follow a Site, we will send your name, username, and email to the applicable Site so that you become a member of that Site, and you agree to comply with the rules, regulations, end-user license agreement, and terms of service of each such Site. Your information may also be used by us to contact you when necessary in connection with the Service, which may include sending you periodic updates on trending discussions from the Sites you follow, if you receive a "like" for one of your posts to a Site, and/or if you were quoted in a post on a Site. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings from us by following the instructions set forth in the Email Opt-Out section below. 

The information we receive from your use of Facebook Login or Google + will be used to log you into the Application as described above. If you provide us information about your friends that you want to invite to use the Service, we will automatically send your friends an email inviting them to use the Service. Tapatalk stores this information to make sure your friends do not receive too many invites to join the Service from other Site users, and to enable your friends to unsubscribe from future emails.

Non-PII we receive from you and/or through your use of the Service will be used to tailor your experience with the Application, including showing you content we think you might be interested in, recommendations of Sites to follow, advertising, measuring advertising performance, and related research. Such Non-PII may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with other Non-PII such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android IDs), and also may be shared with advertisers and other third parties, including business partners such as advertising businesses who are obligated to comply with applicable laws concerning usage of the information, as well as our corporate affiliates, in connection with the Service (such third parties and affiliates collectively, **"Affiliates"** ). This information may also be used to deliver you information and/or promotional materials about our company and/or our Affiliates, including about products and services that may be of interest to you such as when you enter participating local venues of our Affiliates, to carry out other purposes that are disclosed to you and to which you consent, as well as by us for trend analysis, pattern detection, and site administration. In addition, our Affiliates may share this information with their own third-party business partners who may use the information either for themselves or on behalf of the applicable Affiliate, each only for the purposes set forth above. 

In addition, there may be other instances when Tapatalk may access or disclose PII or Non-PII, including under the following circumstances: (i) to protect or defend the legal rights or property of Tapatalk and/or our Affiliates; (ii) to protect the safety and security of users of the Service or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) to comply with applicable law, rules, regulations, or legal process. Further, if Tapatalk sells all or part of our business or sells or transfers all or a material part of our assets, or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of our business, we may transfer your PII or Non-PII to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.

**_USE OF COOKIES, BEACONS, AND PIXEL TAGS_**

When you use the Website we might store some information on your computer. This information may be in the form of a "cookie", "web beacon", or similar file. **"Cookies"** are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your computer’s hard drive for the purpose of identifying your browser during interaction on Websites. **"Web Beacons"** are invisible electronic images, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, which can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as a Cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web Beacon is placed. 

We use Cookies to deliver content and/or advertising specific to your interests, and to enable you to log into the Service without having to reenter all of your information. In addition, we may use an outside advertisement server company to display ads on the Website or Application. These ads may contain Cookies. The advertisement server company may collect Cookies received with outside banner ads. We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of Cookies by the advertisement server company. You can learn more about how to delete or control Cookies at [www.aboutcookies.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20170201061237id_/https%3A//www.tapatalk.com/www.aboutcookies.org). 

We may allow third parties to collect the anonymous data received from Cookies and Web Beacons on our behalf, and to retain and use this data themselves. In addition, we may share this anonymous data with other third parties. To protect your privacy, we do not use Cookies or Web Beacons to store or transmit any PII about you. You have the ability to accept or decline Cookies. Most web browsers and mobile devices automatically accept Cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s or mobile device’s setting to decline Cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline Cookies, certain features of the Service may not function properly or not at all. You may render some Web Beacons unusable by rejecting their associated Cookies.

From time to time, we may also place Cookies and Web Beacons on your computer or mobile device to collect anonymous data related to your use of our Website and your use of the Application, including Service usage analytics. 

**_ANALYTICS SERVICE PROVIDERS_**

We may allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include Web Beacons within the pages of our Website and anonymous identifiers on the Application. We may also share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, with these service providers for analytics purposes. These service providers aggregate information about what you see and interact with on our Website and on the Application.

These service providers offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective Websites. We allow Web Beacons from and share log file data with these service providers. To obtain a list of these service providers in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at privacy@tapatalk.com. 

None of the PII that you provide to us when using the Service is shared with our third party analytics service providers as part of our analytics programs.

**_ADVERTISEMENTS; AD NETWORKS; OTHER THIRD PARTIES_**

We may allow certain third-party companies to serve advertisements to you and collect anonymous information regarding your use of the Service. Typically, these companies are third party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content and research firms, and they may include Cookies and Web Beacons within our Website, or other tracking methodologies such as anonymous device identifiers on the Website and/or within the Application to collect anonymous information in order to provide customized content and/or ads, auditing, research and reporting for us, our partners, and advertisers when you visit certain pages of the Website or Application, and other websites or applications. For example, because your web browser must request these advertisements and/or web beacons from the third-party’s web servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own Cookies, just as if you had requested a webpage from their website directly. When you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that these companies will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisements. In addition, we or a data partner we have engaged may collect and store a unique identifier matched to your mobile device, in order to deliver customized ads or content while you use the Service or other websites or applications, or to seek to identify you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers. In order to customize these ads or content, we or our data partner may connect de-identified demographic or other data about you (received from third parties) either to data you voluntarily submitted to us (such as your email address), or to data passively collected from you (such as your device identifier or IP address). However, we will only share your email address with our data partners in hashed, non-human readable form.

The above third-party companies offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out of interest-based advertising, on their respective websites. To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at [privacy@tapatalk.com](mailto:privacy@tapatalk.com). You can also learn more about ad serving companies and opt-out capabilities at the [Network Advertising Initiative Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20170201061237id_/https%3A//www.tapatalk.com/Network%20Advertising%20Initiative%20Website) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance Website](https://web.archive.org/web/20170201061237id_/https%3A//www.tapatalk.com/Digital%20Advertising%20Alliance%20Website). 

Please note this does not opt you out of being served all advertising. If you use the Service after opting out, you will continue to receive generic advertisements. 

**_LINKS_**

The Service may contain links to websites or applications not operated by Tapatalk. The Service may also carry advertisements from third party companies not associated with Tapatalk. Tapatalk is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or applications or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Service or for the privacy practices of third party advertising companies. Once you leave the Service via a link, access a website, a third party application or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the website or application to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

**_WIDGETS_**

We may include a widget from a third party on the Website or Application that allows interaction or content sharing by users. **"Widgets"** are mini-programs (such as a Facebook "Share" or "Like" button) that provide specific services or content from a third party. The third party providing the Widget may offer controls for you to manage the Widget’s appearance and functionality. Your interaction with a Widget typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through the third party’s Cookies or its registration information. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its Widgets and Cookies even when you do not interact with the Widget. To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at [privacy@tapatalk.com](mailto:privacy@tapatalk.com).

**_DO NOT TRACK_**

Do Not Track ( **"DNT"** ) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. Tapatalk honors DNT settings in your browser, but will override such setting in the event that you turn on the "Remember Me" feature in the Service settings. If you want Tapatalk to fully honor DNT settings from your browser, visit settings and turn the "Remember Me" feature to the "Off" position.

**_SECURITY_**

Tapatalk uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural measures designed to safeguard PII in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. In addition, Tapatalk uses reasonable methods in an effort to make sure that the PII we store about you is consistent with the updated information you provide to us.

**_CLOSE OR MODIFY YOUR ACCOUNT; RETENTION OF INFORMATION_**

If you remove the Application or close your account, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is no longer accessible or used by the Service. However, we retain and may use your information as necessary to comply with our legal and/or financial obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and other legitimate business purposes (including, for document retention and security purposes). While we have limited capability to allow changes or modification of the information you previously provided to us, please email us at [privacy@tapatalk.com](mailto:privacy@tapatalk.com) for assistance.

**_EMAIL OPT OUT_**

You may opt-out of receiving communications from us, by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in the emails you receive from us. 

**_CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY_**

From time-to-time Tapatalk may modify this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, changes in the features of the Service or technology, and such modifications shall be effective upon posting by Tapatalk on our Website or in an update to the Application. 

Your continued use of the Service after Tapatalk posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, it is important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. 

If Tapatalk materially changes our practices regarding collection or use of your PII, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was collected unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the change. Our Privacy Policy was last updated on and is effective as of December 20, 2016.
