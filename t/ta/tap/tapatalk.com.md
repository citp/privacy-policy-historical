Tapatalk, Inc. (“ **Tapatalk** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **our** ,” or “ **us** ”), a Delaware corporation located in the United States of America, is an online and mobile aggregator of forums and communications platforms (“ **Service** ”). Tapatalk operates the Service on http://www.tapatalk.com (“ **Website** ”) and on Tapatalk’s mobile application available on various mobile operating systems (“ **Application** ”).

This Privacy Policy describes Tapatalk’s collection, use and sharing of personally identifiable information, which may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address, or telephone number, and the username and email address of your friends you invite to use the Service that you voluntarily provide when using the Service (“ **PII** ”) through the Website or the Application. This Privacy Policy also explains how we collect, use and share information based on your interactions with the Service. 

The Service is hosted in the United States and is available through our Website and the Application, and is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13). Tapatalk does not knowingly collect PII from individuals under thirteen (13) years of age. You authorize us to use the information collected in connection with your use of the Service as described in this Privacy Policy, which may involve transferring and storing such information across and outside your country to a country (such as a country outside of the European Economic Area) that may provide a different level of protection for such information.

BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND, OR DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP USING THE SERVICE.

PUBLIC FORUMS; FOLLOWING USERS AND THREADS; OPT-OUT; INVITE A FRIEND

Tapatalk makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to users of the Service. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information on any forum.

After you join a forum via the Service, Tapatalk may transmit information you provide or we gather (such as email address or information provided through your Facebook or GOOGLE + account if you use it as your Tapatalk forum login) to the requested forum. We do not store on our servers any email addresses, usernames or passwords except for those provided by you for use with your Tapatalk account, or the username and email address we obtain from the applicable forum if you utilize the invite a friend feature. If you use Log in with Facebook to login into the Application, we collect and store certain information described below. 

We provide features in the Service that allow you to follow other users, specific forums, sub-forums, or threads. These features will also allow other users to follow you or follow specific forum threads that you make via the Service. In the event that you do not want to allow other users to follow you or your forum threads, please visit the Settings section in the Application to make certain information private where available. In addition, we provide a feature for you to invite your friends to use the Service.

INFORMATION COLLECTED

When you register with us and use the Service, you provide your name, email address, user name, password and other registration information. We also collect non-personally identifiable information (“ **Non-PII** ”) about you in a number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP address and an anonymous device identifier, some of which may be considered “personal data” in some jurisdictions in the European Union and elsewhere, but none of this data identifies you individually. On the Website, Tapatalk may automatically gather Non-PII that browsers automatically make available, including IP addresses, domain servers, types of computers accessing the Website, and types of web browsers accessing the Website. In addition, the Application collects certain Non-PII automatically, including the type of mobile device, mobile operating system and mobile Internet browser you use, an anonymous mobile device identifier, the IP address of your mobile device, and information about the way you use the Application. This information will not identify you and is therefore considered Non-PII. We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily submit such information to us, by, for example, filling out a survey or registration form.  To be clear, we do not collect any “sensitive personal data” as defined in the European Union. 

If you use Log in with Facebook or GOOGLE + to login into the Application, we collect and store certain additional information such as your birthdate, likes, friends, etc. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share (or not share) certain PII and other information with us such as your name and email address to create a Tapatalk ID. Services like Log in with Facebook give you the option to post information about your Tapatalk forum activities to your Facebook profile page to share with others within your Facebook network.

If you choose to invite your friends to use the Service, your friend will receive an email request from the Service. You agree only to invite friends who you think would be interested in using the Service. Your friend may use the unsubscribe link in the footer of the invite to be removed from receiving future invites. 

USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION

In general, we will only use the information you provide to us for the purpose for which such information was provided. In addition, we may use certain information we receive if you use Log in with Facebook or GOOGLE + to login into the Application (as described above) and non-personal demographic and profile data we obtain through your use of the Service to tailor your experience on the Website or using the Application, including, showing you content we think you might be interested in, recommendations of forums to follow, and advertising. This information may also be shared with advertisers on an aggregated and Non-PII basis. If you provide us information about your friends that you want to invite to use the Service, we will automatically send your friend an email inviting him/her to use the Service. Tapatalk stores this information to make sure your friend does not receive too many invites to join the Service from other forum users, and to enable your friend to unsubscribe from future emails. 

The information, including PII, we receive from you and through your use of the Service may be used or shared by us with third parties, including marketing businesses, lead generation businesses, email service providers, our forum partners, and our corporate affiliates (collectively “ **Affiliates** ”). This information may be used to deliver you information about our company and promotional material from some of our Affiliates, including about products and services that may be of interest to you, as well as by us for trend analysis, pattern detection, and site administration. When you choose to follow a forum, we will send your name, username, and email to the applicable forum so that you become a member of that forum, and you agree to comply with the rules, regulations, end-user license agreement, and terms of service of each such forum. Your information may also be used to contact you when necessary. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings from us by following the instructions set forth in the Email Opt-Out section below. 

In addition, there may be other instances when Tapatalk may access or disclose PII or Non-PII, including under the following circumstances: (i) to protect or defend the legal rights or property of Tapatalk and its Affiliates; (ii) to protect the safety and security of users of the Service or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) to comply with applicable law or legal process. Further, if Tapatalk sells all or part of its business or sells or transfers all or a material part of its assets, or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, we may transfer your PII or Non-PII to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.

USE OF IP ADDRESSES

We use your IP Address or equivalent mobile geo-identifier to locate users by country; help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Service.

USE OF COOKIES, **** BEACONS, AND PIXEL TAGS

When you use the Website we might store some information on your computer. This information may be in the form of a "cookie" “web beacon” or similar file. “ **Cookies** ” are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your computer’s hard drive for the purpose of identifying your browser during interaction on Websites. “ **Web Beacons** ” are invisible electronic images, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear GIF, which can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as a Cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web Beacon is placed. 

We use Cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, including advertising and to enable you to from having to reenter all your registration data at each connection. We may use an outside advertisement server company to display ads on the Website or Application. These ads may contain Cookies. The advertisement server company may collect Cookies received with outside banner ads. We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies by the advertisement server company. You can learn more about how to delete or control Cookies at [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/). ****

We may allow third parties to collect the anonymous data received from Cookies and Web Beacons on our behalf, and to retain and use this data themselves. In addition, we may share this anonymous data with other third parties. To protect your privacy, we do not use Cookies or Web Beacons to store or transmit any PII about you. You have the ability to accept or decline Cookies. Most web browsers and mobile automatically accept Cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s or mobile device’s setting to decline Cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline Cookies, certain features of our Website may not function properly or not at all as a result. You may render some Web Beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.

From time to time, we may place Cookies and Web Beacons on your computer or mobile device to collect anonymous data related to your use of our Website and your use of the Application, including Service usage analytics, and content and advertising personalization. 

ANALYTICS SERVICE PROVIDERS

We may allow certain third-party analytics service providers to include web beacons within the pages of our Website and anonymous identifiers on the Application. We may also share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, with these service providers for analytics purposes. These service providers aggregate information about what you see and interact with on our Website and on the Application.

These service providers offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective Websites. We allow web beacons from and share log file data with these service providers. To obtain a list of these service providers in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at privacy@tapatalk.com. 

None of the PII that you provide to us when using the Service is shared with our third party analytics service providers as part of our analytics programs.

ADVERTISEMENTS; AD NETWORKS; OTHER THIRD PARTIES

We may allow certain third-party companies to serve advertisements to you and collect anonymous information regarding your use of the Service. Typically, these companies are third party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content and research firms, and they may include cookies and web beacons within our Website, or other tracking methodologies such as anonymous device identifiers on the Website and/or Application to collect anonymous information in order to provide customized content and/or ads, auditing, research and reporting for us, our partners, and advertisers when you visit certain pages of the Website or Application, and other websites or applications. For example, because your web browser must request these advertisements and/or web beacons from the third-party’s web servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a webpage from their website directly. When you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that these companies will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisements.

In addition, we or a data partner we have engaged may collect and store a unique identifier matched to your mobile device, in order to deliver customized ads or content while you use the Service or other websites or applications, or to seek to identify you in a unique manner across other devices or browsers. In order to customize these ads or content, we or our data partners may connect de-identified demographic or other data about you (received from third parties) either to data you voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), or to data passively collected from you (such as your device identifier or IP address). However, we will only share your email address with our data partner in hashed, non-human readable form.

The above third-party companies offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites. To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at [privacy@tapatalk.com](mailto:admin@tapatalk.com). You can also learn more about ad serving companies and opt-out capabilities at the [Network Advertising Initiative Website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance Website](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). 

Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. If you use the Service after opting out, you will continue to receive generic advertisements. 

LINKS

The Service may contain links to websites, forums, or applications not operated by Tapatalk. The Service may also carry advertisements from third party companies not associated with Tapatalk. Tapatalk is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites, forums, or applications or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with the Service or for the privacy practices of third party advertising companies. Once you leave the Service via such a link, access a forum, a third party application or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the forum, third party, or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

WIDGETS

We may include a widget from a third party on the Website or on the Application that allows interaction or content sharing by users. “ **Widgets** ” are mini-programs that provide specific services or content from a third party. These Widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, may be visible to you on a forum page or entry you visit. The third party providing the Widget may offer controls for you to manage the Widget’s appearance and functionality. Your interaction with a Widget typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through the third party’s cookies or its registration information. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its Widgets and cookies even when you do not interact with the Widget. To obtain a list of these third parties in order to request their privacy policy information and learn about the controls that may be available to you, please email us at [privacy@tapatalk.com](mailto:admin@tapatalk.com).

DO NOT TRACK

Do Not Track (“ **DNT** ”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. Tapatalk honors DNT settings in your browser, but will override such setting in the event that you turn on the “Remember Me” feature in the Service settings. If you want Tapatalk to fully honor DNT headings from your browser, visit settings and turn the “Remember Me” feature to the “Off” position.

SECURITY

Tapatalk uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical security measures designed to safeguard PII in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. In addition, Tapatalk uses reasonable methods in an effort to make sure that the PII we store about you is consistent with the updated information you provide to us. When we provide information to our third party advertising or analytics partners, any and all PII such as email addresses and mobile device identifiers are encrypted. 

CORRECT OR UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION

Tapatalk allows its users the option to change or modify information previously provided. This may be done through the following methods:

(1) e-mail the information to privacy@tapatalk.com   
(2) visit the Community Support section of the Website or in the Application and follow the appropriate instructions.

Unfortunately, to the extent that such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will reach the other databases. We will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from or corrected in our records.
