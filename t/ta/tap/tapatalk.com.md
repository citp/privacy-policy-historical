ADVERTISEMENTS, AD NETWORKS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES

We may allow certain third-party companies to serve advertisements to you and collect anonymous information regarding your use of the Service. Typically, these companies are third party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of sponsored content and research firms, and they may include a web beacon within our Website or other tracking methodologies such as anonymous device identifiers on the Application to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our partners, and advertisers. Although this may involve sharing of some PII elements, it will be shared only in an encrypted, anonymized form. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and/or web beacons from the third-party’s web servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a webpage from their Website directly. These companies may also use these cookies or web beacons to collect information on the Website pages we host to deliver you customized content and/or ads on both this and other Websites.

We may customize some ads tailored to your interests when you visit certain pages of the Website and the Application, but we do not provide any unencrypted PII to an advertiser when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the possibility exists that the advertiser will make the assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisements.

The following third parties offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites (click to visit their websites).

These Widgets, such as a Facebook “Share” or “Like” button, may be visible to you on a forum page or entry you visit. The third party providing the Widget may offer controls for you to manage the Widget’s appearance and functionality. Your interaction with a Widget typically allows the third party to collect some information about you through the third party’s cookies or its registration information. In some cases, the third party may recognize you through its Widgets and cookies even when you do not interact with the Widget.
