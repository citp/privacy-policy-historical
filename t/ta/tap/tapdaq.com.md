We are a company registered in England, our registered office address is at Third Floor, 29 – 30 Ely Place, London, EC1N 6TD. Our Company Number is 08309095.

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors and service users. Our Privacy Policy tells you how we look after, use and share the Personal Information that we collect from you. Whilst we do not apply a different standard of data protection to our users based on location, some of the rights set out below won’t apply to you if you’re not located in the EU.

We collect different types of Personal Information from Ad Networks, Publishers and users of Apps which have the Tapdaq SDK installed (" **User** "). Our Privacy Policy may apply in different ways to each type of Personal Information. Please read this policy carefully. In addition, our website uses essential cookies. You can read more about cookies below.

## 2\. How do we protect your Personal Information?

We take your privacy seriously and use secure servers to store your Personal Information. We use industry standard organisational and technical security measures to protect your data against unauthorised disclosure, loss, misuse, alteration or processing. However, like everyone else, we cannot guarantee complete security, especially when data is sent over the internet.

You must ensure that your password cannot be guessed, either by a person or a computer programme. Limit access to your computer or device and sign off after you have finished accessing your account. If you think that someone has access to your password or unauthorised access to your account, please inform us immediately.

We collect Personal Information that you provide to us when you register and open an account: This includes your full name, email address, company name, company website, username, password, Network account keys, business address, App name and App details and any other information that you supply to us.

The legal basis for our processing is in order to fulfil our contract with you, manage our business relationship, to provide the Services and to assist you in getting the most out of our Services (in other words, our legitimate business interests).

You may choose whether or not to give some information to us. However, if you have not given us some information, you may not be able to enjoy all or parts of the Services offered.
