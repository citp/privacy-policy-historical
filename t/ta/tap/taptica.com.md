**Privacy Statement**

The Company, including its direct and/or indirect subsidiaries and affiliates which include the platform and services for Taptica (the “Company”, “We”), its respective website (the “Website”) and the services and technologies they provide (the “Service” or “Platform”) has a strong commitment to protect the privacy of its users. Our privacy policy aims to ensure the protection of privacy of our users and to provide them with control over the decision how their information is being used.

**Acceptance of Terms**

The Privacy Policy should be read together with the Terms of Use http://taptica.com/termsandconditions/ which together comprise of the full agreement between the Company and its users.

**What this Policy Covers**

This policy covers Advertisers and Affiliates. Our platform enables brands and app developers to engage valuable mobile users. Our technology utilizes a programmatic media-buying platform that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to improve marketing ROI by finding the right users at the right time for the right campaign. This Privacy Policy explains how we treat users’privacy, so You may decide whether to useour Platform, including how You may opt-out. This policy does not cover the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage, including any tracking technologies placed from outside our services.

**Information Collection**

To help Company personalize the advertising, to enhance ad effectiveness and relevancy, improve our Services and Platform, create new products, conduct research, and provide reporting for internal and external clients, we are required to use tracking technologies, to collect information about the way in which users may respond to, select and interact with an ad or any content provided therein, analyze usage patterns and record Your browsing activity.

The tracking technologies are accessed to collect and send statistical information when a user uses the Platform. To serve our ads in mobile applications we collect identifiers, such as Android Id or IDFA depending on the operating system of Your mobile device based on Your policy. These identifiers consist of a string of anonymous and random characters singling out Your device that Company stored by Company with a hash (non reversible encrypting method).

We only use these tracking technologies to better target and analyze consumer behavior with the goal of enabling us to provide our clients better and more relevant advertising.

WE DO NOT USE TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES TO PROCESS OR COLLECT ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. For purposes of this document, personally identifying information (PII) is information that personally identifies You and that is not otherwise publicly available, such as Your first and last name, social security or identification number, credit card number, phone number, or email address. We use tracking technology for non-PII only, which is information that cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity, such as Yourmobile device and/or computer’s configuration, and the version and type of browser You are using. While some non-PII could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify a user (e.g., the address of a web page or of a computer on the Internet could identify a user when combined with Internet service provider records), we ourselves generally have no way of tying any of the information we collect back to a particular user, and in the unusual circumstance that we could use an Internet protocol address for such purposes, we do not do so unless required by law.

**The Information We Collect**

We may collect only anonymous data through anonymous tracking technologies that record such asevents related to Your activity that may include socio-demographic data such as age range, information related to Your device (device type, operating system, version) and events related to the platform activity.

**How We Use that Information**

We do not rent or sell any information about You to others, or trade any such information. We may share aggregate information, and other non-PII information about You for various purposes, such as to perform or enhance our services. We may also share any information (including to personally identify a user) with our affiliates or service providers, in response to any request by authorities that we believe legally compels us to respond, to establish or exercise legal rights or defend against legal claims, to investigate, prevent, or take action for violations of our terms of service, or as otherwise required by law.

**International & Data Internet-based Transfer**

We use the Internet to collect and process personal data. It necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.

Your information may be stored and processed in the United States and Israel or any other country where the Company has facilities

**Your Ability to Edit/Delete Your Information**

Because we do not collect PII, and the information we obtain is automatic through tracking technologies, We cannot provide You the ability to edit or update Your non-PII information after it is collected. You can always opt-out though. If You opt-out from tracking technologies, any information that We already have collected or stored may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after Your deletion request. This may be the case even though no more information remains in our active databases.
