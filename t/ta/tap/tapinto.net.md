# Privacy Policy - TAPinto

**PRIVACY POLICY**  
for TAPinto.net

TAPinto.net, hereinafter referred to as TAP ("TAP") is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of visitors to our Web site (the "Site") as well as the privacy of users of the Site. As part of our commitment to protecting your privacy online, we have written this policy to help you understand how we gather information about users of the Site, how we use the information we gather and what steps we take to protect the information you share with us.

For visitors, we've structured the Site so that, in general, you can visit us on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.

If and when you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with TAP.

**What information do we collect?**  
When you sign up for TAP’s services and/or make a donation, you provide us with both contact and/or payment information. Contact information typically includes your name, address, email address and phone number. Payment information typically includes your credit card number.

We manage information with regard to your account status, choice of services, and customer logs. In addition, we may store customers' electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the transmission and delivery of those communications.

**How do we use this information?**  
We use the contact information you provide us to provide or enhance our service to you. We create and maintain other information such as customer account status, choice of services, and customer logs in the normal course of providing service. TAP may share customer information with selected partners and/or third parties, for example, to provide you with information about products or services which might be of interest to you or to enable you to take advantage of special partner programs. You may instruct us at any time not to share your personal information with third parties by sending us an email message at [contact@tapinto.net](mailto:contact@tapinto.net).

We will not disclose a customer's personal information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of TAP, our customers, or others, or where TAP has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.

TAP also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that TAP stores or transmits for its customers. The circumstances under which TAP will disclose such electronic customer communications are when:

  * It helps us to provide service to the customer;

  * It is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of TAP or its users;

  * It is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants, or other legal process that TAP determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; or

  * It is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by TAP and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.




TAP retains the right to censor, edit or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. TAP reserves the right, however, to review, delete or block access to communications that may harm TAP, its customers or third parties. The grounds on which TAP may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of the Site's Terms and Conditions.

We provide users the opportunity to opt out of receiving any further communications from us when they receive emails from us. We also give users the option of contacting us at any time to remove their information from our database or to stop future distributions to them of email updates or other information.

You can opt out of any feature by sending an email to [contact@tapinto.net](mailto:contact@tapinto.net), or you can send mail to the following postal address:  
**TAP Into LLC**  
P.O. Box 794  
New Providence, NJ 07974  
Attn: Website Coordinator

We also give you the option of changing or modifying any information you have previously provided to us. To do so, you should send an email to contact@tapinto.net, or contact the address above.

Despite our reasonable precautions to protect your information from loss, misuse or alteration, you should recognize that there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet. To help us protect your privacy, you should maintain the secrecy of any password you set up in registering for TAP’s service or making purchases or donations on the Site.

**Accuracy and Security of Personal Information**  
TAP uses encryption technology to safeguard your credit card data used in electronic transactions. Any personal information you provide to TAP is kept on secure servers. TAP uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures (a) to safeguard personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification; and (b) to ensure the integrity of the personal information.

TAP disclaims any and all liability should the reasonable measures used by TAP to protect your private and personal information fail. TAP is not liable or responsible for any conduct by third parties, including conduct that results in theft and/or dissemination of your personal and/or private information.

To enhance your experience with TAP, our server uses "cookies" to store user's preferences. Cookies are messages sent between TAP and your browser which are saved as text files on your computer. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, requesting email alerts or additional information. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in cookies.

If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from TAP Web site, it is possible that some parts of the Site will not function properly, and you will not be able to experience personalized visits to TAP Web site or subscribe to any service offerings on the Site.

**Policy Governs Use; Changes to Privacy Policy**  
The terms of this policy will govern the use and any information collected while it is in place. TAP reserves the right to change this policy at any time by posting revisions on the Site.
