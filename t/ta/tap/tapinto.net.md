As part of our commitment to protecting your privacy online, we have written this policy to help you understand how we gather information about users of the Site, how we use the information we gather and what steps we take to protect the information you share with us.

For visitors, we've structured the Site so that, in general, you can visit us on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.

If and when you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC.

**How do we use this information?**  
We use the contact information you provide us to provide or enhance our service to you. We create and maintain other information such as customer account status, choice of services, and customer logs in the normal course of providing service. THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC may share customer information with selected partners and/or third parties, for example, to provide you with information about products or services which might be of interest to you or to enable you to take advantage of special partner programs. You may instruct us at any time not to share your personal information with third parties by sending us an email message at [contact@tapinto.net](mailto:contact@tapinto.net).

We will not disclose a customer's personal information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC, our customers, or others, or where THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.

THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC stores or transmits for its customers.

  * It is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC or its users;
  * It is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants, or other legal process that THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; or
  * It is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.



THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC retains the right to censor, edit or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC reserves the right, however, to review, delete or block access to communications that may harm THE ALTERNATIVE PRESS LLC, its customers or third parties.
