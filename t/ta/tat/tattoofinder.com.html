              TattooFinder.com provides the highest-quality tattoo artwork available 
              as individual designs for sale on the Internet. All designs we sell 
              are scanned from original artwork, digitally enhanced, cleaned, 
              and posted for download/print.</p>
            <p><b>WHY BUY A TATTOO DESIGN FROM TATTOOFINDER.COM?</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Quality</b>: All designs sold on TattooFinder are by top 
                artists from around the world, and the best up &amp; coming artists 
                in the industry. Much of the artwork on TattooFinder.com is also 
                sold as sets of tattoo flash to tattoo studios on Flash2xs.com. 
                This is the same top quality artwork that you would find displayed 
                on the walls of tattoo studios worldwide. Unlike a tattoo studio 
                however, the size of our collection is not limited to wall space. 
                Our goal is to provide more top quality designs on TattooFinder.com 
                than can be found anywhere.</li>
              <li><b>Ease of finding a perfect design</b>: TattooFinder.com features 
                the most advanced search engine on the Internet for finding tattoo 
                designs. We are constantly adding new designs. The gallery on 
                the site allows you to bookmark designs for your consideration, 
                or send them to your friends to get their opinions. TattooFinder.com 
                allows you to search by artist, color or black &amp; gray designs, 
                the date a design was added, size and an intelligent keyword system 
                that automatically updates itself as searches are performed. </li>
              <li><b>All artwork is tattooable</b>: Some artwork is tattooable, 
                some is not. Skin is a living canvas that changes over time. A 
                tattoo artist may put something on your skin just to make the 
                sale even if it won't hold up over time. All designs on TattooFinder.com 
                have been evaluated by reputable tattoo artists to ensure that 
                they will work as a great tattoo design. </li>
              <li><b>Line drawings</b>: Most people aren't aware of what line 
                drawings are used for. Line drawings are what the tattoo artist 
                will use to transfer the outlines of the design to your skin. 
                All artwork on TattooFinder.com is sold with line drawings. If 
                you bring a design into a studio without lines, the tattoo artist 
                will add the time it takes to create them into the price of the 
                tattoo. At the end, buying a design on TattooFinder.com can actually 
                save you money on the price of your tattoo.</li>

              The Internet contains a wealth of information; unfortunately, it 
              may also contain personal details about you that you don't want 
              everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on 
              the Internet use aliases, alter egos, or nicknames), street address, 
              phone number, or e-mail address. When you go online, sites you visit 
              may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. At 
              TattooFinder.com, we strive to help our customers protect their 
              privacy while using our services.</p>
            <p>TattooFinder.com's policy is to respect and protect the privacy 
              of our users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information 
              from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience 
              and we want to help you make it so. Be assured that TattooFinder.com 
              will not disclose your personal information to third parties without 
              your consent. TattooFinder.com may disclose user information in 
              special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this 
              information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action 
              against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with 
              (either intentionally or unintentionally) TattooFinder.com's rights 
              or property, other TattooFinder.com users, or anyone else that could 
              be harmed by such activities. TattooFinder.com may disclose user 
              information when we believe in good faith that the law requires 
              it. TattooFinder.com shares aggregate information about our users 
              with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. 
              For example, we will say TattooFinder.com's audience is x percent 
              female and y percent male. This data is used to customize TattooFinder.com's 
              content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users. 
              There are cases where TattooFinder.com may ask you for personal 
              information such as your name, e-mail address, and birth date. For 
              example, we request personal information when you make a purchase 
              with TattooFinder.com. TattooFinder.com needs to collect this information 
              for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with TattooFinder.com 
              policies as well as federal, state, and local laws, and/or for editorial

              or some personal information changes (such as your ZIP code), we 
              will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove the 
              personal data you give us.</p>
            <p><b>POLICIES FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE)</b></p>
            <p>TattooFinder.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time 
              online with their children and to participate in the activities 
              offered on the sites. No information should be submitted to or posted 
              at TattooFinder.com by Guests under 13 years of age without the 
              consent of their parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed 
              during collection, TattooFinder.com does not provide any personally 
              identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third 
              party for any purpose whatsoever from our Guests under 13 years 
              of age. All registrants receive an e-mail confirming their Registration. 
              In addition, when a Guest under 13 registers, he/she is required 
              to provide the e-mail address of his/her parent or guardian and 
              that parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that 
              Registration. Although Guests under 13 years of age may be allowed 
              to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a Guest 
              wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parent or guardian 
              identified in the initial registration process. Publication of names, 
              ages, or images for contest winners under 13 require parental or 
              guardian consent.</p>
            <p><b>POLICIES FOR TEENS (INDIVIDUALS 13 TO 17 YEARS OF AGE)</b></p>
            <p>Teens are required to provide the e-mail address of a parent or 
              guardian and a notification message is sent to the parent or guardian 
              of all Guests who are 13 to 17 years of age, which identifies the 
              information supplied at Registration and allows the parent or guardian 
              to be aware of and participate in the Guest's online experience.</p>
            <p><b>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</b></p>
            <p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your 
              computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big 
              computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify 
              your computer by its IP address. TattooFinder.com collects IP addresses 
              for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information 
              to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When Guests 
              request pages from TattooFinder.com, our servers log the Guests' 
              IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally 
              identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, 
              but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses 
              to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance 
              with our rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, 
              customers, or others. Some services within TattooFinder.com, such 
              as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the 
              message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior 
              to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable 
              with sharing.</p>

              are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to 
              the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and 
              pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 
              We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored 
              to our users needs. Visitors to TattooFinder.com always have the 
              option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Most 
              browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your 
              browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being 
              sent. However, note that some parts of the TattooFinder.com service 
              will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you 
              refuse cookies.</p>
            <p><b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</b></p>
            <p>Users should be aware that when they are on TattooFinder.com, they 
              could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There 
              are links to other sites from TattooFinder.com pages that take you 
              outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a 
              banner advertisement, the "click" takes you off the TattooFinder.com 
              site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors, and partners 
              that may use TattooFinder.com's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. 
              These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, 
              or solicit personal information. Please keep in mind that whenever 
              you give out personal information online --- for example, via message 
              boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by 
              people you don't know. While TattooFinder.com strives to protect 
              their users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee 
              the security of any information you disclose online and you do so 
              at your own risk. TattooFinder.com's policy does not extend to anything 
              that is inherent in the operation of the<br>
              Internet, and therefore beyond TattooFinder.com's control, and is 
              not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental 
              regulation.</p>
            <p><b>THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING</b></p>
            <p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. 
            These companies may use some of the above discussed information (not including your 
            name, address, email address, payment information, or telephone number) about your 
            visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and 
            services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice 
            and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,

            <p><b>SECURITY</b></p>
            <p>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information 
              associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise 
              great care in providing secure transmission of your information 
              from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission 
              over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, 
              while we strive to protect your personal information, TattooFinder.com 
              can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit 
              to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at 
              your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best 
              effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information 
              is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) 
              encryption. TattooFinder.com will never ask you for your password 
              in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, you are responsible 
              for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.</p>
            <p><b>YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS</b></p>
            <p>By using this site, you signify your assent to the TattooFinder.com 
              Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not 
              use our site. Your continued use of the TattooFinder.com site following 
              the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those 
              changes.</p>
            <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Web site's privacy 
              statement, you should first contact the company as follows: TattooFinder.com, 
              2734 West 28th Ave. - Denver, Colorado - 80211; telephone number: 
              (303) 774-0208; or via e-mail.</p>
            <p><b>TattooFinder.com's INTERNET SAFETY TIPS</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep your passwords private, even from your best friend! Your 
                online service will never ask for them, so neither should anyone 
                else.</li>
              <li>Use only your member name and/or e-mail address when chatting 
                or sending e-mail.</li>
              <li>Never give out personal information like your name, address, 
                or phone number.</li>
              <li>Don't share photos of yourself, your family, or your home with 
                people you meet online.</li>
              <li>Always delete unknown e-mail attachments without opening them. 
                They can contain destructive viruses. </li>
              <li>If a person writes something that is mean or makes you feel 
                uncomfortable, don't respond. Just log off and tell your parents, 
                who can report it to your online service provider.</li>
              <li>Remember that nothing you write on the Web is completely private 
                -- including e-mail. So be careful and think about what you type 
                and who you tell. Not everyone is as nice, cute, and funny as 
                they may sound online. <br>
                Never make plans to meet an online "friend" in person.</li>
              <li>WHEN IN DOUBT -- always ask your parents for help -- and just 
                LOG OFF if you're not sure! You can always go back online later.</li>
