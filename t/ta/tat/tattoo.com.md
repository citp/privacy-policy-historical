 **The Information We Collect**

Any information that you provide through the Tattoo.com registration process or responses to offers made available to you is completely voluntary. You always have a choice whether or not to disclose information requested in the survey, registration or offer. The information we collect includes contact and postal information (such as name, mailing address and telephone number), e-mail address and demographics information (such as age, interests and additional information). Your participation in these questions is completely voluntary.

We cannot accept information from those under the age of 18 years. Those under 18 cannot participate in contest and promotions offered by Tattoo.com or the promotion sponsor. In addition, we do not knowingly collect, use or disseminate any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18. If, however, we become aware that personally identifiable information regarding a child under the age of 18 has been collected, we will delete it from our records. We encourage parents and guardians to participate in and supervise the online activities of their children.

In addition, Tattoo.com provides services for direct marketing applications including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation.
