<p><strong>b. Information collected by Cookies</strong></p>
<p class="articletext">We also make use of website "cookies" to help you use our services more easily and to help us continuously improve our Site and our service to you. A "cookie" is a small data file that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer to help our Site "remember" information about you to make it easier and more efficient to use our Site. Our Site employs session cookies. A session cookie does not remain on your computer after you close your web browser window. Our session cookies contain none of your personal information and cannot be used to track you around the internet. Our session cookies can only be used by this Site and they only exist for the duration of your visit. Depending on the settings in your browser, you may have the option to deny the session cookie; however, doing so may negatively impact upon the performance of the Site or restrict us in better serving your needs and interests. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.</p>

<p><strong>II.	HOW IS MY INFORMATION USED?</strong></p>

<p><strong>a. User Identification</strong></p>
<p class="articletext">For our sites that offer user registration, we may retain this information on a secure server so that on re-visiting our Site, you will not need to re-enter that information. We may use this information in an aggregated form to measure number of visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, and other relevant statistics. We collect this information to measure the use of our Site and to improve the content of our Site.</p>

<p><strong>b. Contacting You Concerning Promotions and New Products</strong></p>
<p class="articletext">We may request you to "opt-in" to receive certain communications from the Site. We will not send unsolicited messages to you concerning promotions or new products or other marketing material unless you have opted-in. If, after you have opted-in, you no longer wish to receive such communications from us please follow the procedures set forth below in the section titled How Can I â€œOpt-outâ€ of Receiving E-mail Communications. Please note that your request to stop receiving these communications may not prevent us from sending such messages that were generated prior to the time we were able to process your request.</p>

<p><strong>c. Use of Your Information</strong></p>
<p class="articletext">At times, we may request you to provide personally identifiable information to identify you as a user of the Site and to assist and speed the completion of transactions on the Site. We may also use information collected about your preferences and activities at the Site, such as the particular pages you request at the Site and purchases or other transactions you effect through the Site. We may vary the content you receive in future visits to the Site based on your preferences and activities.</p>

<p><strong>d. Disclosure of Your Information</strong></p>

<p class="articletext">We will use your information only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to any persons or entities outside of our company, nor lease, license, sublicense, rent, transfer, disclose, disseminate or otherwise grant access to such information unless:

<br>
(i) You have been given an opportunity to "opt-in" and have agreed to opt-in to such disclosure of your information;
<br>
(ii) We must share your information in order to provide a product or service that you have ordered or requested, in which case we will require that any third person or entity we use to fulfill your order agrees that it does not have the right to use your information other than to fulfill your order or request; or
<br>
(iii) We are required to respond to subpoena, court orders or other requirement of law which requires disclosure of your information.
<br>
</p>

<p><strong>e. Disclosure of Aggregate Information</strong></p>

<p class="articletext">We may combine your personally identifying information and information about your preferences and activities, with those of all or a particular group of our users to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities for our internal use. For example, we may track the number of our users who view certain pages or use certain features or compile the total dollar amount of sales conducted through the Site in a particular geographic region or to track purchasing trends. Such information, and other information we derive from individual users' information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality information through more accurate marketing and advertising of the Site. We may share aggregated information concerning our users, without attribution of personal information, to other companies with whom we conduct business. </p>

<p><strong>f. How Can I "Opt-out" of Receiving E-mail Communications?</strong></p>

<p><strong>III.	WHAT WE DO TO KEEP THIS SITE SECURE</strong></p>

<p><strong>a. Security</strong></p>

<p class="articletext">We employ procedural and technical safeguards to secure your personal information against loss, theft, alteration, and unauthorized access, use and disclosure.

You can safely enter your credit card and personal registration information and it cannot be read in transit to our server. We also employ many security procedures to protect your information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company.</p>

<p class="articletext">Regardless of the precautions taken by us we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.</p> 

<p class="articletext">What You Can Do To Protect Your Information?

<br>
(iv) Do not disclose your passwords to the Site or your account information to any other person.

BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
