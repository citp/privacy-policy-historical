                      <p>To accomplish this, we  have implemented a comprehensive Online Privacy Policy that governs all  information collected on or submitted to our Site. To make this Online  Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and  at every point where Personal Information may be requested. By  accessing, browsing or using the Site, you acknowledge that you have  read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions of Tata Communications's Online Privacy Policy, in addition to the Terms of Use  and Acceptable Use Policy, included as part of this Privacy Policy by  reference. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do  not access, browse, or use this Site. </p>
                      <p>Tata Communications has self-certified its adherence to the Safe Harbor principles on the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">Safe Harbor Web site</a>. </p>
                      <p><strong>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</strong>: <br>
                        1. <strong>Non-Personal and Aggregated Information Collected Automatically</strong>.  When you visit our Site, we log general data, such as your domain name  (e.g., aol.com, tata.com), the name of the Web page from which you  entered our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, and how much time  you spend on each page. We use this information to continually monitor  and improve our Site and for internal analysis. In particular, we use  IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's  movement, and gather information for aggregate use. (IP addresses are  not linked to personally identifiable information.) </p>
                      <p>2. <strong>Personal Information That You Choose to Submit</strong>.  As a visitor to our Site, you may choose to use the Site to send us  information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number,  E-mail address or any other information which means we can identify you  as an individual person ("Personal Information"). For example, this may  be when you send a question via the Site, register for a special  service, submit your resume, enter a contest or purchase a product or  service through our Site. Any time you submit Personal Information for  a specific purpose using the Site, your information is used for that  purpose only, unless you consent otherwise or as required by law. When  you submit Personal Information to Tata Communications on this Site, you  understand and agree that this information may be transferred across  national boundaries and may be stored and processed in another country,  which may not provide privacy protections similar to those your country  provides.</p>
                      <p>We do not send unsolicited E-mail to you or other  visitors to our Site. We use E-mail to respond to E-mail messages from  you, to confirm product or service orders placed online and to engage  in other communication that you have authorized or that we have  determined necessary to more effectively service you and our customers.</p>
                      <p>In  many cases, you choose the amount of information you supply (e.g., when  sending us information through the Site, you may choose to include only  an e-mail address - not a telephone number or mailing address - for  replies). There may be instances where some of the information that we  ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. In  such cases, if you do not provide mandatory Personal Information with  respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in  that activity. </p>
                      <p>The information we obtain from you is  generally necessary for us to provide your services and design new  services for your future use. For example, we need to know your name,  address and the services you buy from us to properly provide and bill  for those services. When you call us, our representatives pull up  account records and may refer to your bill, your calling patterns, and  other information we have to answer questions you may have or recommend  how we can best serve you.</p>
                      <p>We may also use information in our  records to protect our customers, employees or property — for instance,  to investigate fraud, harassment or other types of unlawful service  activities involving Tata Communications or other carriers that we do  business with. In some cases, it may be necessary to provide this  information to the government or third parties who make a lawful demand  for it.</p>
                      <p>We share information within our Tata Communications  companies to enable us to better understand our customers' product and  service needs, and to learn how to best design, develop, and package  products and services to meet those needs. Like any large business, we  may structure our company to include a number of smaller companies.  Currently, our primary lines of business include long distance  services, wireless services, dedicated web hosting, Internet access for  businesses on-line services, and international private line services.  We also offer other products and services, for example, Frame Relay,  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), telephone equipment, voice mail  services, and Ethernet services. </p>
                      <p><strong>WHAT ABOUT "COOKIES?"</strong><br>
                        The term "cookie" refers to files that are transferred from a Web site  to your computer's hard drive. The purpose of cookies is to enable us  to track your activities on our Site. Cookies help us remember who you  are. They work in the same fashion as the clerk in a store you visit on  a regular basis. The store clerk may not necessarily know your name,  but he or she recognizes that you have been in the store before and may  remember what you usually purchase while you are in the store. Cookies  permit us to gain the same kind of information about you and enable us  to provide you with more efficient and personalized service. For  example, for sites that require registration, a cookie file can be  stored on your computer enabling you to skip the registration process  on subsequent visits. Cookies are also frequently used to track the  progression of a customer engaged in an online purchase to ensure that  the transactional information remains intact. </p>
                      <p>Some  (usually newer) versions of Web browsers allow you to decide whether or  not to accept cookie files and some programs notify you when a Web site  is about to deposit a cookie file on your hard drive. If you decide not  to accept cookies, you may not be able to successfully navigate some  portions of a Web site.</p>
                      <p>You can check your hard drive for  cookie files. For PC's, look for "cookies.txt" files on your hard  drive. On a Macintosh, look for "magic cookies." There are software  programs available ("cookie cutters" and "anonymizers") that allow you  to selectively edit cookie files. </p>
                      <p>Tata Communications uses  cookie files for online purchasing and the customized presentation of  Web pages. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your  computer that was not originally sent in the cookie, nor do we use  information transferred through cookies for any promotional or  marketing purposes, except as expressly set forth in this Online  Privacy Policy. </p>
                      <p><strong>WHO WE SHARE IT WITH</strong>: <br>
                        We may  share non-personal, aggregated information with our customers,  partners, and advertisers. Aggregated information is not linked to any  Personal Information.</p>
                      <p>Unless  we have your permission or are required by law, we only share the  Personal Information you provide through our Site with Tata Communications affiliates and/or business partners that are acting on  our behalf. Tata Communications reserves the right to disclose customer  information to the extent authorized by federal surveillance statutes.  We make every reasonable effort to ensure that such Tata Communications  affiliates and business partners, including those in the U.S. and/or  any other countries, protect your Personal Information consistent with  our Online Privacy Policy.</p>
                      <p>Tata Communications works with  third parties to research certain usage and activities on our Web site  on our behalf. Some third parties utilize Web beacons to conduct this  research. Information collected through Web beacons helps us to  identify user demographics and usage patterns to improve our  measurements, reporting, and the effectiveness of our marketing  efforts. Information recorded through Web beacons is aggregated and  then shared with Tata Communications. No personally identifiable  information about you is shared by these third parties with Tata Communications as a result of this research. If you prefer not to  participate in the Web beacon research on the Tata Communications Web  site, please visit each of the third party's Web site individually in  order to opt out. </p>
                      <p><strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</strong>:<br>
                        To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the  correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical,  electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the  information we collect through the Site. However, please be advised  that Tata Communications cannot guarantee and has no control over the  public or third party network through which you send your Personal  Information to Tata Communications's Site. Tata Communications requires  employees to keep customer information confidential and we hold them  accountable for their actions.</p>
                      <p><strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong>:<br>
                        Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that  reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those  we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to  attract anyone under 13. Tata Communications Web sites are intended for  a general audience and do not knowingly collect any personally  identifiable information from children. </p>
                      <p><strong>LINKED INTERNET WEB SITES</strong>:<br>
                        This Site provides hyperlinks, which are highlighted words or pictures  within a hypertext document that, when clicked, take you to another  place within the document, to another document altogether, or to other  Web sites not controlled by Tata Communications. These hyper-linked Web  sites may contain privacy provisions that are different from those  provided herein. Tata Communications is not responsible for the  collection, use or disclosure of information collected through these  Web sites, and Tata Communications expressly disclaims any and all  liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.</p>
                      <p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNT INFORMATION</strong><br>
                        If you tell us in writing to release your account information to  someone, we will honor your request and provide that information.</p>
                      <p>Your  account information is released to other carriers when you give us your  permission or when they advise us they have your approval to access the  information. This most often occurs with respect to a sale of service  they want to make or have made to you. Unless we are advised that  permission from you has been granted, we do not release the information.</p>
                      <p>We  may provide account information to collection agencies when customers  do not pay their bills. We restrict the use that can be made of this  information to collection activities only for our charges and for the  charges we bill for others.</p>
                      <p>Other carriers use Tata Communications to bill for their charges. In this case, they provide us  with information about you, including your calling patterns, and we  bill you on their behalf. In turn, we provide them with non-sensitive  information about your service, such as the date your service was  established or disconnected; whether you have toll or 900 blocking  services, whether you have a calling card or not and when it was  issued, how you pay your bills and if they are paid on time.</p>
                      <p><strong>HOW TO CORRECT, AMEND, OR DELETE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>:<br>
                        We honor requests from you to correct, amend, or delete your account  information (for example, your name, address, or billing information).  You may verify that appropriate corrections have been made. To correct,  amend or delete account information, contact the Webmaster at <a href="mailto:Privacy@tatacommunications.com">Privacy@tatacommunications.com</a>.  To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable  steps to verify your identity before granting access or making  corrections.</p>
                      <p><strong>ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong><br>
                        This  Online Privacy Policy is subject to change. Any changes to Tata Communications's Online Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site. All  information submitted through the Site to Tata Communications is subject  to the terms and conditions of this Online Privacy Policy, as amended. </p>
                      <p><strong>TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES</strong><br>
                        Tata Communications may from time to time transfer Personal Information  between Countries. When Tata Communications transfers Personal  Information between countries of the European Union and the United  States, we will insure that the recipient has adequate procedures in  place to protect such information. The recipient of Personal  Information must either participate in the Safe Harbor program  developed by the United States Department of Commerce and the European  Union or accept contractual clauses assuring the adequate protection of  the Personal Information. Companies which participate in the Safe  Harbor program have certified that they adhere to the Safe Harbor  Privacy Principles agreed upon by the United States and the European  Union. For more information about the Safe Harbor program, please visit  the United States Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor web site at URL: <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a> </p>
