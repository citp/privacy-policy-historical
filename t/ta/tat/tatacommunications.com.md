# Tata Communications - Privacy Policy

To accomplish this, we have implemented a comprehensive Online Privacy Policy that governs all information collected on or submitted to our Site. To make this Online Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where Personal Information may be requested. By accessing, browsing or using the Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions of Tata Communications's Online Privacy Policy, in addition to the Terms of Use and Acceptable Use Policy, included as part of this Privacy Policy by reference. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not access, browse, or use this Site. 

Tata Communications has self-certified its adherence to the Safe Harbor principles on the [Safe Harbor Web site](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor). 

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT** :   
1\. **Non-Personal and Aggregated Information Collected Automatically**. When you visit our Site, we log general data, such as your domain name (e.g., aol.com, tata.com), the name of the Web page from which you entered our Site, which pages you visit on our Site, and how much time you spend on each page. We use this information to continually monitor and improve our Site and for internal analysis. In particular, we use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement, and gather information for aggregate use. (IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.) 

2\. **Personal Information That You Choose to Submit**. As a visitor to our Site, you may choose to use the Site to send us information such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, E-mail address or any other information which means we can identify you as an individual person ("Personal Information"). For example, this may be when you send a question via the Site, register for a special service, submit your resume, enter a contest or purchase a product or service through our Site. Any time you submit Personal Information for a specific purpose using the Site, your information is used for that purpose only, unless you consent otherwise or as required by law. When you submit Personal Information to Tata Communications on this Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in another country, which may not provide privacy protections similar to those your country provides.

We do not send unsolicited E-mail to you or other visitors to our Site. We use E-mail to respond to E-mail messages from you, to confirm product or service orders placed online and to engage in other communication that you have authorized or that we have determined necessary to more effectively service you and our customers.

In many cases, you choose the amount of information you supply (e.g., when sending us information through the Site, you may choose to include only an e-mail address - not a telephone number or mailing address - for replies). There may be instances where some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. In such cases, if you do not provide mandatory Personal Information with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. 

The information we obtain from you is generally necessary for us to provide your services and design new services for your future use. For example, we need to know your name, address and the services you buy from us to properly provide and bill for those services. When you call us, our representatives pull up account records and may refer to your bill, your calling patterns, and other information we have to answer questions you may have or recommend how we can best serve you.

We may also use information in our records to protect our customers, employees or property — for instance, to investigate fraud, harassment or other types of unlawful service activities involving Tata Communications or other carriers that we do business with. In some cases, it may be necessary to provide this information to the government or third parties who make a lawful demand for it.

We share information within our Tata Communications companies to enable us to better understand our customers' product and service needs, and to learn how to best design, develop, and package products and services to meet those needs. Like any large business, we may structure our company to include a number of smaller companies. Currently, our primary lines of business include long distance services, wireless services, dedicated web hosting, Internet access for businesses on-line services, and international private line services. We also offer other products and services, for example, Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), telephone equipment, voice mail services, and Ethernet services. 

**WHAT ABOUT "COOKIES?"**  
The term "cookie" refers to files that are transferred from a Web site to your computer's hard drive. The purpose of cookies is to enable us to track your activities on our Site. Cookies help us remember who you are. They work in the same fashion as the clerk in a store you visit on a regular basis. The store clerk may not necessarily know your name, but he or she recognizes that you have been in the store before and may remember what you usually purchase while you are in the store. Cookies permit us to gain the same kind of information about you and enable us to provide you with more efficient and personalized service. For example, for sites that require registration, a cookie file can be stored on your computer enabling you to skip the registration process on subsequent visits. Cookies are also frequently used to track the progression of a customer engaged in an online purchase to ensure that the transactional information remains intact. 

Some (usually newer) versions of Web browsers allow you to decide whether or not to accept cookie files and some programs notify you when a Web site is about to deposit a cookie file on your hard drive. If you decide not to accept cookies, you may not be able to successfully navigate some portions of a Web site.

You can check your hard drive for cookie files. For PC's, look for "cookies.txt" files on your hard drive. On a Macintosh, look for "magic cookies." There are software programs available ("cookie cutters" and "anonymizers") that allow you to selectively edit cookie files. 

Tata Communications uses cookie files for online purchasing and the customized presentation of Web pages. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in the cookie, nor do we use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, except as expressly set forth in this Online Privacy Policy. 

**WHO WE SHARE IT WITH** :   
We may share non-personal, aggregated information with our customers, partners, and advertisers. Aggregated information is not linked to any Personal Information.

Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we only share the Personal Information you provide through our Site with Tata Communications affiliates and/or business partners that are acting on our behalf. Tata Communications reserves the right to disclose customer information to the extent authorized by federal surveillance statutes. We make every reasonable effort to ensure that such Tata Communications affiliates and business partners, including those in the U.S. and/or any other countries, protect your Personal Information consistent with our Online Privacy Policy.

Tata Communications works with third parties to research certain usage and activities on our Web site on our behalf. Some third parties utilize Web beacons to conduct this research. Information collected through Web beacons helps us to identify user demographics and usage patterns to improve our measurements, reporting, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Information recorded through Web beacons is aggregated and then shared with Tata Communications. No personally identifiable information about you is shared by these third parties with Tata Communications as a result of this research. If you prefer not to participate in the Web beacon research on the Tata Communications Web site, please visit each of the third party's Web site individually in order to opt out. 

**OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY** :  
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect through the Site. However, please be advised that Tata Communications cannot guarantee and has no control over the public or third party network through which you send your Personal Information to Tata Communications's Site. Tata Communications requires employees to keep customer information confidential and we hold them accountable for their actions.

**OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN'S PRIVACY** :  
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13. Tata Communications Web sites are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children. 

**LINKED INTERNET WEB SITES** :  
This Site provides hyperlinks, which are highlighted words or pictures within a hypertext document that, when clicked, take you to another place within the document, to another document altogether, or to other Web sites not controlled by Tata Communications. These hyper-linked Web sites may contain privacy provisions that are different from those provided herein. Tata Communications is not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of information collected through these Web sites, and Tata Communications expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.

**DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNT INFORMATION**  
If you tell us in writing to release your account information to someone, we will honor your request and provide that information.

Your account information is released to other carriers when you give us your permission or when they advise us they have your approval to access the information. This most often occurs with respect to a sale of service they want to make or have made to you. Unless we are advised that permission from you has been granted, we do not release the information.

We may provide account information to collection agencies when customers do not pay their bills. We restrict the use that can be made of this information to collection activities only for our charges and for the charges we bill for others.

Other carriers use Tata Communications to bill for their charges. In this case, they provide us with information about you, including your calling patterns, and we bill you on their behalf. In turn, we provide them with non-sensitive information about your service, such as the date your service was established or disconnected; whether you have toll or 900 blocking services, whether you have a calling card or not and when it was issued, how you pay your bills and if they are paid on time.

**HOW TO CORRECT, AMEND, OR DELETE YOUR INFORMATION** :  
We honor requests from you to correct, amend, or delete your account information (for example, your name, address, or billing information). You may verify that appropriate corrections have been made. To correct, amend or delete account information, contact the Webmaster at [Privacy@tatacommunications.com](mailto:Privacy@tatacommunications.com). To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

**ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**  
This Online Privacy Policy is subject to change. Any changes to Tata Communications's Online Privacy Policy will be posted on the Site. All information submitted through the Site to Tata Communications is subject to the terms and conditions of this Online Privacy Policy, as amended. 

**TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES**  
Tata Communications may from time to time transfer Personal Information between Countries. When Tata Communications transfers Personal Information between countries of the European Union and the United States, we will insure that the recipient has adequate procedures in place to protect such information. The recipient of Personal Information must either participate in the Safe Harbor program developed by the United States Department of Commerce and the European Union or accept contractual clauses assuring the adequate protection of the Personal Information. Companies which participate in the Safe Harbor program have certified that they adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles agreed upon by the United States and the European Union. For more information about the Safe Harbor program, please visit the United States Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor web site at URL: [www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/)
