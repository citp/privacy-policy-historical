**Information about TaxiPark.**  
The TaxiPark revolution began in February 2012. Our mission was simple - To give passengers and drivers alike a more reliable, user-friendly and safe way to move around the city. We all know how unorganized, inconvenient and not easily accessible getting a taxi in Lagos is, that's why we built our service to be as convenient as possible. We are proud to say we have the 1st online taxi booking service in Nigeria and 50+ licensed cabs registered on our platform. We also understand how hard it is for taxi/car hiring companies to manage drivers and track cars. So we developed our TaxiPark Cloud Console, giving taxi companies the power to track and mange driver movements. 

**How it works - Passengers**  
TaxiPark allows you to book a taxi ride, wherever you are, directly from your computer or mobile phone (well, in Lagos for now, of course). No more phone calls. No more flagging down taxis on the highway or looking for the closest taxi park to you.   
Need to book in advance? No problem. Simply schedule a time and a taxi will be right there. It's that easy   
**How it works - Taxi/Car Hiring Companies**  
TaxiPark will bring you more high value account and cash jobs. Manage and track all bookings in real time using the TaxiPark Cloud Console via a PC.
