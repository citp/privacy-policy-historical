				<h4>Third Party Intermediaries</h4>
				<p>We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
				<p>We use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and cookies are used in those email messages and at our website to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. For more information about the technology used to deliver our emails, or how to set your browser to reject cookies, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/">click here</a>.</p>
				<p>We may use advertising companies to serve advertisements for or on our website. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>) and here (<a href="http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html">http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html</a>).  We do not share, rent or sell any personally identifiable information (including email address) to these companies.</p>
				<p>On occasion, we will enter into a written contract with third party intermediary companies to help us to complete a business process, service, or function on our behalf.

				<p>Written agreements are established between 2nd Story Software and all third party intermediaries, as well as joint marketing and alliance companies. Each agreement strictly limits the use of your personally identifiable information to the scope of the contract. Contractual agreements, such as these, also stipulate safeguard, handling, and other precautionary care procedures, which are required to be taken.

At 2nd Story Software we use the industry-standard Secure Socket Layers (SSL) protocol which provides data encryption, message integrity, and server authentication when your data is sent to us. When you see a small lock in the bottom right or left corner of your browser window, you know your data is being encrypted for transmission.</p>
				<p>All information you enter while using TaxACT is used strictly by 2nd Story Software, Inc. to provide the services requested by our customers.

Electronically filed returns, which are further encrypted, are sent directly from 2nd Story Software to the IRS via a secure connection.

				<h4>Service Alerts and Critical Notices</h4>
				<p>Although we respect and honor your privacy preferences, 2nd Story Software shall maintain the right to contact you when it is required to make you aware of changes (that are of a non-marketing nature), which may impact your ability to use TaxACT products and services, or to provide you with a bug alert.</p>

No information (including email address) supplied by an affiliate is shared or sold to a third party.</p>
				<h4>Use of Log Files, LiveStats and Cookies</h4>
				<p>Like most Web servers, 2nd Story Software relies on log files. Log files include:  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), number of page views, platform type, date and time stamps, as well as the number visitors to our web site. This information is used by 2nd Story Software to administer the site, analyze trends, track aggregated user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregated use only. Our Web site also uses tracking software, which is supplied by LiveStats by DeepMetrix. This software further enables us to anonymously analyze trends occurring  on our Web site. Personally identifiable information (including email address) is not stored by the LiveStats server, as the software does not collect personal information such as name, age, phone number, mailing address, email address or credit card numbers from visitors. For more information about the LiveStats Log Analyzer Software and DeepMetrix's commitment to privacy for the companies who use LiveStats, visit <a href="http://www.deepmetrix.com/legal/privacy/products/">http://www.deepmetrix.com/legal/privacy/products/</a>. For each visitor to our Web page, LiveStats automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, IP address, access times, and pages viewed. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information (including email address).</p>
				<p>TaxACT.com employs the use of cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information (including email address) while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. If users reject the cookie, they will not be able to purchase products from the TaxACT.com website.</p>
				<h4>General Disclosure of Aggregated Information</h4>
				<p>2nd Story Software may disclose aggregate information to the IRS or other parties, however, may not represent any information, which may be used to identify you personally or individually (including email address) without your expressed consent. Examples may include, but are not limited to:  the total number of users served by a TaxACT product/service, general age group ratios, and other statistical data relating to tax preparation and electronic filing service.</p>
				<h4>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h4>
				<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
				<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information (including email address) in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days.</p>
				<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
				<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>
