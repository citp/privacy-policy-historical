Privacy Policy   
May, 2003 

Universal Tax Systems, Inc. (UTS) makes protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of the personal information you enter into TaxWise.com a top priority. TaxWise.com has the following position regarding your rights to privacy and confidentiality. Please read this statement carefully and refer to it whenever necessary. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, please contact the Marketing department at: UTS Marketing, 6 Mathis Drive, NW, Rome, Georgia, 30165 or by e-mail at [marketing@taxwise.com](mailto:customer.support@taxwise.com) or at 706/624-4200. 

TaxWise.com wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for TaxWise.com, including: 

  1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personal identification is collected from you through our web site 
  2. How the information is used 
  3. With whom the information may be shared 
  4. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information   

  5. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under UTS' control 
  6. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information 



**Information Collection and Use**   
Universal Tax Systems, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected from the TaxWise.com site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different than what is disclosed in this statement. UTS collects information from our users at several different points on our website. 

**Registration**   
In order to access advanced support options, a user must first complete the user login form. During this login process a user is required to give his/her Client ID, EFIN, and registration code. This information is used to identify the user before he/she accesses the advanced support options. It is required for the user to provide this information when accessing advanced support options so we can provide a more personalized support experience. 

**Ordering**   
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill the customer's order(s). If we have difficulty processing an order, the contact information is used to get in touch with the user. Use of all TaxWise products is subject to the terms and conditions of the current UTS software license agreement. [Please see additional information here](https://web.archive.org/_inc/content-managed/pdf/taxwiseLA.pdf). 

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to login a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. Cookies can also enable us to track the interests of our users to enhance the experience of our site. 

**Log Files**   
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**   
We process credit card transactions directly with Visa Net for all billed goods and services. Visa Net does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

We partner with other third party companies to provide specific services such as bank products. When the user signs up for these services, we will share their names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. 

These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

Personally identifiable information is not otherwise released by UTS to outside parties except as set forth in this Privacy Statement unless required by law or legal process (for example, subpoena). UTS reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in exceptional circumstances (such as suspected illegal activity) on a case by case basis and at the sole discretion of UTS. UTS abides by applicable laws and regulations governing the disclosure of information to governmental agencies. When responding to legal process served on UTS by non-governmental agencies, unless otherwise ordered, the policy of UTS is to make reasonable efforts to notify affected customers in advance of releasing requested information and to provide customers the opportunity to pursue available legal action. 

**Links**   
TaxWise.com contains links to other web sites. Please be aware that we, UTS, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by TaxWise.com. 

**Newsletter**   
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. 

**Choice/Opt-out**   
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the un-subscribe option in the newsletter email or by contacting Customer Support at [marketing@taxwise.com](mailto:customer.support@taxwise.com)

**Surveys & Contests**   
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as your name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, business size, etc.). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey (demographic) information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our site, products and/or services. 

**Security**   
Universal Tax Systems takes strong precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our return query form asks users to enter sensitive information such as a social security number, that information is protected with encryption software that sets the Internet standard for secure transactions - SSL. While on a secure page the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL and TaxWise.com security measures, see our [Security Statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20040607052122id_/http%3A//taxwise.com/security.asp). 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take strong precautions to protect a user's information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who require the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer support representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must record the instance in your records each time your information is accessed. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. On an ongoing basis, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, in a limited access room inside a locked case. 

**Site & Service Updates**   
From time to time we may send the user site and customer service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from customer service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via e-mail or phone. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that his/her contact information is current and correct, including for purposes of Notification of Changes to the privacy policy as set forth below. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**   
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as e-mail address), or if a user no longer wishes to use our services, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done at the My Information section under the user login section of the site or by contacting Customer Support by e-mail, phone, or fax. 

**Notification of Changes**   
If we decide to materially change our privacy policy, we will post a link to those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we would notify users by e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. UTS encourages you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to be informed of how we are protecting your information. 

**Customer Responsibilities**   
While UTS provides significant security measures to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the user's information, the TaxWise customer is responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the individual EFIN and registration code assigned to his/her office. The TaxWise customer is also responsible for protecting the confidentiality of all tax return information originating from his/her account, and more particularly such information that is accessed through the use of such EFIN and registration code.
