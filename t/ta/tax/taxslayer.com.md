**Links**

As a service to our customers, we have installed links to various tax agencies/services.   These include IRS.Gov, and various state agencies and organizations. The links provided are maintained by these separate entities and are not the property of, or affiliated with, Taxslayer.com. 

**Our Former Customers**

Even if you are no longer a TaxSlayer customer, our Privacy Policy will continue to apply to you. 

**Our Security Practices and Information Accuracy**

We take every step available to safeguard customer information. All forms accepting user information are processed on our secure servers. 

TaxSlayer's electronic filing process is different than most in the fact that you download our software and install it on your personal PC or you may file your return on a Web based page. Once you have completed the return on your personal PC, you are asked to transmit the return to TaxSlayer's secure website. In both the download and the web versions, the tax return file is encrypted to avoid any unwanted detection. Immediately after the files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's website, they are moved to a different location providing less likelihood of unwanted intervention. They are again moved a third time to begin processing. All acknowledgements are handled by e-mail with only general information given. Acknowledgements can also be retrieved via our website again without general information provided. (Example: IRS accepted or rejected, acceptance date, etc.) TaxSlayer will not issue a refund for returns rejected by the IRS or any state agency. Confidential information such as refund amounts, names, addresses, and account numbers are not displayed or e-mailed. 

Incomplete tax returns or returns that are not accepted by the IRS will be deleted. 

TaxSlayer.com takes industry standard measures to protect the personal information we collect. We provide high level types of security measures including, but not limited to, firewalls and protected facilities. Our Web site uses SSL encryption to transmit sensitive information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable law and federal standards. 

We strive to keep our customer information as accurate and complete as we can. If you believe any of the information about you is not accurate, please let us know.

Personal Information is accessible online through Oct. 20th, 2010. You may view and/or make changes to your personal information by visiting your account online at www.taxslayer.com and selecting "Edit Account Information ". Any return e-filed through TaxSlayer.com will be available only in PDF format (fees may apply).
