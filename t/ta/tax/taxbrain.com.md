Information Collection and Use  
---  
  
**Information Collection**

Petz Enterprises, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on Taxbrain.com. Taxbrain collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

**Registration**

In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information such as name, address, phone number and email address. We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which they have expressed interest.

**Order Information**

We request information from users on our order form. A user must provide contact information such as name, email, address and phone number and financial information such as credit card number, expiration date and bank account information. All financial information collected on our site will remain absolutely confidential and will never be disclosed to any non-affiliated companies except as required by law. Financial information includes information such as credit card numbers and bank account information. We may store such information on our secure servers to expedite processing of certain services and products we provide to you. We may use your contact information to notify you of important product updates, significant tax law changes or promotional opportunities - if you have chosen to receive such offers. 

**Tax Related Information**

When a tax return is prepared on Taxbrain the information contained in the tax return will be treated with extreme care and confidence. To prepare a tax return on our site you will have to enter the personal information, which is required to file. In addition to your own personally identifying information you will have to enter the information for anyone else listed on the return, such as your spouse or dependents. As a method for detecting fraud in tax information transmitted via the Internet, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires Petz Enterprises to provide to the IRS, in connection with the electronic filing of tax returns, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated. We are also required to notify the IRS whether the e-mail address of the person electronically filing the return has been collected. 

**Identifying and Contact Information**

From time to time, users may be asked to provide certain Identifying and Contact Information, such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, user name, and demographic information. This information is used to verify identity, determine eligibility for special programs or services we may offer and complete transactions. At times it will be necessary to use Contact Information to communicate with users concerning administrative matters, responding to user requests and notifying users of the status of their transactions. However, we will not disclose Identifying and Contact Information to third parties without prior consent, except as required by law.  


**  
Cookies **

A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web sites may provide to a user's browser while they are at our site. Registered users on Taxbrain will receive a cookie when they login. This cookie is maintained by their browser and contains their unique identifier. This cookie is also used to authenticate their identity and provide access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered users, such as those for tax return preparation and electronic filing. The cookie is tied to the user's account id. Only Taxbrain knows what personal information matches the account id number. There is no way any personally identifiable information could be directly extracted from our cookie. However, if a user has opted to have their username and password remembered, the information is stored in the cookie. 

**Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. We also record your IP address as is required by the IRS. This IP address would only be released if ordered by a US court of law.

**Legal Disclaimer**  
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe such disclose is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.

Third Party Intermediaries  
  
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Financial Service Providers**

We partner with other third party banks, such as MetaBank ("META"), to provide specific financial services. When users sign up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact information (such as name, address, social security number and phone number) that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.  


**  
Live Chat **

To better serve our users we contract with LivePerson to offer live chat. LivePerson's privacy policy can be reviewed at <http://www.liveperson.com/help/privacy.asp>. To use the chat service you will be required to enter your email address. Upon exiting the chat session you will be given an option of having a transcript of your chat emailed to you. LivePerson may store a log of your chat session for up to 13 months, however they will not share your information with anyone unless it is required by law.   


**  
Business Transitions **

In the event Taxbrain goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email and prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section. 

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Petz Enterprises Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

Communications from the Site  
  
**Special Offers and Updates**

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify registration. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a self-service opt-out of these communications at <http://www.taxbrain.com/optout.asp>.   


**  
Service Announcements **

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.  


**  
Customer Service **

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the your wishes.

Our site does link to other sites in order to provide all of the tax and financial services users might need. PEI has partnered with these sites for content use and may share user information disclosed on our site with them on an aggregate basis for advertisement tracking only. We will not disclose personally identifying information without prior consent. Taxbrain provides services in conjunction with third party companies. With your permission, you will have the ability upload information to your Taxbrain account, from accounts you hold with third party partners. This upload of information to Taxbrain.com is done to fulfill the full service of our site and no other purpose. For example, we can upload W-2s from employers and other content for forms from our partner organizations. These are the instances in which we will share users' personal information.

Security Information  
  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.   
Taxbrain account information is password-protected so that only the registered owner of an account will have access to their personal information. Account information may be updated by entering a user name and password to gain access to the account. We strongly recommend that users do not share their user name and password with anyone. PEI will never ask a user for their user name or password via unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Security is of utmost importance to Petz Enterprises and we use the latest SSL technology to protect confidential information.   
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected computers. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked door in a locked facility. If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to [support@taxbrain.com](mailto:support@taxbrain.com) . 

**  
Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information **

We provide the opportunity to update or correct the contact and tax return information provided to us. Users can update their information at any time by logging into myTaxbrain and accessing their return file or account information page. The tax return information and personally identifiable information collected through this site is contained in tax returns and in product registration information. Once a tax return has been completed using the Taxbrain Web product, and directed that it be electronically filed, it cannot be changed because the tax return has become a legal record of the tax filing. Any changes made to a tax return after it has already been electronically filed, and acknowledged by the IRS, will generate a Form 1040X (amended return).  


**  
Notification of Changes **

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

  
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.
