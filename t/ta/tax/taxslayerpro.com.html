                      We have

                      Visiting our Web Site <br>
  We will not collect personal information about you just because you visit this
    site. In order to improve the usefulness of our web site for our visitors,
    we automatically collect and maintain statistical information from our site's
    data logs that concern network traffic flow and volume. This information
    consists of:<br>
    The name of the domain from which the visitor accesses the Internet (e.g., "a
  company.com"; "a school.edu"; or "an agency.gov");<br>
  The Internet Protocol Number; and<br>
  The date and time the IRS web site is visited.<br>
  <br>
  This information does not identify
  individual visitors and is used to enhance and improve your experience on our
                      site. No attempts are made to identify individual users
                      unless illegal behavior is suspected.<br>

                      Purchasing our Products <br>
                      The purpose of this site is to market and sell our software.
                      As a result, you may have to provide us your personal information
                      and/or email address. We do not share or disseminate this
                      information to other vendors or clients.&nbsp; This
    information is kept in strictest, secure, confidence. If you choose to purchase
    our products online, you will be asked for personal information as well as
    your credit card number.&nbsp; The forms requesting this information are
    on a secure server.&nbsp; All steps are taken to safeguard your information.<br>
    <br>
    Sharing
    Information Within TaxSlayer Corporate Family <br>
  We may share information about you and the products and services you have purchased
  from us, among members of the TaxSlayer Corporate family, all of whom follow
  our Privacy Policy. However, this information will not be provided to third
  parties outside or corporate family, except as noted below:<br>
  <br>
  With Service Providers <br>
  In some cases, we employ service providers to provide a product you order,
    to fulfill a service you request, or to market one of our products or services.
    Examples include delivering downloadable products, offering online software
    applications, or sending e-mails on our behalf. While this may require us
    to share information, these service providers are strictly prohibited from
    using your information other than to act on our behalf.<br>
    <br>
    For Legal Reasons <br>
  We may be required to provide information about you to third parties outside
    of the TaxSlayer corporate family without your consent as provided by law,
    such as, to respond to a subpoena or court order, judicial process or regulatory
    authorities, to protect against fraud.<br>
    <br>
    In Case of Sale of Company <br>
  Your information may be transferred in connection with a proposed or actual
    sale, merger, or transfer of all or a portion of a business or operating
    unit.<br>
    <br>
    Our Former Customers <br>
  Even if you are no longer a TaxSlayer customer, our Privacy Policy will continue
    to apply to you.<br>
    <br>
    Our Security Practices and Information Accuracy <br>
  We take every step available to safeguard customer information. All forms accepting
    user information are processed on our secure servers.<br>
    <br>
    TaxSlayer's electronic
  filing process is different than most in the fact that you download our software
  and install it on your personal PC. Once you have completed the return
                      on your personal PC, you are asked to transmit the return
                      to TaxSlayer's secure website. The tax return file is encrypted
                      to avoid any unwanted detection. Immediately after the
                      files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's website, they are
                      moved to a different location providing less likelihood
                      of unwanted intervention. They are again moved a third
                      time to begin processing. All acknowledgements are handled
                      by e-mail with only general information given. Acknowledgements
                      can also be retrieved via our website again without general
                      information provided. (Example: IRS accepted or rejected,
                      acceptance date, etc.) Confidential information such as
                      refund amounts, names, addresses, and account numbers are
                      not displayed or e-mailed.<br>
                      <br>
                      We strive to keep our customer
    information as accurate and complete as we can. If you believe any of the
    information about you is not accurate, please let us know.<br>
    <br>
