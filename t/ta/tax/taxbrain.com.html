To prepare a tax return on our site you will have to enter the personal information, which is required to file. In addition to your own personally identifying information you will have to enter the information for anyone else listed on the return, such as your spouse or dependents.  As a method for detecting fraud in tax information transmitted via the Internet, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires Liberty Tax Service to provide to the IRS, in connection with the electronic filing of tax returns, the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated. We are also required to notify the IRS whether the e-mail address of the person electronically filing the return has been collected. <br>

The cookie is tied to the user's account id. Only Taxbrain knows what personal information matches the account id number.

We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. We also record your IP address as is required by the IRS.

Liberty Tax Service has partnered with these sites for content use and may share user information disclosed on our site with them on an aggregate basis for advertisement tracking only. We will not disclose personally identifying information without prior consent. Taxbrain provides services in conjunction with third party companies. With your permission, you will have the ability upload information to your Taxbrain account, from accounts you hold with third party partners. This upload of information to Taxbrain.com is done to fulfill the full service of our site and no other purpose.

                          Taxbrain account information is password-protected so that only the registered owner of an account will have access to their personal information. Account information may be updated by entering a user name and password to gain access to the account. We strongly recommend that users do not share their user name and password with anyone. Liberty Tax Service will never ask a user for their user name or password via unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Security is of utmost importance to Liberty Tax Service and we use the latest SSL technology to protect confidential information. <br>
                          While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected computers. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked door in a locked facility. If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to <a href="&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;mailto:support@taxbrain.com">support@taxbrain.com</a> . </p>

Users can update their information at any time by logging into myTaxbrain and accessing their return file or account information page. The tax return information and personally identifiable information collected through this site is contained in tax returns and in product registration information. Once a tax return has been completed using the Taxbrain Web product, and directed that it be electronically filed, it cannot be changed because the tax return has become a legal record of the tax filing. Any changes made to a tax return after it has already been electronically filed, and acknowledged by the IRS, will generate a Form 1040X (amended return).<br>

                            If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. </p>
