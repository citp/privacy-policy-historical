      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Information Collection</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">Petz Enterprises, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected 
        on TaxBrain.com. TaxBrain collects information from our users at several 
        different points on our Web site.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Registration</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">In order to use this Web site, a user must first complete the registration 
        form. During registration a user is required to give contact information 
        such as name, address, phone number and email address. We use this information 
        to contact the user about services on our site for which they have expressed 
        interest. </p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Order Information</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">We request information from users on our order form. A user must provide 
        contact information such as name, email, address and phone number and 
        financial information such as credit card number, expiration date and 
        bank account information. All financial information collected on our site 
        will remain absolutely confidential and will never be disclosed to any 
        non-affiliated companies except as required by law. Financial information 
        includes information such as credit card numbers and bank account information. 
        We may store such information on our secure servers to expedite processing 
        of certain services and products we provide to you. We may use your contact 
        information to notify you of important product updates, significant tax 
        law changes or promotional opportunities – if you have chosen to 
        receive such offers.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Tax Related Information</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">When a tax return is prepared on TaxBrain the information contained in 
        the tax return will be treated with extreme care and confidence. As a 
        method for detecting fraud in tax information transmitted via the Internet, 
        the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires Petz Enterprises to provide 
        to the IRS, in connection with the electronic filing of tax returns, the 
        Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from which the return originated. 
        We are also required to notify the IRS whether the e-mail address of the 
        person electronically filing the return has been collected. </p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Tax Estimator and W-4 Calculator</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">Information entered into the Tax Estimator and W-4 Calculator is used 
        solely to provide tax estimates and does not collect personally identifiable 
        information. The information that you provide is not saved or transferred 
        to any other party.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Identifying and Contact Information</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">From time to time, users may be asked to provide certain Identifying 
        and Contact Information, such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, 
        telephone number, user name, and demographic information. This information 
        is used to verify identity, determine eligibility for special programs 
        or services we may offer and complete transactions. At times it will be 
        necessary to use Contact Information to communicate with users concerning 
        administrative matters, responding to user requests and notifying users 
        of the status of their transactions. However, we will not disclose Identifying 
        and Contact Information to third parties without prior consent, except 
        as required by law.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Contest/Promotions and Surveys</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">At times we will administer contests and online surveys where we will 
        ask for contact information, such as e-mail address and demographic information, 
        such as zip code, age or income level. The reason the information is being 
        collected will be disclosed with the contest or survey at the time the 
        information is collected.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Public Forums</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups 
        available. Information disclosed in these areas becomes public information. 
        Caution should be exercised when disclosing personal information in these 
        applications.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Profile</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">We store information that we collect through forms and cookies to create 
        a profile of our users. A profile is stored information we keep that supplies 
        us with details of viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information 
        is tied to the users’ personally identifiable information to provide 
        offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile 
        is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct 
        pertinent marketing promotions to them. Profiles could be shared with 
        third parties in aggregate form only.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Cookies</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web sites 
        may provide to a user’s browser while they are at our site. Registered 
        users on TaxBrain will receive a cookie when they login. This cookie is 
        maintained by their browser and contains their unique identifier. This 
        cookie is also used to authenticate their identity and provide access 
        to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered users, such as 
        those for tax return preparation and electronic filing. The cookie is 
        tied to the user’s account id. Only TaxBrain knows what personal 
        information matches the account id number. There is no way any personally 
        identifiable information could be directly extracted from our cookie. 
        However, if a user has opted to have their username and password remembered, 
        the information is stored in the cookie.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Log Files </span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. With or without 
        cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as internet protocol 
        (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit 
        pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze 
        trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, 
        and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, 
        etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use this 
        data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know 
        what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in 
        log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. We store 
        log information that we collect to create a profile of our users.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Communications from the Site</span></p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Special Offers and Updates</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">We send all new members a welcoming email to verify registration. Established 
        members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special 
        deals, and a newsletter.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Newsletter</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information 
        such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we 
        provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice 
        and Opt-out sections.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Service Announcements</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related 
        announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for 
        maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out 
        of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, 
        these communications are not promotional in nature. </p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Customer Service</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services 
        and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email 
        or phone, in accordance with the your wishes.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES"> Information Sharing</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to 
        disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith 
        belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial 
        proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.<br>
        Our site does link to other sites in order to provide all of the tax and 
        financial services users might need. PEI has partnered with these sites 
        for content use and may share user information disclosed on our site with 
        them on an aggregate basis for advertisement tracking only. We will never 
        disclose personally Identifying information without prior consent. TaxBrain 
        provides services in conjunction with third party companies. With your 
        permission, your TaxBrain account will have the ability to log into accounts, 
        and upload information to your TaxBrain account, that you hold with third 
        party partners. This upload of information to TaxBrain.com is done to 
        fulfill the full service of our site and no other purpose. For example, 
        we can upload W-2s from employers and other content for forms from our 
        partner organizations.</p>
        <p class="LTContent">These are the instances in which we will share users’ personal 
          information</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Third Party Intermediaries</span></p>
        <p class="LTContent">We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card 
          processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies 
          do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information 
          for any secondary purposes.</p>
        <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Service Providers</span></p>
        <p class="LTContent">We partner with other third party banks, such as the Santa Barbara 
          Bank &amp; Trust, to provide specific financial services. When users 
          sign up for these particular services, we share names, or other contact 
          information (such as name, address, social security number and phone 
          number) that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. 
          These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information 
          except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
        <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Business Transitions</span></p>
        <p class="LTContent">In the event TaxBrain goes through a business transition, such as a 
          merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its 
          assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be 
          part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email and 
          prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership 
          or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business 
          transition, the users’ personally identifiable information will 
          be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection 
          they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes 
          section.</p>
        <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Choice/Opt-out</span></p>
        <p class="LTContent">Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional 
          communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking 
          the link that will be supplied with each e-mail. </p>
        <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Links</span></p>
        <p class="LTContent">This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, 
          Petz Enterprises Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices

        <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Surveys &amp; Contests</span></p>
        <p class="LTContent">From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys 
          or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely 
          voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose 
          this information. The requested information typically includes contact 
          information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information 
          (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners 
          and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring 
          or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users’ personally 
          identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we 
          give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct 
          these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally 
          identifiable information for any secondary purposes. </p>

      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Security Information</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. 
        When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information 
        is protected both online and off-line.</p>
      <p class="LTContent"> TaxBrain account information is password-protected so that only the 
        registered owner of an account will have access to their personal information. 
        Account information may be updated by entering a user name and password 
        to gain access to the account. We strongly recommend that users do not 
        share their user name and password with anyone. PEI will never ask a user 
        for their user name or password via unsolicited phone call or e-mail. 
      </p>
      <p class="LTContent">Security is of utmost importance to Petz Enterprises and we use the latest 
        SSL technology to protect confidential information. </p>
      <p class="LTContent">While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, 
        we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. 
        All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information 
        mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need 
        the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk 
        or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
        identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected computers. 
        Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy 
        practices. Every [quarter], as well as any time new policies are added, 
        our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place 
        on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information 
        is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable 
        information are in a secure environment, behind a locked door in a locked 
        facility. </p>
      <p class="LTContent">If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users 
        can send an email to <a href="mailto:support@taxbrain.com">support@taxbrain.com</a>.</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating 
        Personal Information</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">We provide the opportunity to update or correct the contact and tax return 
        information provided to us. The tax return information and personally 
        identifiable information collected through this site is contained in tax 
        returns and in product registration information. Once a tax return has 
        been completed using the TaxBrain Web product, and directed that it be 
        electronically filed, it cannot be changed because the tax return has 
        become a legal record of the tax filing. Any changes made to a tax return 
        after it has already been electronically filed, and acknowledged by the 
        IRS, will generate a Form 1040X (amended return).</p>
      <p><span class="LTContentTITLES">Notification of Changes</span></p>
      <p class="LTContent">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
        to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate 
        so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use 
        it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use 
        information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information 
        was collected. </p>
      <p class="LTContent">If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable 
        information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection 
        we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether 
        or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if 
        users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated 
        their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal 
        information be used in this new manner. </p>
