We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google does not pass your personal information to Google Analytics.
  * We log requests and IP addresses in order to aggregate information on how much traffic we have, which pages users access, and whether there are any technical issues present. This information is collected solely for internal website management purposes and is never used in an attempt to identify individuals.

  * The Tax Foundation allows users who wish to receive email updates from us to submit their email and mailing addresses at [taxfoundation.org/subscribe/](https://taxfoundation.org/subscribe/). This information is then used to communicate only with individuals who have requested that we do so.

## We Respect the Privacy of Our Donors

We do not sell or rent this information, we do not provide information to commercial entities, nor do we ever provide phone numbers or e-mail addresses to anyone. **Donors  may opt out of such mailings by sending an e-mail message to ****[development@taxfoundation.org](mailto:development@taxfoundation.org)** **with their opt-out request**.
  * To the extent any donations are processed through a third-party service provider, our donors’ information will only be used for purposes necessary to process the donation.
