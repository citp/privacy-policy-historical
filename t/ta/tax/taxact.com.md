#### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know the number of emails that have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. **We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.** If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Changing and Deleting Personal Information" below.

#### Third Party Intermediaries

We use an outside credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We use an email delivery and marketing company to send emails that you have agreed to receive. Pixel tags and cookies are used in those email messages and at our Web site to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. For more information about the technology used to deliver our emails, or how to set your browser to reject cookies, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/).

We may use advertising companies to serve advertisements for or on our Web site. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or Web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices, click here (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>) and here (<http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html>). We do not share, rent or sell any personally identifiable information (including email address) to these companies.

On occasion, we will enter into a written contract with third party intermediary companies to help us to complete a business process, service, or function on our behalf. Without limitation, third party intermediaries may specialize in providing services such as: consulting or contracted development and maintenance, temporary workers, data processing, as well as direct and network marketing. These third party intermediaries may not use or retain personally identifiable information (including email address) for any secondary purpose. Additionally, they may not divulge, rent or sell any information (including email address) that may be gained through their relationship with 2nd Story Software.

2nd Story Software may also enter into marketing alliances and joint marketing relationships. 2nd Story Software's relationship with these companies shall not represent our endorsement for the products or services these companies offer; and, are only being made available within TaxACT.com to serve as added conveniences for our site's visitors. Unless you have supplied your consent, 2nd Story Software does not share your name and other personally identifiable information (including email address); and, 2nd Story Software shall never sell or rent any information that identifies you personally or individually. Otherwise, for a third party intermediary to obtain your contact information or personal data, you, yourself, will need to supply them with your information or become their direct customer. If you consent to share your personal information with a third party through TaxACT.com, you may unsubscribe by contacting us at any of the points of contact above.

Written agreements are established between 2nd Story Software and all third party intermediaries, as well as joint marketing and alliance companies. Each agreement strictly limits the use of your personally identifiable information to the scope of the contract. Contractual agreements, such as these, also stipulate safeguard, handling, and other precautionary care procedures, which are required to be taken. The contractual agreements we have in place and/or establish also govern confidentiality rights by limiting the information that we can share to include only aggregated statistical data.

When you see a small lock in the bottom right or left corner of your browser window, you know your data is being encrypted for transmission.

Electronically filed returns, which are further encrypted, are sent directly from 2nd Story Software to the IRS via a secure connection.

Like most Web servers, 2nd Story Software relies on log files. Log files include: Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), number of page views, platform type, date and time stamps, as well as the number visitors to our Web site. This information is used by 2nd Story Software to administer the site, analyze trends, track aggregated user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregated use only. Our Web site also uses tracking software which enables us to anonymously analyze trends occurring on our Web site. Personally identifiable information (including email address) is not stored, as the software does not collect personal information such as name, age, phone number, mailing address, email address or credit card numbers from visitors. For each visitor to our Web page, the software automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, IP address, access times, and pages viewed. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information (including email address).

TaxACT.com employs the use of cookies. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information (including email address) while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. If users reject the cookie, they will not be able to purchase products from the TaxACT.com Web site.

#### General Disclosure of Aggregated Information

2nd Story Software may disclose aggregate information to the IRS or other parties; however, we will not represent any information, which may be used to identify you personally or individually (including email address) without your expressed consent. Examples may include, but are not limited to: the total number of users served by a TaxACT product/service, general age group ratios, and other statistical data relating to tax preparation and electronic filing service.

#### Changes to our Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information (including email address) in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days.

If we merge with, or are acquired by another company, the resulting combined company will use the Personal Information you have provided as described in this policy. If we cease operation, your Personal Information may be transferred to and used by another company that offers similar or related products or services. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

#### Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
