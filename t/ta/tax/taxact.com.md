## Links to Other Websites

Our Services may contain links to third party websites. Each of these links is clearly identified and will direct you from TaxAct's website to a third-party site. We do not direct or oversee the policies, procedures, or other practices for companies other than TaxAct. We do not endorse the products and services that are offered by third party companies. Some of these third-party sites may collect information about you or request sensitive, personal information from you. If accessing a third party site via a link you will be subject to the policies and procedures that have been established by the third party. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what information is collected, how it is used, and how it is stored.

You can choose to permit or restrict third party websites that integrate with our Services. If you elect, you may enter your credentials to permit files to be imported to TaxAct.

Our Services includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly through our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Communications and Opt-Out Options

We may periodically send you communications or otherwise contact you about new products, services, or upcoming events. You may choose to be removed from our email mailing list by following the instructions in those emails or by contacting TaxAct using one of the methods listed at the top of this page (email, phone, or mail) to request that you be removed from our marketing list. Note, however, that even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications, we will still contact you for non-marketing purposes (such as account information, feedback or research purposes, legal notices, account security, bug alerts, and/or changes that may impact your ability to use TaxAct products and services).

Upon request (see “For Further Information” section), TaxAct will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You can access, correct or deactivate your account information by visiting www.taxact.com and selecting "Sign In" or by contacting us at the email address provided above. In certain jurisdictions you have the right to request access and receive information about the Personal Information we maintain about you, even if you are not a registered user, to update and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, or to have the information deleted. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

If you e-file your tax return, you will not be able to update your tax return information once your tax return has been filed, unless the IRS rejects the return. You may check if your return has been accepted or rejected by selecting [Check e-file status](https://web.archive.org/ef/efile-center).

If you delete or deactivate your account, you may no longer be able to access any of the information associated with that account including information you provided through associated applications or other Services. If you choose an available option to deactivate your account, rather than deleting your account, we retain your account information in our archives even though it is no longer accessible online. We retain all printed or e-filed returns and related information as necessary to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

After the tax return extension filing deadline, all TaxAct tax returns are archived. We provide the ability for you to access your archived return in certain circumstances.

## Security Measures

We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, alteration and destruction by using industry standard safeguards, procedures, and practices. These safeguards include physical, logical and technical protections for physical security; information security; and additional measures to restrict access to data we hold in physical and electronic forms. For example, we restrict access to personal information to those on a need to know basis and we encrypt credit card information when it's transmitted to us. Your access to the Services is password-protected with complex password requirements, security questions, and authentication by email or mobile phone. You should use a unique password and should not share your password with anyone. Additional details on our security measures can be found here: [https://www.taxact.com/Security/](https://web.archive.org/security).
