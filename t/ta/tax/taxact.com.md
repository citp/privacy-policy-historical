## Disclosure of Information

We disclose Tax Return Information in accordance with your requests, such as when you direct us to file a tax return with the IRS or to a state taxing authority. 

In certain situations, TaxAct may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We also may share information about you as follows:

  * With vendors, consultants and other service providers who are required to use and disclose such information only to perform services on our behalf; 
  * To taxing authorities, law enforcement, government agencies and others if we believe disclosure is in accordance with any applicable law, regulation or legal process, or as otherwise required by any applicable law, rule or regulation;
  * If we believe your actions are inconsistent with the spirit or language of our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of TaxAct or others; and
  * In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.



We may share your information with employees of our affiliated companies for purposes of providing and maintaining the Services.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Services may contain links to third party websites. Each of these links is clearly identified. We do not direct or oversee the policies, procedures, or other practices for companies other than TaxAct. We do not endorse the products and services that are offered by third party companies. Some of these third-party sites may collect information about you or request sensitive, personal information from you. If accessing a third party site via a link you will be subject to the policies and procedures that have been established by the third party. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what information is collected, how it is used, and how it is stored.

Our Services includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly through our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Your Choices

We may periodically send you communications about new products, services, or upcoming events. You may choose to be removed from our email mailing list by following the instructions in those emails or by contacting TaxAct using one of the methods listed at the top of this page (email, phone, or mail) to request that you be removed from our marketing list. Note, however, that even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications, we will still contact you for non-marketing purposes (such as account information, legal notices, account security, bug alerts, and/or changes that may impact your ability to use TaxAct products and services).

Upon request TaxAct will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You can access, correct or deactivate your account information by visiting www.taxact.com and selecting "My Account" in top right-hand corner of the home page or by contacting us at the email address provided above. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. If you e-file your tax return, you will not be able to update your tax return information once your tax return has been filed, unless the IRS rejects the return. You may check if your return has been accepted or rejected by accessing [Check e-file status](https://web.archive.org/ef/efile-center).

If you deactivate your account, you will no longer be able to access any of the information associated with that account including information you provided through associated applications, such as Donation Assistant, or other Services. If you choose to deactivate your account, we retain your account information in our archives even though it is no longer accessible online. We retain all e-filed returns and related information as necessary to comply with our legal and contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

After the tax return extension filing deadline, all TaxAct tax returns are archived. We provide the ability for you to access your archived return in certain circumstances for a charge.

## Security Measures

We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration by using appropriate and generally accepted safeguards, procedures, and practices. These safeguards include programs and specifications for physical security; computer and communication security measures; and other measures to restrict access to the data we hold in physical and electronic forms. For example, your sensitive information, such as credit card information, is encrypted when it is transmitted to us. Your access to the Services is password-protected. You should use a unique password and should not share your password with anyone.
