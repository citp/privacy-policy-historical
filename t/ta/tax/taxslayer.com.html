      information are on a secure server.&nbsp; All steps are taken to safeguard your
      information.<p></p>
     

	<br>
	<strong>Information Gathering</strong>
	<br>
    The information we gather, in addition to your tax return, includes:<br>  
	• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Credit Card</strong> including:
	<br>
        Cardholder's name, credit card type, credit card number, expiration date, billing address, email address.<br>

        We use this information once to send a message to your friend.&nbsp; We do not share any information for our "Tell A Friend" page and this information is not saved.
	
	<p><strong>Sharing Information</strong>
	<br>
	• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Within TaxSlayer Corporate Family</strong>
	<br>
	We may share information about you and the products and services you have purchased from us, among members of the TaxSlayer Corporate family and our parent company of Rhodes Financial Services, all of whom follow our Privacy Policy.  However, this information will not be provided to third parties outside or corporate family, except as noted below:
	<br>
	• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>With Service Providers</strong>
	<br>
	In some cases, we employ service providers to provide a product you order, to fulfill a service you request, or to market one of our products or services.  Examples include delivering downloadable products, offering online software applications, or sending e-mails on our behalf.  While this may require us to share information,  these service providers are strictly prohibited from using your information other than to act on our behalf.
	<br>
	• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>For Legal Reasons</strong>

	</p><p><strong>Our Former Customers</strong>
	<br> Even if you are no longer a TaxSlayer customer, our Privacy Policy will continue to apply to you.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Our Security Practices and Information Accuracy</strong>
	<br> We take every step available to safeguard customer information.  All forms accepting user information are processed on our secure servers.
	</p>
	<p>TaxSlayer's electronic filing process is different than most in the fact that you download our software and install it on your personal PC or you may file your return on a Web based page.  Once you have completed the return on your personal PC, you are asked to transmit the return to TaxSlayer's secure website.  In both the download and the web versions, the tax return file is encrypted to avoid any unwanted detection.  Immediately after the files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's website, they are moved to a different location providing less likelihood of unwanted intervention.  They are again moved a third time to begin processing.  All acknowledgements are handled by e-mail with only general information given.  Acknowledgements can also be retrieved via our website again without general information provided. (Example: IRS accepted or rejected, acceptance date, etc.) Confidential information such as refund amounts, names, addresses, and account numbers are not displayed or e-mailed.
	</p>
	<p>Incomplete tax returns or returns that are not accepted by the IRS will be deleted.
	</p>
	<p>Upon deletion of any return, while online, will cause all information on that return to be deleted.
	</p>

	<p>We strive to keep our customer information as accurate and complete as we can.  If you believe any of the information about you is not accurate, please let us know.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Access to Personal Information:</strong></p><p>
         Personal Information is accessible for 1 year online, through our main web site, <a href="http://www.taxslayer.com">www.taxslayer.com</a>.&nbsp; It may be accessed by clicking on, CLICK HERE IF YOU HAVE ALREADY STARTED A WEB RETURN.&nbsp;
         For your convenience, this information will also be stored for 2 years following, and may be requested via email, at <a href="mailto:Sales@TaxSlayer.com">Sales@TaxSlayer.com</a>.


	</p><p><strong>Other Information</strong>
	<br>The Privacy Policy applies to products and services of TaxSlayer.com, online.&nbsp;Please note that the BBOnLine Privacy Seal only covers information collected through our TaxSlayer website.&nbsp; It does not cover personal information gathered through the TaxSlayer download software.&nbsp; We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy, and any of the policies described above, at any time.
         Any changes to our policy will be immediately posted and made available to consumers at our website and these changes will not take effect for 15 days after their initial posting.&nbsp; We will also email users with this information.&nbsp; 
  The examples contained within this Privacy Policy are illustrations; they are not intended to be exclusive.
