              <p><strong>Sharing Information</strong></p>
              <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Within TaxSlayer Corporate Family</strong> <br>
                We may share information about you and the products and services
                  you have purchased from us, among members of the TaxSlayer
                  Corporate family and our parent company of Rhodes Financial
                  Services, all of whom follow our Privacy Policy. However, this
                  information will not be provided to third parties outside or
                  corporate family, except as noted below: <br>
                • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>With Our Service Providers</strong> <br>
                In some cases, we employ service providers to provide a product
                you order, to fulfill a service you request, or to market one
                of our products or services. Examples include delivering downloadable
                products, offering online software applications, or sending e-mails
                on our behalf. While this may require us to share information,
                these service providers are strictly prohibited from using your
                information other than to act on our behalf. <br>
                • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>For Legal Reasons</strong> <br>
                We may be required to provide information about you to third
                parties outside of the TaxSlayer corporate family without your
                consent as provided by law, such as, to respond to a subpoena
                or court order, judicial process or regulatory authorities, to
                protect against fraud. <br>
                • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>In Case of Sale of Company</strong> <br>
                Your information may be transferred in connection with a proposed
                or actual sale, merger, or transfer of all or a portion of a
                business or operating unit. </p>
              <p><strong>Links</strong>
              </p><p>As a service to our customers, we have installed links to
                  various tax agencies/services. &nbsp; These include IRS.Gov, and various state agencies and organizations.
                  The links provided are maintained by these separate entities
                  and are not the property of, or affiliated with, Taxslayer.com. 
              </p><p><strong>Our Former Customers</strong> </p>
              <p>Even if you are no longer a TaxSlayer customer, our Privacy
                Policy will continue to apply to you. </p>
              <p><strong>Our Security Practices and Information Accuracy</strong> </p>
              <p>We take every step available to safeguard customer information.
                All forms accepting user information are processed on our secure
                servers. </p>
              <p>TaxSlayer's electronic filing process is different than most
                in the fact that you download our software and install it on
                your personal PC or you may file your return on a Web based page.
                Once you have completed the return on your personal PC, you are
                asked to transmit the return to TaxSlayer's secure website. In
                both the download and the web versions, the tax return file is
                encrypted to avoid any unwanted detection. Immediately after
                the files are transmitted to TaxSlayer's website, they are moved
                to a different location providing less likelihood of unwanted
                intervention. They are again moved a third time to begin processing.
                All acknowledgements are handled by e-mail with only general
                information given. Acknowledgements can also be retrieved via
                our website again without general information provided. (Example:
                IRS accepted or rejected, acceptance date, etc.) Confidential
                information such as refund amounts, names, addresses, and account
                numbers are not displayed or e-mailed. </p>
              <p>Incomplete tax returns or returns that are not accepted by the
                IRS will be deleted. </p>
              <p>We strive to keep our customer information as accurate and complete
                as we can. If you believe any of the information about you is
                not accurate, please let us know. </p>
              <p><strong>Access to Personal Information:</strong>
              </p><p> Personal Information is accessible online through
                                Oct. 15th 2006. Any return e-filed through TaxSlayer.com
                                will be available only in PDF format (fees may
                                apply).
