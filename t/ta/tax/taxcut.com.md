# TaxCut: Privacy Statement

**H &R BLOCK E-SOLUTIONS PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR SOFTWARE**

Protecting your privacy is fundamental to our business at Block Financial Corporation (H&R Block e-solutions). We honor all applicable privacy regulations, and we further strive to operate our business in a manner that justifies your choice of H&R Block products and services. This statement explains the types of information we may collect from you, and informs you how we may use or disclose that information. 

**Who This Policy Covers**

This statement applies to personal information we collect when you use software produced by Block Financial Corporation, including TaxCut®, H&R Block DeductionPro, Kiplinger's WILLPower, Kiplinger's Home and Business Attorney, and other titles that may be produced by us. This policy does not apply to your use of tax preparation services at retail offices of H&R Block, to H&R Block Web-based tax preparation services, or to our affiliates, which are companies related to Block Financial Corporation by common ownership or control, because these companies may be subject to different regulations and/or may have different operating practices. Our affiliates include, but are not limited to, H&R Block Services, Inc., H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc. and H&R Block Mortgage Corp. 

**Information We Collect**

  * If you electronically file your tax return, we may collect personal information so that we may transmit your tax return to the Internal Revenue Service or state revenue agencies. This information, referred to in this policy as "tax return information," includes, for example, your name, address and certain other data such as your social security number, income and deductions data, and other information about you and your dependents that you provide to file your tax return.
  * We may collect other information in connection with transactions beyond tax return filing that you complete or propose to complete with us or our affiliates. This information may include, for example, your name, address and certain other "nonpublic personal information" such as checking, debit and credit account numbers, balances and payment history, income, assets, and social security number. This information may also include system information, such as your operating system version, internet protocol (IP) address and the number of times you electronically file using the software. Certain system information is required to be collected for the Internal Revenue Service in connection with electronic filing. We obtain system information through your use of TaxCut software only if you electronically file your tax return.
  * We may collect information about you from the IRS and other third parties such as credit reporting agencies in connection with transactions you complete or propose to complete with us, our affiliates, or non affiliated third parties. This could include, for example, information about the status of your tax return, tax refund, or tax refund loans.
  * We, our affiliates, or non-affiliated third parties with whom we have business relationships may collect information about you when you inquire about services or request information from us, or when you enter our contests, seek technical support, submit rebate forms, or register your software. This information may include, for example, your name, telephone number, mailing address and e-mail address, system information and configuration, account number and demographic information.
  * We may collect information from your browser or computer, when you visit the Web sites relating to H&R Block software offerings, use links from within our software in connection with your browser, or when you register your software. We also may collect information through Internet cookies, clear GIFs and other technologies, such as referring pages, Internet protocol address, pages visited and time spent on our site. The information we collect is used to enhance and improve your experience on our site.



**What Are Log Files, Cookies and Clear GIFs?**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that our Web server transfers to your computer via your Web browser. Internet cookies allow us to customize our Web site for you. Through the use of cookies we can, for example, display only those items that may be of interest to you or make it easier for you to access such things as your account information. In most cases, however, information we collect through Internet cookies does not identify you personally.

We also employ a software technology called clear GIFs, also known as Web beacons. These help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Clear GIFs are not tied to users' personally identifiable information.

Like most standard Web site servers, H&R Block uses log files. Log files track Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We utilize this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable users to file or transmit tax returns to the Internal Revenue Service.

**How We May Disclose Your Information**

H&R Block’s disclosure of your information is controlled by Section 7216 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of 1999, certain other laws, and H&R Block policies.

Section 7216 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that we have your consent ("opt in") before we disclose your tax return information to affiliates or third parties except the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), law enforcement, and certain other lawful purposes. Some information that is identical to some of your tax return information, such as name and address, may not be subject to Section 7216 if we also collect this information for purposes other than filing your tax return.

We may disclose your information as described below where you have provided consent under Section 7216, or as otherwise permitted by applicable laws:

  * We may disclose your information to H&R Block affiliates engaged in banking, investment, insurance or other financial services activities in order to provide you with service enhancements and product opportunities that we believe may interest you.
  * We may disclose your information to service providers who perform business functions on our behalf, or to financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. Services such organizations could perform on our behalf may include, for example, check printing, data processing and analysis, contest supervision, and surface or e-mail production. We require all H&R Block service providers and joint marketers to have written contracts with us that specify appropriate use of your information, require them to safeguard your data, and prohibit them from making unauthorized or unlawful use of your information.
  * We may disclose your name, address, and email address, along with demographic, computer system, or lifestyle information (but not tax return information) we collect through software product registration to select third parties including non-financial companies, such as direct marketers and retailers, and financial companies, such as insurance companies. You may opt-out of these disclosures by following the procedures set forth below under the heading "How You May Control the Use or Disclosure of Your Information", or by designating your preferences during the software registration process.
  * We may disclose your information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties for other purposes permitted or required by law. Such purposes may include, for example, processing or fulfilling a service you request, or selling or transferring our business or assets.
  * H&R Block's software and Web sites may contain links to third party Web sites or offers for services from third parties. Examples may include offers for tax refund loans or other loans offered through a third party bank, and promotions for capital gains or investment software, tools or services. For any such third party products or services, you should carefully read the privacy policies of the third parties providing such products or services. This privacy statement applies solely to services provided by H&R Block, and not products or services offered by a third party.
  * We may disclose your information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties when we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is required by law. This may occur in connection with a court order, legal process, or other judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding that produces a request for information from H&R Block.



**How We Protect Your Information**

H&R Block maintains policies and procedures designed to restrict access to your personal information in several ways. These include programs and specifications for physical security and records retention and disposal; computer and communication security measures reflected in system design, password protection, and data management practices; and other measures to restrict access to the data we hold in physical and electronic forms.

**How You May Control Use and Disclosure of Your Information**

We provide you with choice and control over the use or disclosure of your personal information as follows:

If You Do Not Want Us to Share your Nonpublic Personal Information with Non-Affiliated Third Parties. If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to non-affiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures. You may direct us not to make those disclosures, other than disclosures permitted or required by law. If you wish to opt out of disclosures to non-affiliated third parties, you may call 1-888-482-9288 or visit the following Web page: http://www.taxcut.com/privacy/optout.html. If you are a resident of any state that requires H&R Block to obtain your opt-in consent to share personal information with third parties, this paragraph does not apply to you.

_If You Do Not Want to be Contacted by H &R Block._ If at any time you wish to limit receiving offers or promotions directly from H&R Block, you may call 1-888-482-9288 or visit [http://www.taxcut.com/privacy/optout.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20040607011404id_/http://www.taxcut.com/privacy/optout.html) on the Web. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. It may still be necessary for H&R Block to send you information about any transactions or accounts you have with us or our affiliates, including electronic filing, software purchases, product support, or other online services.
