# Privacy Policy

**Overview:** TASER International ( **“TASER”** ) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and TASER takes your privacy seriously. TASER created this Privacy Policy Statement ( **“Statement”** ) in order to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

**Privacy Policy Coverage:** This Statement covers TASER’s collection of personal information that TASER gathers when you are on TASER International websites. It does not apply to information collected and stored by a means other than these websites or practices of third parties that TASER does not own or control, or to individuals that TASER does not employ or manage. By accessing the TASER International websites, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Statement.

Access to information about customers collected from the TASER International websites is restricted to TASER and third parties that need access to customer information in order to provide TASER operational or other support services, TASER product information or product, service or upgrade offers, or as may be required by law. TASER does not distribute, sell or rent any personal information collected via its websites. This is also true for personal information (email address, postal address, etc.) sent to the websites’ email addresses. TASER does not send unsolicited emails to users of its sites. The transmission of personal information entered via the sites’ forms is protected by security features.

**TASER’s Personal Information Collection and Purpose:** TASER’s primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. TASER takes reasonable precautions to protect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction of personal information. We collect the following types of information from our customers:

**(A) Information You Provide to Us:**

TASER collects identifying information when you use the TASER International websites, and when you enter promotions or contests. For example, we may require customers who register to use the TASER International websites to give us the following personal information: their name, Company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the identity of users within the organization that will be using the TASER International websites. When you initially express interest in obtaining additional information about the TASER International websites, or when you register on the TASER International websites, we may also ask for additional types of personal information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company or agency information. We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized experience or verify your passwords.

All financial and billing information that we collect from you is used for the purposes of checking your qualifications as a prospective customer and billing you for purchases. TASER may use a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card and billing processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card and billing processing.

If you are a registered user of the TASER International websites, please note that some information about you may remain in our records.
