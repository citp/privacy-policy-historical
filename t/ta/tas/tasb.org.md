# TASB Website Privacy Policy

**General**

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) covers how the Texas Association of School Boards, Inc. (“TASB”) handles personal information collected and received from or through the TASB Website and our use of information collected about you through our social media pages (the TASB Website and social media pages are referred to herein as the “Site”). As used in this Policy, the term “TASB” shall also include its wholly-owned subsidiary (First Public, LLC) and all affiliated entities to which TASB or its subsidiary provides website services on this Site (e.g., TASB Legal Assistance Fund, TASB Risk Management Fund, The Local Government Purchasing Cooperative, TASB Energy Cooperative, Lone Star Investment Pool, and TASB Supplemental Employee Benefits Cooperative).

Personal information is information about you that identifies you individually—such as your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number—that might not be publicly available. This Policy does not apply to the practice of entities or people that TASB does not own, control, employ, or manage.

**Accessing the Site and Personal Information Collection**

You are not required to be a TASB member or to provide personal information to access certain parts of the Site. When you access the Site without actively providing any personal information, we collect limited technical information, such as your IP address. We also use cookies and analytics as described below. 

Certain parts of the Site do require that you provide us with personal information for access to or use of those parts. For example, if you register to use a portion of the Site that is password-protected, you may be required to provide information as described in the “Registration and Forms” section below. 

**Cookies**

TASB uses cookies (text files placed on your hard drive by a web server) to help personalize and maximize your experience and time online. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to your computer and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. We use cookies to improve the Site and to facilitate your use of the Site. (Read more about how to manage cookies in [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://web.archive.org/Copyright/Terms-and-Conditions-of-Use.aspx).)

**Registration and Forms**

From the Site, you may register to attend events or obtain services. These registrations may require you to provide the following:

  * Contact information such as your name and e-mail address
  * Demographic information such as ZIP Code and date of birth
  * Payment information to invoice for products or services purchased



We may use this information to effect transactions or provide services for which the information was provided, to contact you with additional information, and to analyze use of our Site and services.

**Online Forums and Message Boards**

The Site makes forums and message boards available to our members. Information you disclose in these areas may become public, so exercise caution when deciding what information to disclose.

**Links**

The Site contains links to other websites. TASB is not responsible for the privacy practices of sites other than our own. We encourage you to be aware of the privacy statements on other websites and to read these statements.

**Protection of Information**

Some areas of the Website are secured and can only be accessed using unique login credentials. You must have a specific user identifier (user ID) and password to access resources through any password-protected portions of the Site. Your login credentials and password are for your use only and strictly confidential. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of those credentials, and are responsible for all activity occurring on the Site using your login credentials and password. You are strictly prohibited from any sharing of your login credentials and/or password with any other person(s) and from any use of your login credentials other than for your use of the Site in compliance with these Terms. 

**Online Purchases**

TASB uses a third-party service provider site to effect purchases of materials offered on the Site. That service provider uses industry-standard practices and software to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal, identifying information. Firewalls and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption protect credit card information you make available for any online purchases. Please note, however, that no form of electronic communication is 100 percent secure, and you should use caution whenever providing personal information online.

**Social Media**

The collection and use of information on social media websites and applications are governed by their own privacy policies. Please remember that any information posted on or through the TASB pages such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest, or on other social media pages or channels, is subject to the policies and practices of the applicable social media channel.

We may receive personal information from a social media site platform or application when you connect through a social media feed, post content, or otherwise interact with us using social media tools. For example, we may receive basic Facebook account information (name, e‑mail, gender, birthday, current city, and profile picture URL) through Facebook. Also, when you “like” us, or send a “Tweet” to us through a social media channel, we may receive your username, handle, and any other available personal information from the social media site or application. All information received from social media sites and applications is treated and used in the same manner and for the same purposes as described in this Policy with respect to similar information we obtain through the Site. 

**Third-Party Data Collection/Online Tracking**

We use service providers such as Google Analytics, Google Webmaster, Google Adwords, and Kentico to help us understand and improve the usage of the Site and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Google Analytics may use cookies, your IP address or an anonymous identifier as well as certain information from your browser, together with other non-personal information about your visits to our Site and other websites, so that we, Google, or third parties may provide you with advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on our Site and other websites (including through Google search results pages) and/or to provide analytical information about our Site. If you would like more information about advertising networks, including choices about the use of information by Google and other companies for multi-site advertising purposes, go to www.networkadvertising.org and www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Also, Google offers a Google Analytics browser add-on (designed to be compatible only with certain browsers) to provide website visitors the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics. That add-on may be obtained [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en); other Google privacy controls are available [here](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html); and you can manage your Google ad settings [here](http://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCihjszu4AekeFaO6L8tG9geDwXg8hIUhKPu2vgwE8apxg1K7r4g8NcFvpbjbJDwto7Cdn72U_5JDdmBfIc_zEeCJLW5fED2SCTZy-CQ8vEL0s7-RpvM_h2L4LNaS7pa35hJOZLS2Sq_UvNLj1WkRBcjk4p-6xs9zWlVJHRF5DvRZyHke0p6inokF0FHgrHnrNjQYAa0). 

Currently, various Internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that uses a DNT header to indicate the DNT preference setting on the browser. TASB does not track your activity over time and across different websites or online services, and thus we do not currently respond to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to the Site. We do not permit our third-party service providers to collect information from the Site for other websites or for their own purposes other than as described in this Policy.

**Children’s Privacy**

We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, and use of personal information of minors under the age of 18, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

We do not collect personal information from minors under the age of 18. Individuals under the age of 18 are not permitted to use the Site without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an online account or to place orders or provide personal information through the Site. If we learn that someone under the age of 18 has provided any personal information through the Site, we will remove and permanently delete that information as soon as reasonably possible.

If you are a parent or guardian who believes that your minor under the age of 18 has submitted personal information or other information to us without your consent, please contact us using the contact information provided below. Once we verify that you are the parent or legal guardian, we will cooperate with you to discuss what, if any, personal information we have collected about your child and how that information may have been shared or used.

**Changes to This Statement**

TASB reserves the right to change this privacy statement at any time. Notification of changes will be posted on the Site. Because these changes may affect your personal information, we suggest that you look for information regarding changes on a regular basis and review the changes as soon as they are published on the website.

**Correcting Your Information**

We strive to assure the correctness of the information we maintain. If the information we have about you is inaccurate, we will correct the information in a manner as timely as possible. To provide us with corrections, please contact us in any of the following ways:

  * Send an e-mail message with corrections to [webmaster@tasb.org](mailto:webmaster@tasb.org).
  * Send mail with corrections to P.O. Box 400, Austin, Texas 78767.
  * Call us at 512-467-0222.



**Security**

We employ reasonable security methods to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of your information. However, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while we try to protect your information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
