<h2>Cookies, and TaskRabbit.com's use thereof</h2>
<p class="tiny">TaskRabbit.com collects anonymous information through cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data containing a unique identification number that is sent to your browser from a Web server, and is stored on your computer's hard drive. The unique ID number identifies your browser to TaskRabbit.com's computers whenever you visit. Cookies do not enable anyone to access personally identifiable information that you have not already given us. TaskRabbit.com primarily uses cookies to connect members with account information stored on TaskRabbit.com's computers. This helps TaskRabbit.com deliver better and more personalized service. TaskRabbit.com also uses cookies to estimate TaskRabbit.com's audience size for advertisers; to assist in processing items in your shopping basket; to track the number of entries in TaskRabbit.com promotions, sweepstakes and contests; to identify the areas of the site you visit; to hold session information; and to track user preferences.</p>
<p class="tiny">Cookies are part of the technology implemented by your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to either notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse them all together.</p>
<p class="tiny">TaskRabbit.com relies on cookies to preserve the TaskRabbit.com identity you have created while logged on. If you choose to not accept cookies, you cannot participate as a registered, signed-in member.</p>
<p class="tiny">You should be aware that TaskRabbit.com's advertisers sometimes use banner ads to give you their own cookies. If you want to understand how and why an advertiser uses cookies, check the company's site for their privacy statement. TaskRabbit.com is not responsible for any issues that may arise regarding the Privacy Policies of any of its affiliates or advertiser. By using this site, you do hereby agree to hold TaskRabbit.com harmless from any claims and/or damages that may arise from the policies and/or practices (or lack thereof) of any of its affiliates and/or advertisers.</p>

<h2>TaskRabbit.com's use of member information</h2>
<p class="tiny">Two things drive TaskRabbit.com's decisions regarding the use of information collected from TaskRabbit.com members: 1) improving user experience by offering personalized services, content and advertising, and 2) market research.</p>
<p class="tiny">Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and TaskRabbit.com believes that targeted advertising enhances this experience. TaskRabbit.com uses information collected from TaskRabbit.com members to place ads where they believe interested parties will see them.</p>
<p class="tiny">In addition to banner ads, TaskRabbit.com may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide.</p>

<p class="tiny">TaskRabbit.com may analyze information provided directly by you, or obtained through cookies or third parties to direct services and content based on your interests. TaskRabbit.com reserves the right to collect market research data in order to generate sales to corporate clients. However, market research data may be used at the aggregate level to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Improve the likelihood of a sale to a group of TaskRabbit.com members</li>
  <li>Increase the likelihood that a group's experience on TaskRabbit.com is relevant to its interests as a whole</li>
  <li>Formulate group-level statistical models that are used to accomplish goal #2 (above).</li>
</ol>

<p class="tiny">TaskRabbit.com's market research may be collected in some of the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Among individuals who opt-in to take surveys during the registration process or while on TaskRabbit.com (those who sign up are contacted and take surveys through email)</li>
  <li>Through surveys that we publicly post on TaskRabbit.com (it is never mandatory to answer these surveys)</li>
  <li>Through contests that are offered on the site</li>
  <li>Through general use of the site</li>
</ol>

<p class="tiny">TaskRabbit.com uses data at the individual level to sell products and services to TaskRabbit.com members who express an interest in these products and services, through a poll for example, or to members who can be presumed to have an interest based on results from a statistical analysis.</p>

<h2>Information logged by TaskRabbit.com</h2>
<p class="tiny">When you visit websites on the Internet, your browser automatically transmits information to the sites you visit throughout every visit. Examples of such information include referral data (URL of the Web page you were on before coming to TaskRabbit.com), IP address, and your browser version. We collect this information to help improve our services and moderate the site. All the information that is automatically submitted by your browser is considered anonymous.</p>
<p class="tiny">TaskRabbit.com also logs information you submit through registration, forms for optional programs, surveys and other entries, cookie data and communications transmitted through TaskRabbit.com applications. Only authorized TaskRabbit.com staff members have access to your information in its entirety. Other employees may have access to portions of this information if it pertains to their job duties.</p>

<h2>What is TaskRabbit.com's information retention policy?</h2>
<p class="tiny">To preserve the integrity of our databases, standard procedure calls for us to retain information submitted by members for an indefinite length of time. TaskRabbit.com understands your submissions as consent to store all your information in one place for this indefinite length of time, if we so wish. If required by law, as is the case to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will nullify member information by erasing it from our database. We will also respond to written member requests to nullify account information. If you wish to make such a request, which requires that we verify your identity, or if you have any questions regarding this policy, contact TaskRabbit.com at help@taskrabbit.com. Also, by using this site, you do hereby represent and warrant that you understand and agree that all information submitted by you to TaskRabbit.com becomes the property of TaskRabbit.com and may be used in the sole discretion of TaskRabbit.com in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</p>

<h2>TaskRabbit.com security of collected information</h2>
<p class="tiny">Your TaskRabbit.com Profile is password-protected so that only you and authorized TaskRabbit.com employees have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. If someone who represents to you they are TaskRabbit.com staff asks for any personal account information, including password, check their URL. If it doesn't say they are help@taskrabbit.com, they're not. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your TaskRabbit.com account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.</p>
<p class="tiny">TaskRabbit.com makes every effort to ensure that your information is secure on its system. Extremely sensitive information, like credit card numbers, is always transmitted in encrypted form. Only certain authorized TaskRabbit.com employees can access this information, and then only if it is relevant to their job duties. TaskRabbit.com has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing Web security and making sure that every TaskRabbit.com employee is aware of our security practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, TaskRabbit.com cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. If you have any further questions on this issue, refer to the site Terms of Use. TaskRabbit.com expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information you submit to this site.</p>

<h2>With whom does TaskRabbit.com share information?</h2>
<p class="tiny">When you submit information to TaskRabbit.com, it is generally collected, processed and maintained solely by us. Sometimes we may allow partner companies to collect information about members from us or directly from you (through their Web site). When TaskRabbit.com is the source, it is usually so that we can provide a service with a partner. We choose to work with companies that we believe to be upstanding and that we believe will treat your information responsibly. But, since we don't own these companies, we can't speak for them on privacy issues. Before telling them about yourself, check out their privacy statements. If you are not satisfied with their information practices, you can choose to not use their service.</p>
<p class="tiny">Below is a summary of some of the situations in which TaskRabbit.com might share some of the information that we collect from users:</p>

<h2>Co-Branding</h2>
<p class="tiny">Some of our services, such as TaskRabbit.com email, are offered in conjunction with partner companies. In order to provide these services, TaskRabbit.com may choose to share some of you user data (e.g., including, but not limited to, user name and email address).</p>

<h2>Content Partners</h2>
<p class="tiny">Some TaskRabbit.com content is "sponsored by" or "presented by" other companies. TaskRabbit.com typically shares market research data (how the sponsorship performed, names of contest winners, etc.) collected on the site or via email surveys with these partners. This information is typically aggregate and not linked to specific users.</p>

<h2>Partner Sponsorships</h2>
<p class="tiny">Partners may sponsor promotions, contests and sweepstakes that require you to reveal details such as your name, address or phone number. Always check their privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you don't want these sponsors to have your personal information, you can choose to not participate.</p>
<p class="tiny">When visitors come to TaskRabbit.com, they may receive cookies from TaskRabbit.com's sponsors; this information is typically not shared with TaskRabbit.com. This privacy statement does not address the information practices of our advertisers. You should read the privacy statements of all third-party sites, as their privacy policies may differ from TaskRabbit.com's.</p>
<p class="tiny">Finally, TaskRabbit.com reserves the right to disclose user information from both private and public areas of the site at our discretion to anyone or no one at all, if required by law or if given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interference with the rights of TaskRabbit.com members or the general public, or with TaskRabbit.com's rights of property. Please be advised, however, that all information submitted by you to TaskRabbit.com becomes the property of TaskRabbit.com. By submitting this information, you do hereby agree to allow TaskRabbit.com to use such information at its sole discretion pursuant to the terms of the Terms of use.</p>
<p class="tiny">Specifically, we may also share certain information about you with those of our vendors who are responsible for handling your account or performing other necessary services that you require. Although we may share sensitive financial information (i.e., credit card numbers, banking information), security information (e.g., account passwords) and personal communications (e.g., personal e-mail messages) with such vendors where necessary and appropriate, we will not share such information with other third parties, except in response to formal requests (e.g., subpoena or court order) made in connection with litigation or arbitration proceedings directly relating to a domain name registration or other services we provide.</p>
<p class="tiny">Additionally, we may share the information stored in our database, as well as other information that is not of a sensitive nature, with carefully selected business partners, including those who offer services that complement those provided by us or which may otherwise be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share information about you with our business partners, you may send us an e-mail at help@taskrabbit.com. Include the word "privacy" in the subject line of the e-mail and all your registration information in the body of the e-mail. Finally, TaskRabbit.com reserves the right to transfer, sell and/or distribute all information collected on its sight for any purpose, including, but not limited to, for satisfaction of any debt or upon liquidation of the company should such a situation arise.</p>

<h2>TaskRabbit.com's opt-in/out policy</h2>
<p class="tiny">During registration you choose whether to receive correspondence from either TaskRabbit.com or its partners and whether you want to participate in a variety of TaskRabbit.com programs. This information remains on your Profile where you can, at any point, easily edit it to indicate that you have changed your mind. After logging on, click on "edit profile" on the bottom of any page. Then click on "email alerts," and make your selections.  If you purchase anything through TaskRabbit.com, we may occasionally contact you with information about special events, sales, and activities. You always have the option to ask TaskRabbit.com not to contact you with this information again. As for promotions, contests, submission opportunities and programs, you will not be included unless you opt-in.</p>
<p class="tiny">If you receive unsolicited email from a TaskRabbit.com domain, please contact us at help@taskrabbit.com.</p>

<h2>How can TaskRabbit.com members edit their information?</h2>
<p class="tiny">TaskRabbit.com believes strongly in giving you the ability to access and edit your personal information. To update your personal info, click My Account at the top of any page. There you can view, update and correct your account information. You may edit your profile at any time -- all you need is your username and password.</p>
<p class="tiny">So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under 18 are not allowed to register as TaskRabbit.com members, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our members' ages. Please contact us at help@taskrabbit.com to find out how to change information you cannot access through your Profile.</p>
<p class="tiny">Our databases automatically update any personal information you edit in your profile, or that you request we edit. Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other means remain in our databases and become the property of TaskRabbit.com upon submission. Keep this in mind if you decide to communicate personal information through any of these applications.</p>

<h2>Notification of changes</h2>
<p class="tiny">TaskRabbit.com's security and privacy policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This policy might change as TaskRabbit.com updates and expands its services. TaskRabbit.com will contact you via email and will post notification if there are any material changes in its privacy practices. TaskRabbit.com also encourages you to review this privacy policy periodically. By using the site, you do hereby represent and warrant that you have read, understand and agree to all terms of this Privacy Policy and Terms of use. Each time you use the site, you agree to all terms set forth by TaskRabbit.com in both its Privacy Policy and Terms of use and any other policies published by TaskRabbit.com on the site.
