For example, where you have provided your consent to receive marketing emails from us. You can withdraw your marketing consent at any time, including by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email or through your email preferences on your profile tab, when you are logged into your account.

**Our legitimate interests:**

Where it is necessary for us to understand our customers, promote our services and operate our site efficiently for the provision of our services. For example, we will rely on our legitimate interest when we carry out marketing analysis to understand our customers to determine what marketing communications may be relevant to them. It is also in our legitimate interest to analyse what content has been viewed on our site and apps, so that we can understand how they are used.

**Compliance with law:**

In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal data.

If we do make such a transfer or if your personal information will be processed outside the European Economic Area, we will put a contract in place to ensure your information is protected or where applicable covered by the US 'Privacy Shield Program'. We may also use your information to help us to analyse use of the service and the Services and to improve the Services and their content or to troubleshoot problems and implement the Terms. Your personal data will only be processed by authorised staff members (or by such third parties as we may use from time to time to store and process data for us). 

* ### 8\. Deleting your information

You have the option to deactivate your profile at any time which will remove it from public view on our system.

We recommend you deactivate your profile if you are not using Tastebuds any more. If you change your mind in the future, you can return to your profile any time within two years and 'reactivate' your profile without losing any of your information.

If you would like to permanently delete your account please visit the Settings page of the site. Follow the links to Deactivate and then Permanently Delete your account under the 'Account' tab. Deletion will permanently remove your photos and profile information from our database. Support enquiries sent to us may be stored on file.

If your profile has been deleted because you have contravened our Terms of Use, we reserve the right to keep some or all of your personal data for up to 10 years from the date of deletion, in order to help protect other members, prevent fraud and to enable us to assist the Police or other law enforcement authorities if legally required to do so.

We keep your data for only as long as we need to. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for. For example, we may need it to use it to answer your queries about our services or where required by law. If you decide to take a break from Tastebuds and deactivate your profile, we will not show your profile on the Tastebuds services and you will not appear in anyone's search results or emails of suggested matches.

If you do not return to your Tastebuds profile within two years or if there is a lack of activity on your profile within those two years, we may decide to delete your personal data or make it anonymous by removing all your details.

If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing communications in future.

* ### 9\. Internal use of information

We may internally use your information to improve our services, analyse site usage, optimise content, etc. This will only be conducted by authorised staff members of Tastebuds.fm. We may use personally identifiable information to troubleshoot problems and implement our terms and conditions.

You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us.

Unfortunately, sending information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data once with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.
