        <p class="tk-Para">
            This website - <a href="https://www.tastekid.com/">https://www.tastekid.com/</a> - (the "Website") is owned and operated by TasteKid, Inc. ("TasteKid" or "We"). We understand and value your privacy. At TasteKid, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.
        </p>
        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">The Information TasteKid Collects</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            Information You Provide: You may provide to TasteKid what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, age, email address) if you use certain services or products from TasteKid or otherwise use the features and functionality of TasteKid.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            "Automatically Collected" Information: When you access TasteKid or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system, such as the Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, your preferences (musicians, movies, TV shows, books, authors, games that you liked or disliked) as saved on your TasteKid profile, the content and pages that you access on TasteKid, and the dates and times that you visit TasteKid.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            Facebook Information: when you connect with TasteKid using your Facebook account, TasteKid may retrieve additional taste-related information from your Facebook account, such as the bands or movies that you liked on Facebook. This is solely for the purpose of enhancing the quality of the recommendations and providing a more personalized experience (providing you with better recommendations).
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            "Cookies" Information: When you access TasteKid, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer.
            We use cookies to personalize content, to provide social media features, to analyse our traffic and to personalize ads. We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners.
            TasteKid may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to TasteKid in order to improve your experience. Persistent cookies can be removed.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            Your username: Your username is displayed throughout TasteKid and is therefore available to the public. Other people can see your likes, dislikes, associated comments, etc. Therefore, if you associate your actual name with your username, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your activities on TasteKid.
        </p>
        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">The Way TasteKid Uses Information</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            TasteKid uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the TasteKid website.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            We may use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major TasteKid updates, for customer service purposes, and to send privacy or security related notices. We may also use your email address to send weekly updates and other notifications related to your TasteKid activity (eg. if someone likes your profile). You can control which such emails to receive from your account settings (after logging in, go to: <a href="https://www.tastekid.com/account/settings">https://www.tastekid.com/account/settings</a> ) .
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            TasteKid uses some of the information that we collect to improve the way the TasteKid website works and looks, and to create new features and functionality. Taste-related information, such as the bands, musicians, authors/writers, movies, games, books and TV shows titles that you like or dislike on TasteKid, or bands, musicians, writers, movies, games, books and TV shows titles that you liked on Facebook, that we might retrieve, after your permission, as provided when you chose to connect to TasteKid using your Facebook account, may be used to improve the quality of the recommendations, and thus provide better suggestions, based on what you like.
        </p>
        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">When TasteKid Discloses Information</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            TasteKid does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of TasteKid - such as when you publish contact information to complete your profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.
        </p>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            TasteKid may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.
        </p>
        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            TasteKid uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to TasteKid, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, TasteKid makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
        </p>
        <h2 class="tk-Heading tk-Heading--2">Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p class="tk-Para">
            IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE TASTEKID PLATFORM AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, TasteKid does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If TasteKid learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the TasteKid Platform, then TasteKid will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
