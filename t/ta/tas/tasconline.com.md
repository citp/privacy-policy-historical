# Privacy

Total Administrative Services Corporation (TASC) takes your privacy very seriously. We share a commitment to protect your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information.

This Notice is provided to help you better understand how we at TASC obtain, use, share, and protect your non-public personal financial information. As a provider of services to you as a client , we often collect personal and sometimes sensitive information. Protecting the confidentiality of that information has been and will continue to be, a top priority at TASC. We believe that you should know about the information we collect, the measures we take to safeguard it, and the situations in which we might share information.

### Information We Collect

The information we collect and the extent to which we use it will vary depending on the service involved. We collect only the information necessary to consistently deliver responsive services to you as the client. Information we collect may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following: your name, address, phone number, social security number, age, sex, information regarding your assets and income, employment status, dependent information, and other information provided on plan applications and related forms . We also maintain information about your relationships with us, such as payment history and account balances.
