We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers or business partners on our Site, and can be used by such service providers or business partners to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.
