The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The Services do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s [privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

See the Opt-Out section (below) to learn about choices available to you with respect to this type of advertising. 

4.3 We may aggregate your information into a form where individuals can no longer be identified.

For example, we may freely share such information with third parties who may use such data for their own marketing, advertising, research, or other business purposes.

4.4 If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your information may be disclosed to third parties who help design, administer and implement the promotion, including in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment and aggregated data analysis. Your information also may be disclosed as required by law, such as on a winners list.

4.5 We may provide products or services jointly with or through certain third-party businesses, including but not limited to retail businesses. When we provide these products or services, we may give you the opportunity to opt-in to the additional sharing of information with these businesses. Should you choose to do so, information you provide specifically in connection with those products and services may be shared with these businesses and subject to their privacy policies.

4.6 The Services may allow users to post comments and other content to the Services. Any information about yourself that you post to the Services will become public information and will be accessible by other users of the Services.

You are not required to receive such messages as a condition of purchasing any property, goods or services. Registered users may choose not to receive text messages from us by not providing us their cell phone number. You can also cancel the SMS service at any time by replying ‘STOP’ via text. Please note that standard message rates and data charges from your cellular service provider apply to sending and/or receiving text messages. You are solely responsible for such message rates and data charges. 

4.9 We may disclose information about you if required to do so by law or on the good-faith believe that such sharing is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or our Services; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Services, or our users; or (c) act to protect the personal safety of our employees and agents, other users of the Services, or members of the public.

4.10 If we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or a financing, investment, support or funding, sharing or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be among the assets shared or transferred. We cannot promise that an acquiring party or the merged entity will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy.

### 5\. Your Security

5.1 We strive to keep your information private and safe. We take commercially reasonable physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the security of the information collected. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the transmission of data over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information, so please do not send us your credit card number by email. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. 

### 6\. Your Options

6.1 You may choose not to subscribe to email communications other than service-related communications such as payment confirmation. If you do choose to receive email communications such as email newsletters and promotional emails, you may later opt out by following the instructions provided at the bottom of each email, clicking the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of emails we sent you, or by managing your preferences here: <http://tasteofcountry.com/privacy/preferences>. Please allow up to ten (10) business days for changes to your email preferences to take effect. 

6.2 You can learn more about ad serving companies and the options available to limit their collection and use of your information by visiting the Services for the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/), and the [European Interactive Advertising Digital Alliance (EDAA)](https://www.edaa.eu/edaa-for-users/). Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device. For more information about how to change these settings go to:

The DAA’s AppChoices App provides options regarding the collection of cross-app data for your device.

Additional resources or tools may exist that streamline the process of submitting opt-out requests--for example, [TRUSTe’s Ad Preference Manager](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). We do not review or warrant the representations made by these tools and cannot guarantee the effectiveness. 

6.4 Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Services or on other Services, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms. If you delete your cookies, you may also delete your opt-out preferences. If you use multiple browsers or devices you may need to execute this opt out on each browser or device.

6.5 Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. At this time, we do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.

6.6 Registered users who have provided their cell phone number to us may remove it from within their personal profile settings. If you prefer not to receive text or wireless promotional communications on your mobile device, you can opt out by replying STOP.

6.7 You may update or delete information from your profile at any time, or request that we do so; however, because we archive past transactions, you cannot delete this information. You may also request that we delete your account entirely by contacting us. Terminating your registration will not necessarily remove previous public comments or other user content on public display on the Services. If you wish to cancel your account on the Services or delete your information previously provided to us, you may send your request here: <http://tasteofcountry.com/privacy/preferences>.

6.8 If you do not receive a response from us to any emails you send to us within ten (10) business days, please send us another email, as your original email may not have been received.
