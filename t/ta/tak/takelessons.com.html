  <h1>Service Scout Inc Privacy Policy</h1>

  Last revised: November 2008
    	

  <p>
  Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience with 
  Service Scout as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use all
  of Service Scout's services with complete confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
  We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to 
  privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how Service Scout collects
  information from all end users of Service Scout's services (the "Services") --
  those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors"), 
  as well as those who pay service fees to subscribe to the Services 
  ("Members"). It describes what we do with the information we collect, and 
  the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of 
  such information.
  </p>

  <p>
  Service Scout requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.
  </p>

  <h2>
  Personal Information Service Scout Collects and How It Is Used
  </h2>

  <h3>
  Introduction
  </h3>


  <p>
   Service Scout collects information in different ways from Visitors and
   Members who access the various parts of our Services. We use this 
   information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use 
   our Services, and generally do not share this information with third 
   parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if 
   we have received your permission beforehand or in very special 
   circumstances, such as when we believe that law requires such disclosure 
   or other special cases described below.
  </p>
    	

  <h3>
  Registration 
  </h3>


  <p>
  Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign 
  up for our Services including name, address, telephone number and billing 
  information (such as a credit card number and expiration date). The 
  personal information collected from Members during the registration process 
  is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). 
  This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically 
  stated otherwise or in special circumstances.
  </p>

  <p>
  However, in instances where Service Scout and a partner jointly promote the
  Services or new services, Service Scout may provide the partner certain
  personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons 
  who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the 
  sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the 
  promotion. In this instance, the partner may not use personal information 
  for any other purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
  Service Scout may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from
  personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total 
  number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, 
  we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell 
  advertisements that appear on the Services.
  </p>
   

  <h3>
  Your Credit Card Information is Secure
  </h3>
    	
  <p>
  We are committed to handling your customer information with high standards 
  of information security. Your credit card information is stored only in 
  encrypted form and processed using a secured order server with Secure Socket 
  Layer (SSL) technology. We restrict access to your personally identifiable 
  information only to employees with proper clearance who need to know that 
  information in order to provide products or services to you. While we make 
  every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, 
  we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party 
  "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you to prefer to place your order by telephone, you can call us during 
  normal business hours at 619-858-2200 with your credit card 
  and billing information.
  </p>
    	

  <h3>
  What is your Credit Card Fraud Policy?
  </h3>
    	

  <p>
  In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your credit 
  card, promptly report the fraudulent activity to your credit card company. 
  Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you are only liable for the first $50 
  of the fraudulent charges. Please check with your credit card company to 
  verify specific terms and conditions.
  </p>

  <h3>Communication to Members</h3>
  <p>
  Service Scout uses personal information to communicate important information with our Members. Important information includes, but not limited to, student newsletters, instructor newsletters, lesson reminders, lesson journal entries, payment information, credit card update notifications, and other important account information. Members agree to accept this communication from Service Scout.
  </p>
    	

  <h3>
  Service Scout Partners and Sponsors
  </h3>
    	

  <p>
  Some Service Scout products and services are offered to Visitors and Members
  in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and 
  Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to 
  collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will 
  be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may 
  decide not to use that particular service or feature. Service Scout may need
  to share non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described 
  above), but not personal information, with such partners in order to 
  administer the co-branded products or services offered.
  </p>
    	

  <h3>
  Online Advertisements
  </h3>
    	

  <p>
  Service Scout occasionally displays online advertisements on our website and in
  our newsletters and alerts. We share aggregated and non-identifying 
  information about our Visitors and Members collected through the 
  registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with 
  these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated 
  and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For 
  instance, an advertiser might tell us the audience they want to reach (for 
  example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provide us with an 
  advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the aggregated and 
  non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the 
  advertisement to the intended audience. However, Service Scout does not share
  personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers.
  </p>
    	

  <h3>
  Responses to Email Inquiries
  </h3>
    	

  <p>
  When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to Service Scout, we use the
  return email address to answer the email inquiry we receive. Service Scout
  does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not 
  share the return email address with any third party.
  </p>
    	

  <h3>
  Email Marketing From Third Party Sponsors
  </h3>
    	

  <p>
  In addition, from time to time, Service Scout sends, on behalf of third parties,
  promotions via mail to some or all of its subscribers. However, in no event 
  does Service Scout sell or otherwise transfer to third parties the email
  addresses of its subscribers. Service Scout strictly maintains the confidentiality
  of its subscribers' email addresses. In addition, users are always given the 
  opportunity of opting-out of these promotions.
  </p>
    	

  <h3>
  Voluntary Customer Surveys   
  </h3>
    	

  <p>
  We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. 
  We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they 
  provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types 
  of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal 
  information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if a 
  third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys 
  is voluntary.
  </p>
  <p>
  We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our 
  Customer Surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers 
  to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as 
  gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, 
  or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information 
  to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services 
  and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may 
  be shared with third parties.
  </p>
    	

  <h3>
  Special Cases  
  </h3>
    	

  <p>
  It is Service Scout's policy not to use or share personal information about
  Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without 
  also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such 
  unrelated uses. However, Service Scout may disclose personal information about
  Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or 
  Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole 
  discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to 
  satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 
  regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to 
  disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring 
  legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use Policy 
  or other policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect 
  Service Scout and our Members.
  </p>
    	

  <h3>
  "Cookies" and How Service Scout Uses Them
  </h3>
    	

  <p>
  A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive 
  when you visit certain Web sites. Service Scout may use cookies to collect,
  store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve 
  the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications 
  networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your settings 
  (which saves you time) and to provide customizable and personalized 
  services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your 
  customer information. Advertisers and partners may also use their own 
  cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies and expressly disclaim 
  responsibility for information collected through them.
  </p>
  	

  <h3>
  Service Scout's Commitment to Data Security
  </h3>
  	

  <p>
  Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to 
  protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our 
  control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security 
  of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures 
  will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this 
  information. 
  </p>
  	
    	

  <h3>
  In the Event of a Change in Ownership
  </h3>
    	

  <p>
  In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger or an acquisition of
  Service Scout by another entity, all (or select aspects) of Service Scout's customer
  information (including email addresses) may be transferred to this new 
  entity or owner. All Service Scout subscribers and registered users will be
  notified within five business days of any change in ownership, merger or 
  an acquisition of Service Scout's assets by a third party. Subscribers and users
  may choose to access and modify any of their registration and subscription 
  information at that time.
  </p>
