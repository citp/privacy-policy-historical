      <div class="static-content privacy-policy">
        <h2 class="text-center">Privacy Policy</h2>
      
        <p><em>Effective Date: July 20, 2018</em></p>
      
        <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Takl, Inc. and our affiliates and subsidiaries ("Takl" or "we" or "us" or "our") treats information collected or provided in connection with transactions, activities, and data gathered when a User ("you" or "User") visits or uses the Takl Platform. This Policy is incorporated by reference into the <a href="https://takl.com/terms-of-use"><u>Terms of&nbsp;Use</u></a><u>.</u> Any capitalized terms used and not defined in this Policy shall have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Use.</p>
        <p><strong>Please note that the use of the Takl Platform constitutes your acceptance of this Policy. If you do not agree with how we have determined to handle your information, please do not visit or use the Takl Platform. The Takl Platform is only intended for use in the United States and the personal information you provide us as a user will be stored in the United States. </strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>1. Effective Date and Changes</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>This Policy applies to all information collected by or provided to us on or after the Effective Date. Takl will periodically review and revise this Policy as Takl modifies the Platform and will update the Effective Date above upon any such changes. We will treat your continued use of the Takl Platform following such changes as your acceptance of them. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy.</p>
        <p>If our practices change regarding previously collected Personal Information in a way that would be materially less restrictive than those policies in effect at the time we collected the information, we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice and to obtain consent to any such uses as may be required by law, but we will not be liable for any failure to do so.</p>
        <ol start="2">
        <li><strong>2. Personal Information Collected on the Takl Platform</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Because we respect your rights to your own privacy, we are committed to our policies established for the collection and/or use of your “Personal Information,” which is hereby defined as “full name, username, postal address, phone number, email address, age, birth date, and any information that could be used to identify, contact, or locate you directly without using the Takl Platform.”</p>
        <p>For the purposes of this Policy, Personal Information does not include your photograph or other image. Takl has determined to establish separate policies specifically governing the use of photographs for and on the Takl Platform in Section 5 herein and further in “Photographs” provision of our Terms of Use.</p>
        <p>By using the Takl Platform, you are authorizing us to collect, parse, and retain data related to the provision of the Takl Platform. However, we also provide Users with options and choices regarding how we use and disclose some or all of your Personal Information, as set forth specifically below, including how to access, correct, and/or remove it. You may avoid further said data collection by uninstalling the App from your mobile device and not otherwise using the Takl Platform.</p>
        <p>When you visit or use the Takl Platform, we collect information about you in the following general categories.</p>
        <ul class="indented-list indented-list--spaced">
        <li><u>Location Information</u>:&nbsp;We collect precise location data through the App when it is used by Providers if the Providers' devices permit such information collection. We may collect this information when Providers use certain functionality, such as navigating to a location to provide the Services, and we may also collect the precise location of a Provider’s device when the App is running in the foreground or background. We may derive a Provider’s approximate location from the Provider’s IP address.&nbsp;The Takl Platform utilizes geo-location features to match Customers to Providers, to update Customers on the status of Providers en route to perform Services, to confirm that a Provider performed Services, and to improve the services on the Takl Platform.</li>
        <p>We also may use and disclose geo-location we collect through the Takl Platform for other business purposes, including for legal purposes (such as to enforce our agreements) and in the event of a proposed or actual merger, sale, or other business asset transfers. The geo-location information obtained about a User will be retained in an identifiable manner, along with geo-location data about job sites where Providers performed Services on initial and/or follow-up jobs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><u>Transaction Information</u>:&nbsp;We collect transaction details related to your use of the Takl Platform, such as type of service requested, date and time of service, amount charged, distance traveled, intra-User communications, ratings and reviews, and other related transaction details.&nbsp;</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><u>Provider Registration and Payment</u>:&nbsp;To register as a Provider, you may need to provide other Personal Information, including your social security number, bank account and a U.S. government-issued I.D., and in some jurisdictions we may collect additional business or contractor licenses. We share certain information with our partners who help us by running background checks on Providers to help protect the Takl community. We may use report information we receive from background check service providers for the purposes of assessing whether to permit an individual to use the Takl Platform as a Provider and to comply with applicable law. To make sure Providers get paid, we keep information about Provider’s bank routing numbers, tax information, and any other payment information provided by Providers. To keep your data secure, we do not store your full bank account information or social security number on our servers.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><u>Takl Payment Method</u>: When you add a credit card or payment method to your Takl account, a third party that handles payments for us will receive your card information. To keep your financial data secure, we do not store full credit card information on our servers.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><u>Customer Support</u>:&nbsp;We may collect Personal Information through your communications with our customer-support team.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><u>Usage and Preference Information</u>:&nbsp;We collect information that is generated automatically about how you and visitors interact with the Takl Platform, preferences expressed, and settings chosen.&nbsp;When we associate such information with specific personal information, we will treat the combination as Personal Information, as set forth herein.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><u>Communications Between Users</u>:&nbsp;As an enhanced privacy feature, we use a third-party service called Twilio to mask the telephone numbers used during calls or texts (SMS) between Users (See additional provisions regarding Twilio herein below). We do not reveal telephone numbers submitted on file, although we store any call data, including associated date, time, and content.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><u>Device Information</u>:&nbsp;We may collect information about your mobile device, including the following examples: the hardware model, operating system/version, software names/versions, file names/versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><u>Log Information</u>:&nbsp;When you interact with the Takl Platform, we collect server logs, which may include device IP addresses, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, browser type, and the third-party site/service accessed immediately prior to interacting with the Takl Platform.</li>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <li><u>Third-Party Site Account Access</u>: If you log in to the Takl Platform through a social networking site, such as Google or Facebook, we may collect your authentication token, registration information, and account identification number and use that information to provide you with access to your account on the Takl Platform.</li>
      </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol start="3">
        <li><strong>3. Use of Information</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>We only use your Personal Information for Takl-Platform related purposes. (This includes the information collected by our third-party service providers, set forth herein; however, this does not include our use of photographs, which is governed separately).</p>
        <p>Specifically, the purposes of our “use” include platform-analytics, marketing, advertising, and other purposes designed to help us efficiently operate and improve the Takl Platform in the following manner:</p>
        <ul class="indented-list indented-list--spaced">
        <li>to contact you in connection with your Takl-related activities (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, account verification text messages, push notification alerts, or important alerts that could affect your relationship with Takl),</li>
        <li>for identification and authentication,</li>
        <li>for security and fraud prevention,</li>
        <li>to perform background checks,</li>
        <li>to investigate potential unauthorized use of your information by a Provider,</li>
        <li>to communicate Service requests from you to other Users, and/or</li>
        <li>to suggest potential Customers for your Services.</li>

        <li><strong>5. Use of Your Profile Pictures and Other Job-related Pictures</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Unless we expressly obtain your individual permission, Takl will only use your Photos specifically for Takl-platform related purposes, such as showing job-related pictures as well as marketing, advertising, and other related purposes. Takl enables Users to post job-related pictures, including “before” and “after” job pictures, to third-party websites and apps. Takl will not share your Photos with other third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>When you use the Takl Platform, our third-party partners, such as ad networks and analytics providers, use tracking technologies to collect information about how the Takl Platform is used and about the devices used to access the Takl Platform. Our partners also may collect information about your online activities over time and on other websites or apps. When our third-party partners provide such features, they are governed by the privacy policies of their governing organizations. You may be able to change browser or app settings to block and delete these technologies when you access the Takl Platform, but that might interfere with the Takl Platform’s proper functioning.</p>
