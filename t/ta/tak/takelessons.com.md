# Privacy Policy | Music Lessons | TakeLessons

Last revised: November 2008 

Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience with Service Scout as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use all of Service Scout's services with complete confidence. 

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how Service Scout collects information from all end users of Service Scout's services (the "Services") -- those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors"), as well as those who pay service fees to subscribe to the Services ("Members"). It describes what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. 

Service Scout requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. 

##  Personal Information Service Scout Collects and How It Is Used 

###  Introduction 

Service Scout collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services, and generally do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that law requires such disclosure or other special cases described below. 

###  Registration 

Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number and billing information (such as a credit card number and expiration date). The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. 

However, in instances where Service Scout and a partner jointly promote the Services or new services, Service Scout may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, the partner may not use personal information for any other purpose. 

Service Scout may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. 

###  Your Credit Card Information is Secure 

We are committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security. Your credit card information is stored only in encrypted form and processed using a secured order server with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We restrict access to your personally identifiable information only to employees with proper clearance who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. 

If you to prefer to place your order by telephone, you can call us during normal business hours at 619-858-2200 with your credit card and billing information. 

###  What is your Credit Card Fraud Policy? 

In the unlikely event that you experience unauthorized use of your credit card, promptly report the fraudulent activity to your credit card company. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you are only liable for the first $50 of the fraudulent charges. Please check with your credit card company to verify specific terms and conditions. 

### Communication to Members

Service Scout uses personal information to communicate important information with our Members. Important information includes, but not limited to, student newsletters, instructor newsletters, lesson reminders, lesson journal entries, payment information, credit card update notifications, and other important account information. Members agree to accept this communication from Service Scout. 

###  Service Scout Partners and Sponsors 

Some Service Scout products and services are offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, you will be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or feature. Service Scout may need to share non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not personal information, with such partners in order to administer the co-branded products or services offered. 

###  Online Advertisements 

Service Scout occasionally displays online advertisements on our website and in our newsletters and alerts. We share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. For instance, an advertiser might tell us the audience they want to reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provide us with an advertisement tailored to that audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. However, Service Scout does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers. 

###  Responses to Email Inquiries 

When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to Service Scout, we use the return email address to answer the email inquiry we receive. Service Scout does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party. 

###  Email Marketing From Third Party Sponsors 

In addition, from time to time, Service Scout sends, on behalf of third parties, promotions via mail to some or all of its subscribers. However, in no event does Service Scout sell or otherwise transfer to third parties the email addresses of its subscribers. Service Scout strictly maintains the confidentiality of its subscribers' email addresses. In addition, users are always given the opportunity of opting-out of these promotions. 

###  Voluntary Customer Surveys 

We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. 

We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties. 

###  Special Cases 

It is Service Scout's policy not to use or share personal information about Visitors or Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. However, Service Scout may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use Policy or other policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect Service Scout and our Members. 

###  "Cookies" and How Service Scout Uses Them 

A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. Service Scout may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member, we will use a cookie to save your settings (which saves you time) and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control the use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. 

###  Service Scout's Commitment to Data Security 

Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information. 

###  In the Event of a Change in Ownership 

In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger or an acquisition of Service Scout by another entity, all (or select aspects) of Service Scout's customer information (including email addresses) may be transferred to this new entity or owner. All Service Scout subscribers and registered users will be notified within five business days of any change in ownership, merger or an acquisition of Service Scout's assets by a third party. Subscribers and users may choose to access and modify any of their registration and subscription information at that time.
