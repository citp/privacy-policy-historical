Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:**  This Privacy Policy was last revised on June 17, 2016 **.**

**TakePart Privacy Policy**

TakePart, LLC—a digital news and lifestyle magazine and social action platform for the conscious consumer—is a division of [_Participant Media_](http://www.participantmedia.com/) the company behind Pivot Television Network and such important films as _Lincoln_ , _Contagion_ , _The Help_ , _The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel_ , _Food, Inc_., _Waiting For “Superman_ , _”_ _CITIZENFOUR_ and _An Inconvenient Truth_.  TakePart’s audience are socially conscious citizens who come together to learn about important issues through TakePart’s content and to take action via TakePart’s online platform by signing petitions, making donations, sharing articles and videos and more.

The privacy of each and every user matters deeply to us, and we strive for transparency in all of our data privacy practices, especially when it comes to identifying the information we collect, use, share, and disclose, as well as the ways we help keep your information safe.  Unless we have obtained your permission or otherwise disclosed it in this Privacy Policy, TakePart does not sell your personal information for our own financial gain, nor will we share your personal information with third parties for direct marketing to you without first offering you an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. We take our responsibility to protect your information very seriously.  Please remember, [_we are always here to answer any questions you have_](https://web.archive.org/contact-us), and we look forward to serving you for years to come.

Our Services are not directed towards individuals under the age of 13 and are not meant to be used or accessed by individuals under the age of 13.  We do not knowingly collect personal information, including phone numbers, addresses, and names, from users under the age of 13, and we will readily delete such information should this occur.  If you believe we might have any information from or about an individual under the age of 13, please contact us via our [_Contact Us_](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) page.

**_Take Part Services_**

TakePart, LLC (also referred to as “TakePart,” “we,” “our,” and “us” throughout this document) allows consumers to view content, take action, communicate with one another and exchange ideas on our website, takepart.com (the “Site”).  We also offer users the opportunity to take action through various TakePart Action Widgets, which may be available on other platforms besides the Site.  These TakePart Action Widgets, together with the Site, may be referred to as the “Service” or “Services” throughout this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy covers all the Services that TakePart offers, and it is our intention to provide you with a full description of how we collect, use, share, and disclose your information.

**_Your Acceptance of this Privacy Policy_**

To start, it is important for you to know that you accept the terms and details outlined in this Privacy Policy by continuing to use TakePart or any of our Services.  By interacting with our products and offerings, you are also accepting the [_Terms of Service_](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service).

**_Collection of Information_**

TakePart collects information from users in two ways.

First, we may collect names, email addresses, home addresses, telephone numbers, and any other such personal information that may be used to identify you as an individual.  This type of data is often referred to as PII (personally identifiable information), and is most commonly collected when you take action with us.  We only collect PII from you when you use certain TakePart Services.  For example, if you sign up for a newsletter, complete an action (such as a petition), or submit a customer service form, we may collect your name, address, telephone number, email, or other PII.

The other type of information we collect is more generic in nature and tells us about your online habits and preferences, like when you browse our Site.  These collection processes can also be used to help us offer a more entertaining and engaging experience.  This type of information doesn’t tell us who you are exactly, but it can tell us things like the pages you’ve viewed, how long you spend on our Site, what links you’ve clicked on, the time in which you view content, and where you are located.  This type of information is sometimes referred to as non-PII (non-personally identifiable information).  The type of non-PII we may collect from you includes information about what you look at on our Site, when you visit our Site, what advertisements you respond to, the types of devices you use (computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.), your IP address, links you follow from other websites, and content you engage with.  This type of information is sometimes combined to form aggregate data, which helps us summarize and analyze our customers’ experiences.  We also allow this type of information to be collected by ad networks.  An ad network is a company that connects advertisers to websites for the purpose of hosting advertisements.  We also employ the use of analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, that may gather this same type of information.  Aggregate data like this will not identify you individually and cannot be used to pinpoint any one specific person.

**_Use of Information_**

We may use the information we collect about you for a variety of reasons, including providing and improving our Services, offering you a more personalized experience, contacting you about your account and our Services, or to provide you with customer support.

**_Sharing of Information_**

The PII we collect through your use of our Service may be shared with vendors who we may work with for reasons such as to provide these Services to you or to maintain our Site.

We may also share your data with our Social Action Network (SAN), a group of over 100 nonprofits we work with in support of certain issues and causes.  In many cases, the things you look at and engage with on our website may be associated with, made possible, or supported by these SAN members.  However, we will not share your personal information with anyone for direct marketing purposes without offering you an opportunity to first opt-out of such sharing. 

Below is an example of what an optional opportunity to share your PII with a non-profit member may look like on TakePart.com.  You will see that you  have the opportunity to opt-out of having us share your personal data with the non-profit member by unchecking the box:

The non-PII information we gather about your interests and habits may also be shared as aggregate data (summarized information) or used by vendors for transactional or fulfillment purposes, such as to continue offering you relevant online services and improving our offerings.

**_Disclosure of Information_**

There may be times when we access or release your personal or general data to protect the legal rights or property of TakePart and its affiliates.  We might also use this information to protect the safety, security, and privacy of our users or members of the general public, especially in urgent situations.  Furthermore, we will use this information to protect against fraud and to comply with all U.S. laws and legal processes and rulings.

In addition, it is possible that we may transfer your information to another organization should we sell all or part of our business (or sell or transfer all or part of our assets).  During this process, your information would only be transferred to the party or parties involved in this transaction.

**_Social Networks and Sharing Features_**

Our Service offers social sharing features and other integrated tools.  These tools are created by other sites like Facebook (such as the Facebook Share button).  When you use these features or share any general or personal information through the use of these sites, you are bound by the privacy policies of these other services.  For example, if your post content from our website through a link on Facebook, you are then bound to Facebook’s privacy policies and terms of service.

**_Take Action_**

The Take Action portion of the Service (available via takeaction.takepart.com or through a TakePart Action Widget on TakePart.com and other sites) offers users the ability to ‘Take Action’—for example, sign a petition, take a pledge, make a donation, share a story, provide a message of support—all of which are aimed to drive positive social change.  We will collect information from you if you choose to participate in this portion of our Service.  Depending on the action you choose to take, we will ask you for specific personal information and/or more general information related to your preferences and experiences.  This may include contact information, email addresses, names, interests, feedback, etc.  The information you provide, including the content you post on our website, may be read, collected, distributed to, and used by others.  SAN members, recipient elected officials, government agencies, and/or other advocacy organizations may be among those who use or view this type of information as part of the fulfillment of the action.  Please think carefully when posting content through this Service and remember that the information you disclose may be viewed or given to others.

Note that if you choose to take an action that requires a signature, you will be given the ability to check a box that reads “Display My Signature.”  If you choose not to display your signature, it will not appear on the Site, but will still be shared with SAN members and other third parties as part of the fulfillment of the action.  If you do not want your signature collected, please do not take any action requiring your signature.  We are unable to remove the record of your signature once this action is completed.

If you would like to remove one of your posts, or want to learn more about this portion of the Service, please contact us via our [_Contact Us page_](https://web.archive.org/contact-us).

**_Cookies and Beacons_**

When you visit or interact with our Services, we may use cookies and web beacons to store certain pieces of information about your visit and interactions with our Service.  Your browser may allow you to remove or disable these cookies or web beacons.  However, if you do so, your experience on our Service will be affected, which means you may not be able to take advantage of certain features.  Further, third parties may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies in connection with our Service, which may include the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites and other online services.  We may also allow certain third parties, such as vendors, service providers and advertisers, to use the aggregate data obtained from cookies and web beacons.  Third-party use of this data is governed by their individual privacy policies.

**_Analytics Service Providers_**

We allow analytics companies to collect information about our users' computers or mobile devices and their online activities.  They do this using certain technologies that analyze this information.  We allow this to better deliver and improve our Services.  Analytics companies may use mobile device IDs, as described in the paragraph below (Mobile device IDs).  Unlike cookies, Mobile device IDs cannot be deleted.

If you want to learn more about the analytics services that we utilize, please contact us via our Contact Us page and select “Privacy” from the Topic pulldown menu.

**_Ad Networks and Advertisements_**

We allow ad networks to advertise on our website.  We may provide these ad networks with information about your interests and engagement with advertisements in order to help them customize ads on our sites and other sites you may visit.  This means that advertisements may be better suited to your specific interests and tailored to your preferences.  We do not provide any information that personally identifies you as an individual to any ad networks or advertisers.

To obtain a list of the ad network companies we work with and request their privacy policy information, please contact us via our Contact Us page.  Further, you may visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about this type of advertising and how to opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) self-regulatory program.  Note that electing to opt-out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications, although it may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or erase cookies from your browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

**_Links_**

The Service may contain links to other websites or web pages not operated by us.  TakePart may also display advertisements from third-party companies not associated with TakePart.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites and advertising companies, nor are we responsible for the privacy policies of other web pages and services operated by organizations and persons outside of TakePart (even when we provide links on our Service and include them within our content).  Once you leave the Service via such a link, access a third-party application (such as widgets), or click on an advertisement, you are then governed by these outside privacy policies.  This means that you must follow and accept their terms of service and individual privacy policies.

**_Managing, Updating or Canceling Your Account_**

You may change or update your personal data and account information by signing in and accessing Account Settings within your user profile.  You may also close your account on the Account Settings page.  If you wish to cancel or modify the email marketing communications you receive from us, you may do so by following the instructions contained within our promotional e-mails or by using the Contact Us page.

**_California Privacy Rights_**

If you are a minor and also a registered and current user of our Service, you have the right under California law to request that we remove any information that may identify you personally.  You may also request that we make this information appear anonymous so that it cannot be traced back to you.  We will comply with these requests unless we are required to maintain your information under applicable state and federal laws.  If you would like us to remove your personal information, please contact us via our Contact Us page and selecting “Request to remove information for a user believed to be under 13” from the Topic pulldown menu along with the details of your request.  Although we will try our best to remove the data you request, please note that the removal process does not ensure that everything will be completely deleted, especially once this content has been reposted or used on other websites.  Remember to think carefully before posting content on our website, as it can be difficult to remove completely.

We do not share any PII we collect from our users, including minors, for the third parties’ marketing purposes without first obtaining your consent or offering you an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing.

While you may have set your browser to Do Not Track (DNT), our technology will not respond to that setting at this time.

**_International Users Outside the United States_**

The Service is operated in the United States, and all of the data is stored in the United States.  As a user of the Service, you agree to the information outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, as well as the relevant United States laws that govern these documents.

By accessing or using our Service, or otherwise providing information to us, you give us permission to process or transfer any information that identifies you personally, as well as your aggregate data (summarized information) and details about your online habits, preferences, and experiences into the United States.

**_Security_**

We implement commercially reasonable physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your personal information.  However, we cannot and do not guarantee that your personal information will never be breached or viewed by someone other than TakePart. 

**_Changes to this Privacy Policy_**

From time-to-time, we may modify this Privacy Policy.  By continuing to use the Service after we post a revised Privacy Policy, you are accepting the terms outlined in the new Privacy Policy.  Therefore, it is important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated about any changes.
