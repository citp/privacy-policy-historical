# Takl | Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

_Effective Date: July 20, 2018_

This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how Takl, Inc. and our affiliates and subsidiaries ("Takl" or "we" or "us" or "our") treats information collected or provided in connection with transactions, activities, and data gathered when a User ("you" or "User") visits or uses the Takl Platform. This Policy is incorporated by reference into the [_Terms of  Use_](https://takl.com/terms-of-use) _._ Any capitalized terms used and not defined in this Policy shall have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Use.

**Please note that the use of the Takl Platform constitutes your acceptance of this Policy. If you do not agree with how we have determined to handle your information, please do not visit or use the Takl Platform. The Takl Platform is only intended for use in the United States and the personal information you provide us as a user will be stored in the United States.**

  1. **1\. Effective Date and Changes**



This Policy applies to all information collected by or provided to us on or after the Effective Date. Takl will periodically review and revise this Policy as Takl modifies the Platform and will update the Effective Date above upon any such changes. We will treat your continued use of the Takl Platform following such changes as your acceptance of them. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy.

If our practices change regarding previously collected Personal Information in a way that would be materially less restrictive than those policies in effect at the time we collected the information, we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice and to obtain consent to any such uses as may be required by law, but we will not be liable for any failure to do so.

  2. **2\. Personal Information Collected on the Takl Platform**



Because we respect your rights to your own privacy, we are committed to our policies established for the collection and/or use of your “Personal Information,” which is hereby defined as “full name, username, postal address, phone number, email address, age, birth date, and any information that could be used to identify, contact, or locate you directly without using the Takl Platform.”

For the purposes of this Policy, Personal Information does not include your photograph or other image. Takl has determined to establish separate policies specifically governing the use of photographs for and on the Takl Platform in Section 5 herein and further in “Photographs” provision of our Terms of Use.

By using the Takl Platform, you are authorizing us to collect, parse, and retain data related to the provision of the Takl Platform. However, we also provide Users with options and choices regarding how we use and disclose some or all of your Personal Information, as set forth specifically below, including how to access, correct, and/or remove it. You may avoid further said data collection by uninstalling the App from your mobile device and not otherwise using the Takl Platform.

When you visit or use the Takl Platform, we collect information about you in the following general categories.

  * _Location Information_ : We collect precise location data through the App when it is used by Providers if the Providers' devices permit such information collection. We may collect this information when Providers use certain functionality, such as navigating to a location to provide the Services, and we may also collect the precise location of a Provider’s device when the App is running in the foreground or background. We may derive a Provider’s approximate location from the Provider’s IP address. The Takl Platform utilizes geo-location features to match Customers to Providers, to update Customers on the status of Providers en route to perform Services, to confirm that a Provider performed Services, and to improve the services on the Takl Platform.

We also may use and disclose geo-location we collect through the Takl Platform for other business purposes, including for legal purposes (such as to enforce our agreements) and in the event of a proposed or actual merger, sale, or other business asset transfers. The geo-location information obtained about a User will be retained in an identifiable manner, along with geo-location data about job sites where Providers performed Services on initial and/or follow-up jobs.

  * _Transaction Information_ : We collect transaction details related to your use of the Takl Platform, such as type of service requested, date and time of service, amount charged, distance traveled, intra-User communications, ratings and reviews, and other related transaction details. 
  * _Provider Registration and Payment_ : To register as a Provider, you may need to provide other Personal Information, including your social security number, bank account and a U.S. government-issued I.D., and in some jurisdictions we may collect additional business or contractor licenses. We share certain information with our partners who help us by running background checks on Providers to help protect the Takl community. We may use report information we receive from background check service providers for the purposes of assessing whether to permit an individual to use the Takl Platform as a Provider and to comply with applicable law. To make sure Providers get paid, we keep information about Provider’s bank routing numbers, tax information, and any other payment information provided by Providers. To keep your data secure, we do not store your full bank account information or social security number on our servers.
  * _Takl Payment Method_ : When you add a credit card or payment method to your Takl account, a third party that handles payments for us will receive your card information. To keep your financial data secure, we do not store full credit card information on our servers.
  * _Customer Support_ : We may collect Personal Information through your communications with our customer-support team.
  * _Usage and Preference Information_ : We collect information that is generated automatically about how you and visitors interact with the Takl Platform, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. When we associate such information with specific personal information, we will treat the combination as Personal Information, as set forth herein.
  * _Communications Between Users_ : As an enhanced privacy feature, we use a third-party service called Twilio to mask the telephone numbers used during calls or texts (SMS) between Users (See additional provisions regarding Twilio herein below). We do not reveal telephone numbers submitted on file, although we store any call data, including associated date, time, and content.
  * _Device Information_ : We may collect information about your mobile device, including the following examples: the hardware model, operating system/version, software names/versions, file names/versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.
  * _Log Information_ : When you interact with the Takl Platform, we collect server logs, which may include device IP addresses, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, browser type, and the third-party site/service accessed immediately prior to interacting with the Takl Platform.
  * _Third-Party Site Account Access_ : If you log in to the Takl Platform through a social networking site, such as Google or Facebook, we may collect your authentication token, registration information, and account identification number and use that information to provide you with access to your account on the Takl Platform.

Like most online services and mobile applications, we and our third-party service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your activity from the computer or devices you use to access the Takl Platform. A cookie is a file saved on a user’s hard drive that stores certain information about user activity. Users must agree to let cookies be saved for them, and most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. Although you can modify your browser/device settings to reject cookies if desired, this could potentially affect the availability and functionality of our services.

Any third party with whom we are allowed to share your Personal Information is authorized to use your Personal Information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control. You agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions.

  10. **10\. Children's Information**



We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13, as the Takl Platform is not directed at Users under 18.

Your Takl profile is password-protected so that only you and authorized Takl employees have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Takl staff will never proactively reach out to you and ask for any personal account information, including your password. If you share a computer or mobile device, in order to protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties, you should sign out of your Takl account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. Takl has security measures in place intended to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.

_International_. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside; and the privacy laws governing the country/jurisdiction of these computer networks may be less protective.

Takl takes steps to ensure that your information is secure on its system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Takl cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
