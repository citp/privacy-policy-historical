TACODA's Privacy Policy

_Last updated January 19, 2006_

TACODA Systems, Inc. ("TACODA") is a provider of targeted marketing technology and services to websites and online marketers, and considers the protection of your privacy to be of paramount importance. We operate two distinct services, TACODA _Audience Management Services_ ™, an advertising targeting service for websites, and TACODA _Audience Networks_ ™, an advertising network service for marketers and affiliated websites. This Privacy Policy was prepared to describe how we use and collect consumer data in providing these services.

**TACODA as a technology provider - TACODA Audience Management Services**

TACODA _Audience Management Services_ (AMS) help websites collect consumer information and target advertisements on their websites or groups of websites. The information TACODA processes on such websites' behalf belongs to those websites and is not further used by TACODA.

**TACODA as an advertising network - TACODA Audience Networks**

TACODA _Audience Networks_ (or the "network") is a collection of first tier websites that have joined in an effort to improve ad delivery while maintaining stringent standards on the usage of user data. The network matches ads to visitors' network browsing behavior; however, TACODA _Audience Networks_ does not own or share any visitor data.

**Data Collection and Usage**

  * Personal Information 



Personal information is data about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, that is not otherwise publicly available. As part of AMS, TACODA may collect, host and manage the personal information that our website partners have chosen to collect from their sites. This data is the property of our website partners and is subject to their respective privacy policies. TACODA may not use this data in any way that is not authorized and requested by the websites from whose sites the data originated.

TACODA _Audience Networks_ never uses, collects or keeps personal information about people who interact with any of the sites in the network. 

  * Non-Personal Information 



When you are on one of the websites (using TACODA products and services), the website, using cookies (see below), collects certain non-personal information from you, including but not limited to your browser type (for example, Internet Explorer or Mozilla) and your operating system (for example, Windows or Macintosh). In addition, the sites in the network collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the websites, the content areas or pages of the websites that you visit (for example, 'sports section' or 'technology section'), the ads that were on pages you visited, and other click-stream data, none of which will include personal information about you.

  * Registration Data 



Some of the websites collect additional information about you through registration, for activities such as access to premium content, entering sweepstakes, or for fulfilling offers like email newsletter subscriptions. This information sometimes includes personal information such as your address or phone number, and non-personal demographic information such as age, gender and zip code. To refine the targeting of ads that are most appropriate for you, AMS and TACODA _Audience Networks_ may access the non-personal information that may have been collected in a registration environment. Personal information such as name, address and phone number is never accessed.

  * Customer Information 



Prospective customers (websites and online marketers) can go to the [www.tacoda.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060430212319id_/http%3A//www.tacoda.net/index.html) site and provide their contact information to find out more and to be contacted by a TACODA representative. TACODA or its service providers reserve the right to use this information for business purposes such as marketing and research. TACODA and its service providers are prohibited from using this information for other purposes or from sharing this information with other companies. This information is not used for purposes other than responding to the request.

**Temporary Use and Disbursement of Non-Personal Information**

In order to serve visitors appropriate ads, TACODA _Audience Networks_ will temporarily assemble non-personal, demographic, behavioral and technical information to create very large audience segments. These segments represent data that has been aggregated into large anonymous groupings. After the ad or ads have been served, only aggregate segment level data is retained by TACODA _Audience Networks_.

TACODA _Audience Networks_ does not provide any personal information to marketers when you interact with or view a targeted ad.

To make certain that ads served by TACODA _Audience Networks_ are targeted correctly, partner websites in the network place TACODA _Audience Networks_ data tags on their sites. These tags are not personally identifiable nor do they collect personal information. They are used to match visitor browsing behavior to a segment profile designated for targeting ads to visitors. 

**Cookies**

Nearly all websites, including those using AMS and in TACODA _Audience Networks_ , use a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer. The site placing the packet on your computer can then recognize the computer when you revisit the site. The site's computer uses the cookie to provide services such as auto log on and relevant ad delivery, and to better understand how you are interacting with the site. These cookies effectively enable sites to better customize the site to your needs and interests, so that it can be as valuable to you as possible.

You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to use certain features on the websites or take full advantage of all the website offerings and targeted advertising. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the 'Help' menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

Alternatively, you may [click here to opt-out of data collection and targeting cookies from TACODA _Audience Networks_](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp). Be advised that if you change computers or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser. 

**Privacy Compliance**

TACODA is a member of the [**Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)**](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) and is in compliance with the NAI's Self-Regulatory Principles which have been developed in collaboration with the Federal Trade Commission.
