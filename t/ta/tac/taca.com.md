# Security and privacy - TACA.COM

  | 

We have gone to great lengths to build a secure Web site in which our customers can book their flights quickly and easily without worrying about their personal information being divulged to unauthorized parties. Among the measures we have incorporated are data encryption, automatic sign-off, and firewalls. All information entered in the interactive parts of the site is maintained strictly confidential and will not be sold or otherwise shared with any other company or person. For the additional protection of our customers, we do not retain credit card data on our servers.

DISTANCIA  members can review their account statements online by entering a PIN  . This security measure exists to prevent unauthorized access to personal accounts.

If you forget your PIN, notify us and we will send a copy to the e-mail address registered for your account.

  * The information we collect is limited to two types: That necessary for our customers to purchase online (name, address, phone, etc.)
  * Information that helps us to offer products designed to meet specific requirements and preferences of our customers, such as travel preferences (seat assignments, class of  service, special meals) and preferred destinations.



In both cases, we are committed to protecting our customers' right to privacy, and to remaining at the forefront of advances in online security measures. Additional information is available from VeriSign Security Systems®
