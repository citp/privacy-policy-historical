    		<h2>What information does Taco Bell collect about me on this Site?</h2>
    		<p>Taco Bell collects personally identifiable information that you may voluntarily provide on online forms, which may include: user registration, sweepstakes registration, contact requests, guest comments, send-a-friend features, online surveys, application or other file download pages, and other online and mobile activities.

			<p>In addition to the Personal Information that you provide, as identified above, our Site may use technologies such as “cookies” to collect certain information and to provide visitors with tailored information upon each visit. Cookies are a common part of many commercial websites that allow small text files to be sent by a website, accepted by a web browser and then placed on your hard drive as recognition for repeat visits to the Site.

You do not need to enable cookies to visit our Site; however, some parts of the Site and some services may be more difficult or impossible to use if cookies are disabled. Taco Bell also uses cookies on the Site to identify an index key with Our e-cards (online postcards).  Our web servers may also automatically identify computers by their IP addresses.
