If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should immediately cease the use of this Site.</p>

<h2>What information does Taco Bell collect about me on this Site?</h2>

<p>Taco Bell collects personally identifiable information that you may voluntarily provide on online forms, which may include: user registration, sweepstakes registration, contact requests, guest comments, send-a-friend features, online surveys, application or other file download pages, and other online and mobile activities. The personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) collected on this Site can include some or all of the following: your name, address, telephone number, e-mail addresses, credit card information, demographic information, and other information you may voluntarily provide or which may be collected as described herein. We will indicate at the time of collection when you have the choice whether or not to disclose Personal Information; however, some parts of the Site and some services may not be available, or may be more difficult to use if you choose not to disclose or have Personal Information shared. From time to time we may give you the option to receive future offers and updates. If you choose to opt-in, we will alert you to new features, special offers, updated information and new services.</p>

<p>In addition to the Personal Information that you provide, as identified above, our Site may use technologies such as “cookies” to collect certain information and to provide visitors with tailored information upon each visit. Cookies are a common part of many commercial websites that allow small text files to be sent by a website, accepted by a web browser and then placed on your hard drive as recognition for repeat visits to the Site. Every time you visit our Site, our servers, through cookies, pixels and/or GIF files, collect basic technical information such as your domain name, the address of the last URL visited prior to clicking through to the Site, and your browser and operating system. You do not need to enable cookies to visit our Site; however, some parts of the Site and some services may be more difficult or impossible to use if cookies are disabled. Taco Bell also uses cookies on the Site to identify an index key with Our e-cards (online postcards). Our web servers may also automatically identify computers by their IP addresses. Taco Bell may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

<h2>What does Taco Bell do with the information collected?</h2>

Yum Brands includes: KFC U.S. Properties, Inc., Taco Bell Corp., Pizza Hut, Inc., Long John Silver’s, Inc., A&amp;W Restaurants, Inc., WingStreet, LLC, and Yum Restaurants International, Inc. Taco Bell may share Personal Information collected on this Site with any member of Yum Brands and any other future subsidiaries or affiliates. Taco Bell may share Personal Information with third parties under the following circumstances: (i) in connection with a court order, subpoena, government investigation, or when otherwise required by law; (ii) in the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition, or similar event; or (iii) when working with third party companies to support the Site’s technical operation or execute a specific promotion or program (such as providing responses to the Guest Comments Page, conduct surveys, maintain a database of visitor information, offer downloadable applications for mobile devices, etc.). If Personal Information is shared with any third party for the purposes of executing a specific promotion or program, it is Taco Bell's policy to enter into written agreements with any third party receiving Personal Information, requiring the third party to comply with Taco Bell’s privacy policies and applicable laws.</p>

<p>From time to time Taco Bell may offer online services or features in connection with a third party company (such as offering downloadable "store finder" mobile software supported by MSN's Virtual Earth) where information about you is collected directly by the third party.

<p>Taco Bell uses appropriate technical and procedural security measures to protect this Site and the data submitted by users.
