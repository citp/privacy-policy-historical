# Privacy

We respect the privacy of our customers and do not sell your personal information to anyone. This privacy statement discloses our information-gathering and dissemination practices. If you have any questions or concerns, we invite you to contact us directly for more information regarding our commitment to your privacy. 

**What Information We Collect and Why:**

We may use our customers’ Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to help diagnose problems with our own technology and to administer the Tactics website. The IP addresses we collect do not link to or reveal any personally identifiable information of our customers. In addition, like virtually all e-commerce sites, we use cookies to keep track of any products in your shopping cart to ensure a successful online ordering process. 

Tactics also uses aggregate demographic and site-traffic data internally, and we may provide this aggregate information about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to trusted third-parties, but this information does not disclose our users’ personally identifiable information. 

Our online Checkout process asks you to give us certain contact information (like your name, address, and email address). We use this information to speed up the order process and to contact you when you request or when it’s absolutely necessary (for example, if there’s a problem fulfilling your order). When you choose to order from us, we must also collect billing and shipping information, including credit card numbers. This information is required to charge you for your purchases, to process and ship your order, and to contact you if there’s any problem with your order. In order to process payment information and fulfill our customers’ orders, some billing and shipping information is provided to trusted third-parties such as credit card processing institutions and carriers like UPS. They do not use this information for secondary purposes, however. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, visit www.networkadvertising.org. 

Tactics may occasionally use registration or order information to contact you about our promotions, special events, or to send you a catalog. In addition, at times Tactics may send offers to you on behalf of other selected businesses. However, we do not give those businesses your personal information. If you are not interested in receiving communications about Tactics, or offers made on behalf of other businesses, you may opt-out of receiving such future communications (see below). 

**Opting Out:**

If you are no longer interested in receiving communications from Tactics, you have several options for terminating any future contact. To stop receiving communications from us, you can use any of the following methods (please specify whether you would like to stop receiving communications about Tactics, offers made on behalf of other businesses, or both):
