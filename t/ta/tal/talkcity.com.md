Info Central: Privacy Policy

Talk City is concerned about protecting your privacy. The following outlines our policies for information gathering and dissemination. 

**Registration**

Any visitor who wishes to chat, or use other free or premium (paid) services available on the Talk City site is asked to complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give some information such as name, email address, birth date information, gender, country of residence and zip code if applicable. Certain services may additionally require that users provide postal mailing addresses, credit-card or other billing information. Optional data fields such as marital status, household income, interest areas, etc. may be included. We encourage our users to register and provide all mandatory and optional information so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. Users may need to register more than once for certain services offered by Talk City and/or its marketing partners and/or previously provided registration information may be used to "pre-populate" a registration form when a user registers for a new Talk City service. 

We use the information we collect from our members during the registration process(s) to allow us to deliver, and in appropriate cases bill members for desired services, to make Talk City and its marketing partners more responsive to users, and to help us customize the service and target advertising, sponsorships, and email offers from us and our business partners based on our members' demographics, likes, dislikes, and affiliations. 

At our discretion, we will make aggregate information about Talk City's users available to help describe and identify our users to business partners, co-branded sites, the industry, and the public, as well as our advertisers. In certain cases we may also share discrete information about a user to a marketing partner to enable that partner to work with Talk City to deliver the desired service to the user. The need to use such explicit user data will be made known to the user at the time the service is requested and user acceptance of the service shall constitute authorization of the right of Talk City to use that explicit data for the sole purchase of such deliver of service. Talk City will not share any detailed information with other companies without the user's express knowledge and consent to the need to do so.
