<p>Taleo Corporation and its affiliated companies (Taleo) provides this  Web Site Privacy Statement to explain how we collect, use, and disclose  certain personal information online. Taleo also has a separate privacy  statement that applies to certain personal data that Taleo receives in  the United States from the European Union and Switzerland, called the <a href="/privacy/privacy-policy#EU">Safe Harbor  Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
<p>This Web Site Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for  Taleo.com. Taleo Corporation is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy  Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to  advance privacy and trust in the networked world. As Taleo wants to  demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed, with respect  to this Web site, to disclose its information practices and have its  privacy practices monitored for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
<p>The TRUSTe program only covers information that is collected through  this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected  through any software downloaded from this Web site.</p>
<p>This Website Privacy Statement notifies you of:</p>
<ul class="main1col flnone">
    <li>The organization collecting the information;</li>
    <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you  through this Web site;</li>
    <li>How the information may be used;</li>
    <li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and  distribution of the information;</li>
    <li>With whom the information may be shared;</li>

TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Taleo to resolve  your concerns.</p>
<h3 class="header-gray">How Personal Information is Collected and Used</h3>
<p>Generally, you can visit Taleo on the Web without telling us who you  are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.  We collect no such information about you when you visit our sites,  unless you choose to provide that information to us.</p>
<p>The types of Personal Information we may collect about you through  our sites include contact and identifying information (name, address,  email address, phone and fax numbers, institution, title or job  position), information about your interest in Taleo products or  services, information about your interest in newsletters, seminars, or  other services that we provide (solely or jointly with others),  information provided in connection with the registration of your  organization for certain solutions (such as Taleo Business Edition and  Taleo Enterprise), information about other transactions that you or your  organization may enter with Taleo, and any other Personal Information  that you may provide to us in an online form or through an email.</p>
<p>Where we collect Personal Information through online forms, we will  notify you of which fields are mandatory for the particular service or  functionality you are requesting (i.e., through the use of an asterisk  (*) next to such mandatory field), and which fields are optional. If you  choose to provide information that is optional, we may use and disclose  such information for the purposes described below.</p>
<p>We may use Personal Information to provide newsletters and other  requested information, to register you for seminars as requested, to  answer questions and inquiries, to conduct activities in connection with  the performance of requested or ongoing transactions, to conduct  surveys in which you elect to participate, and where appropriate, to  provide you with further information about our products and services.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Agents</h4>
<p>We may use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a  credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These  companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable  information for any other purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Financial Information</h4>
<p>We offer some limited products (such as Taleo Business Edition) and  event registration that you may wish to purchase online. To complete  these online financial transactions, our sites may request Personal  Information including contact information (such as name, title, email  address or shipping address) and credit card billing information.  Disclosure of this information is completely voluntary and you have a  choice whether or not to disclose this information.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Surveys &amp; Contests</h4>
<p>From time-to-time our sites may request Personal Information from you  in connection with surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys  or contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not  to disclose this information. Personal Information requested may  include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and  demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be  used to notify the winners and award prizes, and may also be used to  provide you with additional information about our products or services,  or those of our selected business partners.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms</h4>
<p>If you use a bulletin board, discussion forum, or chat room on this  site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information  you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these  forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not  responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to  submit in these forums. There are also testimonials from our clients on  this site. They have consented to showing their personally identifiable  information as part of the testimonial.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Career Section Registration</h4>
<p>Our Candidate Profiler requires a valid email address as a login.  This permits us to contact you if your job preferences match any job  opportunities posted at our site. Except for a valid email address and  geographical location information, all other information you are asked  to submit is optional and voluntary. For example, candidates may  voluntarily choose to attach a resume to their profile, or opt to  receive notifications about future job openings from Taleo. We will make  this Personal Information available to our recruiters and select  employees worldwide, as well as third parties, such as background  checking organizations, as necessary or appropriate based on a relevant  business need to know.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">"Send this to a friend" Option</h4>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our  site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will  automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to  visit the site. We use the information you provided for the sole purpose  of sending this one-time email.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Log Files and Aggregate Information</h4>
<p>Like most standard Web site servers, we collect and use IP addresses  from browsing machines to analyze trends, administer the site, track  pages that have been viewed, and gather broad demographic information  for aggregate use. Taleo does not link this information with Personal  Information about individual users. We reserve the right to share  aggregate and anonymous information with potential partners and other  third parties without restriction.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Use of Cookies and Clear Gifs</h4>
<p>Our sites may use cookies to enhance your experience while visiting  our sites. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to the browsing  computer and used for record-keeping purposes. Cookies generally assist  users by performing certain functions such as saving passwords and  personal preferences regarding the sites. Cookies are linked to  personally identifiable information. Many consider the use of cookies to  be an industry standard.</p>
<p>Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would  prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your  browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse  cookies, it is possible that some areas of our sites will not function  properly when you view them.</p>
<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our  site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy  statement covers the use of cookies by Taleo only and does not cover the  use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p>We employ a third-party product called Eloqua which uses a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web beacons or Web bugs), that help us provide better content on our site by informing us what content is effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to generate an anonymous notice of a visit by a Web user.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We use these technologies to provide you with the products and services you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you and to save you time. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to information about your company and the personal information you have provided to us.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
To learn more about Eloqua’s use of clear gifs, please go to <a href="http://www.eloqua.com/">http://www.eloqua.com/</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.&nbsp; This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.&nbsp; If you would like to opt-out of these emails, or any other communications, you may email us at <a href="mailto:newfeedback@taleo.com?subject=Subcription%20Removal">newfeedback@taleo.com</a>.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Disclosures of Personal Information</h4>
<p>We may disclose Personal Information as necessary or appropriate in  connection with any of the purposes for which we use Personal  Information, including to subcontractors or service providers that help  host or support the sites or otherwise provide technical assistance,  fulfillment companies that help us to provide requested products or  services, and business partners that help conduct seminars or otherwise  provide requested products, services, or information. We also reserve  right to disclose Personal Information in connection with the sale or  transfer of all or part of the business. In these situations where we  transfer Personal Information to these types of third parties, we  require by contract that such third parties must not use or disclose the  information for any purposes other than those specified in this Website  Privacy Policy, and that such third parties must maintain commercially  reasonable security measures to protect the Personal Information. In  situations involving the sale or transfer of all or part of the  business, we will seek to notify users of the ownership change by way of  a prominent notice posted on our Web site. We also reserve the right to  disclose Personal Information in connection with any judicial or  administrative orders, law enforcement requests, or other applicable  legal requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Links</h4>
<p>Our Web Sites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that  Taleo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites,  and this Web Site Privacy Statement does not apply to such sites. We  encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the  privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally  identifiable information.</p>
<h3 class="header-gray">Security</h3>
<p>Taleo takes reasonable technical and organizational measures to  protect the security of our users' Personal Information. When a secure  form asks users to enter Personal Information, that information is  encrypted and protected with the encryption software standard in the  industry - SSL. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of  Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as  opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn  more about SSL, please visit <a href="http://www.comodogroup.com/" target="_blank" title="opens new tab/window">www.comodogroup.com</a>.</p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect certain financial information  online, we also take reasonable steps to protect user information  off-line. All of our users' Personal Information, not just the financial  information mentioned above, is subject to restricted access in our  offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific  job (for example, a customer service representative or sales  representative) are granted access to Personal Information. Our  employees must use passwords to gain access to Personal Information.  Furthermore, all employees are regularly informed about our security and  privacy practices. When new policies are added, our employees are  notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and  what they can do to protect our users' and customers' Personal  Information. Finally, we maintain reasonable technical and  organizational measures to make sure that the servers on which we store  Personal Information are kept in an access-restricted, physically  secure, and monitored environment.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can  send an email to <a href="mailto:infosecurity@taleo.com" title="opens
your email program">infosecurity@taleo.com</a>.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Changes to this Web Site Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>If we decide to change this Web Site Privacy Statement, we will post  the revised policy at this location, or at another location that is  accessible via link from our homepages, so that users are always aware  of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances,  if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personal  Information in a manner that is substantially different from that stated  at the time it was collected, we will seek to notify users by way of an  email, and provide users with a choice as to whether or not we use  their information in this different manner.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Unsubscribe or Modify Information</h4>
<p>We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your Personal  Information. If your Personal Information changes (such as zip code,  phone, email or postal address), and you wish to update or delete the  Personal Information that we maintain about you, please email our Web  Producer at <a href="mailto:website-feedback@taleo.com?subject=Feedback%20from%20Website" title="opens your email program">website-feedback@taleo.com</a>. Also,  if you wish to unsubscribe from any of our newsletters or other  communications, you may also email us at <a href="mailto:website-feedback@taleo.com?subject=Feedback%20from%20Website" title="opens your email program">website-feedback@taleo.com</a>. TRUSTe  requires a response to an access request provided within 30 days of  submitting the request.</p>

<p><a href="/privacy/privacy-policy#top" style="font-size: 11px;" class="flright">Back To Top</a></p>
<p><a href="https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx" target="_blank">We self-certify compliance with:</a></p>
<a title="opens new tab/window" target="_blank" href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/"> <img width="200" height="82" alt="US - EU Safe Harbor" src="/sites/default/files/privacy-safeharbor.png"><br>
<br>
</a>
<p>This Statement describes how Taleo Corporation and its affiliated  companies ("Taleo") collects, uses, and discloses certain personally  identifiable information that it receives in the United States from the  European Union and Switzerland ("EU and Swiss Personal Data"). In  particular, Taleo recognizes that the European Union and Switzerland  have established strict protections regarding the handling of EU and  Swiss Personal Data, and Taleo therefore has elected to adhere to the  US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and US-Switzerland Safe Harbor  Privacy Principles (together, the "Safe Harbors") with respect to such  EU and Swiss Personal Data that it receives in the United States. For  further background and information about the Safe Harbors, and to see  Taleo's representation on the Safe Harbor List, please refer to the U.S.  Department of Commerce's website at <a title="opens
new tab/window" target="_blank" href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
<h3 class="header-gray">Categories of Individual Data Subjects</h3>
<p>In general, Taleo may obtain EU and Swiss Personal Data in the United  States about several different types of individuals, including (i)  website visitors, (ii) clients, suppliers, and business partners, (iii)  candidates for employment with clients, and (iv) Taleo's own employees.  Taleo's practices with respect to each of these types of individual data  subjects are described below.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Website Visitors</h4>
<p>Taleo generally collects, uses, and discloses information about  website visitors located in the EU or Switzerland in accordance with the  Website Privacy Policy at <a href="/privacy/privacy-policy">www.taleo.com/privacy/privacy-policy</a>.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Clients, Suppliers, and Business Partners</h4>
<p>Taleo may obtain various types of EU and Swiss Personal Data about  employees and agents of our clients, suppliers, and business partners.  Such data may include contact information (names, titles, addresses,  phone and fax numbers, and email addresses); information about products  and services ordered or provided; financial and payment information;  user ID, passwords, and information collected through Internet-based and  e-commerce activities, and other transaction-related data.</p>
<p>Taleo may use these types of EU and Swiss Personal Data for business  purposes, including to deliver or provide products or services; to  establish or maintain client and business relationships; to provide  access to Internet-based and e-commerce activities; to perform  accounting functions; and to conduct other activities as necessary or  appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the  business relationship.</p>
<p>Employees and agents of our clients, business partners, and suppliers  may contact us if any of their EU and Swiss Personal Data changes, or  if they would like to access and correct EU and Swiss Personal Data that  we maintain about them. However, such persons might first wish to  contact their local human resources representative (i.e. the human  resources representative within our Clients), as that might be the most  efficient means of addressing their issues. In any event, such persons  can also contact us by sending an email to <a title="opens your email program" href="mailto:privacyofficer@taleo.com?subject=Taleo%20Privacy%20Office">Taleo Privacy Office</a>, or by using  the information at the end of this privacy statement. Also, to the  extent that any of these individuals receive marketing communications  from Taleo, and wish to unsubscribe or otherwise stop receiving such  communications, they can contact us at <a title="opens your email program" href="mailto:website-feedback@taleo.com?subject=Feedback%20from%20Website">website-feedback@taleo.com</a>.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Candidates for Employment with Clients</h4>
<p>Taleo provides a wide variety of services and solutions to its  business clients ("Clients") that facilitate recruiting, hiring,  compensation, performance management and internal mobility of  individuals  ("Data Subjects"). In some instances, Taleo may obtain  access to EU and Swiss Personal Data about such Data Subjects in the  course of providing the services and solutions. In other specific  instances, Taleo may also obtain access to data about our Clients'  existing employees or end users in the course of providing support  services to the Clients ("End Users"). Such data may include contact  details, work history, educational history, work preferences, and other  information, depending on the particular Client and application at  issue.</p>
<p>Wherever we obtain access to EU and Swiss Personal Data about Data  Subjects or End Users, we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf  of our Clients, and we therefore conduct such activities strictly in  accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual  arrangements with them. If you are a candidate for employment with one  of our Clients, an employee of one of our Clients, or an End User with  an existing relationship with one of our Clients, you should refer to  the Client's website or human resources manager to understand the  privacy practices that apply to EU and Swiss Personal Data that we may  maintain about you. Moreover, if you would like to access and review  your EU and Swiss Personal Data, you should contact our Client (your  potential or existing employer) with any such requests. We will  cooperate as appropriate with requests from our Clients to assist with  such responses.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Taleo Employees</h4>
<p>Taleo employees located in the European Union should consult with  their local human resources manager to obtain information about Taleo's  practices with respect their EU and Swiss Personal Data. Online job  applicants to Taleo should also consult any additional terms that apply  when they submit their applications and/or resumes.</p>
<h3 class="header-gray">Other Necessary Disclosures</h3>
<p>Taleo may disclose EU and Swiss Personal Data to business partners  and subcontractors as necessary in connection with the performance of  requested services or solutions, or as otherwise appropriate in  connection with a legitimate business need. Taleo may also disclose EU  and Swiss Personal Data as necessary in connection with the sale or  transfer of all or part of the business. In these situations, Taleo will  require the recipient of the data to protect the data in accordance  with the relevant principles in the Safe Harbors, or otherwise take  steps to ensure that the EU and Swiss Personal Data is appropriately  protected. Taleo may also disclose EU and Swiss Personal Data where  required or permitted by law, or where Taleo believes that such  disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement  request.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Data Security and Integrity</h4>
<p>Taleo has global hosting centers that store and process EU and Swiss  Personal Data in various locations in the United States, including  California. Taleo takes reasonable precautions to protect EU and Swiss  Personal Data in these centers and in other locations in the United  States from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,  alteration, and destruction. Taleo also makes reasonable efforts to keep  EU and Swiss Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate,  current, and complete.</p>
<h4 class="subhead">Questions</h4>
