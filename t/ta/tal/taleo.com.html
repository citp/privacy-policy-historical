					<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>

					<p>Effective on: July 1, 2004</p>
					
					<p>Taleo Corporation and its affiliated companies (STaleo ) provides this Web Site Privacy Statement to explain how we collect, use, and disclose certain personal information online. Taleo also has a separate privacy statement that applies to certain personal data that Taleo receives in the United States from the European Union, called the <a href="EU-safe-harbor.php">EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
					
					<p>This Web Site Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for www.Taleo.com. Taleo Corporation is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because Taleo wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it discloses its website information practices (set forth below) and permits TRUSTe to review its website privacy practices. This Website Privacy Statement notifies you of:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>The organization collecting the information;</li>
						<li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through this Web site;</li>
						<li>How the information may be used;</li>
						<li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information ;</li>
						<li>With whom the information may be shared;</li>
						<li>The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Taleo Corp. control; and</li>
						<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Web Site Privacy Statement, you should first contact <a href="mailto:website-feedback@taleo.com?subject=Feedback from WebSite">website-feedback@taleo.com</a> by email. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe through its <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">Watchdog Dispute Resolution Process</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.</p>
					
					<h2>How Personal Information is Collected and Used</h2>
					<p>Generally, you can visit Taleo on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. We collect no such information about you when you visit our sites, unless you choose to provide that information to us.</p>
					<p>The types of Personal Information we may collect about you through our sites include contact and identifying information (name, address, email address, phone and fax numbers, institution, title or job position), information about your interest in Taleo products or services, information about your interest in newsletters, seminars, or other services that we provide (solely or jointly with others), information provided in connection with the registration of your organization for certain solutions (such as STaleo Contingent ), information about other transactions that you or your organization may enter with Taleo, and any other Personal Information that you may provide to us in an online form or through an email.</p>
					<p>Where we collect Personal Information through online forms, we will notify you of which fields are mandatory for the particular service or functionality you are requesting (i.e., through the use of an asterisk (*) next to such mandatory field), and which fields are optional. If you choose to provide information that is optional, we may use and disclose such information for the purposes described below.</p>
					<p>We may use Personal Information to provide newsletters and other requested information, to register you for seminars as requested, to answer questions and inquiries, to conduct activities in connection with the performance of requested or ongoing transactions, to conduct surveys in which you elect to participate, and where appropriate, to provide you with further information about our products and services.</p>
					
					<h2>Agents</h2>
					<p>We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>

					<h2>Service Providers</h2>
					<p>We use other third parties Verisign to provide credit card processing on our site.  When you sign up for the purchase of a White Paper, we will share your credit card information as necessary for the third party to provide that service.</p>

					<h2>Financial Information</h2>
					<p>We offer some limited products (such as research reports) and seminar registration that you may wish to purchase online. To complete these online financial transactions, our sites may request Personal Information including contact information (such as name, title, email address or shipping address) and credit card billing information. Disclosure of this information is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.</p>
										
					<h2>Surveys &amp; Contests</h2>
					<p>From time-to-time our sites may request Personal Information from you in connection with surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Personal Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes, and may also be used to provide you with additional information about our products or services, or those of our selected business partners.</p>
					
					<h2>Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms</h2>
					<p>If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.   We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

					<h2>Career Section Registration</h2>
					<p>Our Candidate Profiler requires a valid email address as a login. This permits us to contact you if your job preferences match any job opportunities posted at our site. Except for a valid email address and geographical location information, all other information you are asked to submit is optional and voluntary. For example, candidates may voluntarily choose to attach a resume to their profile, or opt to receive notifications about future job openings from Taleo. We will make this Personal Information available to our recruiters and select employees worldwide, as well as third parties, such as background checking organizations, as necessary or appropriate based on a relevant business need to know.</p>
					
					<h2>"Send this job to a friend" Option</h2>
					<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Taleo does not store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</p>
					
					<h2>Log Files and Aggregate Information</h2>
					<p>Like most standard Web site servers, we collect and use IP addresses from browsing machines to analyze trends, administer the site, track pages that have been viewed, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Taleo does not link this information with Personal Information about individual users. We reserve the right to share aggregate and anonymous information with potential partners and other third parties without restriction.</p>
					
					<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
					<p>Our sites may use cookies to enhance your experience while visiting our sites. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to the browsing computer and used for record-keeping purposes. Cookies generally assist users by performing certain functions such as saving passwords and personal preferences regarding the sites. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard.</p> 
					<p>Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our sites will not function properly when you view them.</p>
						<p>Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Taleo only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
						<h2>Disclosures of Personal Information</h2>
					<p>We may disclose Personal Information as necessary or appropriate in connection with any of the purposes for which we use Personal Information, including to subcontractors or service providers that help host or support the sites or otherwise provide technical assistance, fulfillment companies that help us to provide requested products or services, and business partners that help conduct seminars or otherwise provide requested products, services, or information. We also reserve right to disclose Personal Information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In these situations where we transfer Personal Information to these types of third parties, we require by contract that such third parties must not use or disclose the information for any purposes other than those specified in this Website Privacy Policy, and that such third parties must maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the Personal Information. In situations involving the sale or transfer of all or part of the business, we will seek to notify users of the ownership change by way of a prominent notice posted on our Web site. We also reserve the right to disclose Personal Information in connection with any judicial or administrative orders, law enforcement requests, or other applicable legal requirements.</p>
					
					<h2>Links</h2>
					<p>Our Web Sites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Taleo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites, and this Web Site Privacy Statement does not apply to such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
					
					<h2>Security</h2>
					<p>Taleo takes reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the security of our users' Personal Information. When our contact form or seminar sign-up form asks users to enter Personal Information, that information is encrypted and protected with the encryption software standard in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our contact form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, please visit <a href="http://www.comodogroup.com" target="_blank">www.comodogroup.com</a>.</p>
					<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect certain financial information online, we also take reasonable steps to protect user information off-line. All of our users' Personal Information, not just the financial information mentioned above, is subject to restricted access in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative or sales representative) are granted access to Personal Information. Our employees must use passwords to gain access to Personal Information. Furthermore, all employees are regularly informed about our security and privacy practices. When new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to protect our users" and customers' Personal Information. Finally, we maintain reasonable technical and organizational measures to make sure that the servers on which we store Personal Information are kept in an access restricted, physically secure, and monitored environment.</p>
					<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@taleo.com?subject=Feedback from WebSite">security@taleo.com</a>.</p>
					
					<h2>Changes to this Web Site Privacy Statement</h2>
					<p>If we decide to change this Web Site Privacy Statement, we will post the revised policy at this location, or at another location that is accessible via link from our homepages, so that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personal Information in a manner that is substantially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will seek to notify users by way of an email, and provide users with a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.</p>
					
					<h2>Unsubscribe or Modify Information</h2>
					<p>We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your Personal Information. If your Personal Information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), and you wish to update the Personal Information that we maintain about you, please email our Web Producer at <a href="mailto:website-feedback@taleo.com?subject=Feedback from WebSite">website-feedback@taleo.com</a>. Also, if you wish to unsubscribe from any of our newsletters or other communications, you may also email us at <a href="mailto:website-feedback@taleo.com?subject=Feedback from WebSite">website-feedback@taleo.com</a>. TRUSTe requires a response to an access request provided within 30 days of submitting the request.</p>

					<h1>Taleo Corporation<br>EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement</h1>
					<p>This Statement describes how Taleo Corporation and its affiliated companies (“Taleo”) collects, uses, and discloses certain personally identifiable information that it receives in the United States from the European Union (“EU Personal Data”). In particular, Taleo recognizes that the European Union has established strict protections regarding the handling of EU Personal Data, and Taleo therefore has elected to adhere to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (“EU Safe Harbor”) with respect to such EU Personal Data that it receives in the United States. For further background and information about the EU Safe Harbor, please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
					
					<h2>Categories of Individual Data Subjects</h2>
					<p>In general, Taleo may obtain EU Personal Data in the United States about several different types of individuals, including (i) website visitors, (ii) clients, suppliers, and business partners, (iii) candidates for employment with clients, and (iv) Taleo’s own employees. Taleo’s practices with respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.</p>
					
					<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
					<p>Taleo generally collects, uses, and discloses information about website visitors located in the EU in accordance with the Website Privacy Policy <a href="privacy-policy.php">www.taleo.com/privacy/privacy-policy.php</a>.</p>
					
					<h2>Clients, Suppliers, and Business Partners</h2>
					<p>Taleo may obtain various types of EU Personal Data about employees and agents of our clients, suppliers, and business partners. Such data may include contact information (names, titles, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses); information about products and services ordered or provided; financial and payment information; user ID, passwords, and information collected through Internet-based and e-commerce activities, and other transaction-related data.</p>
					<p>Taleo may use these types of EU Personal Data for business purposes, including to deliver or provide products or services; to establish or maintain client and business relationships; to provide access to Internet-based and e-commerce activities; to perform accounting functions; and to conduct other activities as necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business relationship.</p>
					<p>Employees and agents of our clients, business partners, and suppliers may contact us if any of their EU Personal Data changes, or if they would like to access and correct EU Personal Data that we maintain about them. However, such persons might first wish to contact their local human resources representative (i.e. the human resources representative within our Clients), as that might be the most efficient means of addressing their issues. In any event, such persons can also contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:shardaway@taleo.com?subject=Taleo Privacy Office">Taleo Privacy Office</a>, or by using the information at the end of this privacy statement. Also, to the extent that any of these individuals receive marketing communications from Taleo, and wish to unsubscribe or otherwise stop receiving such communications, they can contact us at <a href="mailto:website-feedback@taleo.com?subject=Feedback from WebSite">website-feedback@taleo.com</a>.</p>
					
					<h2>Candidates for Employment with Clients</h2>
					<p>Taleo provides a wide variety of services and solutions to its business clients (“Clients”) that facilitate the selection, hiring, and internal mobility of individual candidates for specific employment (“Candidates”). In some instances, Taleo may obtain access to EU Personal Data about such Candidates in the course of providing the services and solutions. In other specific instances, Taleo may also obtain access to data about our Clients’ existing employees or end users in the course of providing support services to the Clients (“End Users”). Such data may include contact details, work history, educational history, work preferences, and other information, depending on the particular Client and application at issue.</p>
					<p>Wherever we obtain access to EU Personal Data about Candidates or End Users, we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf of our Clients, and we therefore conduct such activities strictly in accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them. If you are a Candidate for employment with one of our Clients, or an End User with an existing relationship with one of our Clients, you should refer to the Client’s website or human resources manager to understand the privacy practices that apply to EU Personal Data that we may maintain about you. Moreover, if you would like to access and review your EU Personal Data, you should contact our Client (your potential or existing employer) with any such requests. We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our Clients to assist with such responses.</p>
					
					<h2>Taleo Employees</h2>
					<p>Taleo employees located in the European Union should consult with their local human resources manager to obtain information about Taleo’s practices with respect their EU Personal Data. Online job applicants to Taleo should also consult any additional terms that apply when they submit their applications and/or resumes.</p>
					
					<h2>Other Necessary Disclosures</h2>
					<p>Taleo may disclose EU Personal Data to business partners and subcontractors as necessary in connection with the performance of requested services or solutions, or as otherwise appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need. Taleo may also disclose EU Personal Data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In these situations, Taleo will require the recipient of the data to protect the data in accordance with the relevant principles in the EU Safe Harbor, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data is appropriately protected. Taleo may also disclose EU Personal Data where required or permitted by law, or where Taleo believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request.</p>
					
					<h2>Data Security and Integrity</h2>
					<p>Taleo has global hosting centers that store and process EU Personal Data in New York and California. Taleo takes reasonable precautions to protect EU Personal Data in these centers and in other locations in the United States from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Taleo also makes reasonable efforts to keep EU Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete.</p>

					<p>If you have any questions about this EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement, or if you would like to request access to EU Personal Data that we may maintain about you, please contact us as follows:</p>
