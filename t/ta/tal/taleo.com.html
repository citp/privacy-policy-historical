							<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>Taleo is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. Taleo collects information from our users at several different points on our Web Site.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Log Files</b><br>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Taleo does not associate any of this information with individual users.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Contact and Seminar Registration<br>
							</b>In order to receive additional information on our product or to participate in a free seminar, users must first complete a contact form. In filling out this form, users are required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact users about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. Users may provide additional information (such as Number of Employees in the Company), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized response from our personnel. This information may be used for future correspondence purposes.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Newsletter Registration<br>
							</b>In order to receive Taleo's newsletter, users must first complete a contact form. In filling out this form, users are required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). Users may provide additional information (such as Phone Number or Fax Number). This information is used to contact users about the Taleo's newsletter. This information may be used for future correspondence purposes.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Sharing</b><br>
							We may share aggregated demographic information with potential partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person or company.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Links</b><br>This Web Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Taleo Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site and does not reflect the privacy practices of our clients.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Email Links</b><br>
							This Web Site contains Email links to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. Every Email is read, and the information you provide is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments in order to improve our site or review and discard the information.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
							From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site or in aggregate form only.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Career Section Registration</b><br>Our Candidate Profiler requires a valid Email address as a login. This permits us to contact you if your preferences match with job opportunities available at our site. Except for a valid Email address and geographical location information all other information submitted is optional and voluntary. The user may equally choose to opt out from receiving future job offerings from Taleo. Candidates may also voluntarily choose to attach their resume to their profile. Information supplied is stored in Taleo's database and is not available to any outside source; viewing is limited to Taleo Human Resources personnel and staffing managers.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Anonymous Registration</b><br>Candidates may choose to search and/or apply anonymously for jobs posted on Taleo's Web Site. A user may register with the Candidate Profiler as an Anonymous candidate, by simply providing a valid Email address and geographical location information. Any other information is given on a voluntary basis; information is stored in Taleo's database and is not available to any outside source; viewing is limited to Taleo Human Resources personnel and staffing managers.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>"Send this job to a friend" Option</b><br>Any job posted on Taleo's site may be forwarded to someone else by clicking on the "Send this job to a friend" link at the bottom of each job description. The user must provide the recipient's Email address and an Email address for themselves. The content of the subject line is not modifiable to prevent spamming. This information serves only to forward the job description to the recipient and to let them know who sent it. The user may also include a brief message to the recipient. None of the information in this option is recorded or used for any other purpose.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Security</b><br>
							This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected as stated above both online and off-line.</p>
						<p>When our contact form or seminar sign-up form asks users to enter personal information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software standard in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our contact form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.comodogroup.com" target="_blank">www.comodogroup.com</a>.</p>
						<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative or sales representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a restricted, monitored environment.</p>
						<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@recruitsoft.com">security@recruitsoft.com</a>.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
							If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we would notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
						<p><br>

							<b>Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
							
							We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our Web site.</p>
						<p><br>
