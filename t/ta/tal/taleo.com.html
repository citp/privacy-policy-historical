							<b>How Personal Information is Collected and Used</b><br>
							Generally, you can visit Taleo on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.  We collect no such information about you when you visit our sites, unless you choose to provide that information to us.</p>
						<p>The types of Personal Information we may collect about you through our sites include contact and identifying information (name, address, email address, phone and fax numbers, institution, title or job position), information about your interest in Taleo products or services, information about your interest in newsletters, seminars, or other services that we provide (solely or jointly with others), information provided in connection with the registration of your organization for certain solutions (such as “Taleo Contingent”), information about other transactions that you or your organization may enter with Taleo, and any other Personal Information that you may provide to us in an online form or through an email.</p>
						<p>Where we collect Personal Information through online forms, we will notify you of which fields are mandatory for the particular service or functionality you are requesting (i.e., through the use of an asterisk (*) next to such mandatory field), and which fields are optional.  If you choose to provide information that is optional, we may use and disclose such information for the purposes described below.</p>
						<p>We may use Personal Information to provide newsletters and other requested information, to register you for seminars as requested, to answer questions and inquiries, to conduct activities in connection with the performance of requested or ongoing transactions, to conduct surveys in which you elect to participate, and where appropriate, to provide you with further information about our products and services.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Financial Information<br>
							</b>We offer some limited products (such as research reports) and seminar registration that you may wish to purchase online.  To complete these online financial transactions, our sites may request Personal Information including contact information (such as name, title, email address or shipping address) and credit card billing information. Disclosure of this information is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Surveys &amp; Contests<br>
							</b>From time-to-time our sites may request Personal Information from you in connection with surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Personal Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes, and may also be used to provide you with additional information about our products or services, or those of our selected business partners.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Career Section Registration<br>
							</b>Our Candidate Profiler requires a valid email address as a login. This permits us to contact you if your job preferences match any job opportunities posted at our site. Except for a valid email address and geographical location information, all other information you are asked to submit is optional and voluntary. For example, candidates may voluntarily choose to attach a resume to their profile, or opt to receive notifications about future job openings from Taleo. We will make this Personal Information available to our recruiters and select employees worldwide, as well as third parties, such as background checking organizations, as necessary or appropriate based on a relevant business need to know.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>"Send this job to a friend" Option<br>
							</b>Any job posted on Taleo's site may be forwarded to someone else by clicking on the "Send this job to a friend" link at the bottom of each job description. The user must provide his or her own email address and the recipient's email address. We collect this Personal Information for purposes of forwarding the job description to the recipient and identifying to the recipient who sent it. The user may also include a brief message to the recipient. To prevent spamming, the content of the subject line is not modifiable.  The Personal Information obtained through the “Send this job to a friend” feature is generally not used for any purpose other than in connection with providing this service.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Log Files and Aggregate Information<br>
							</b>Like most standard Web site servers, we collect and use IP addresses from browsing machines to analyze trends, administer the site, track pages that have been viewed, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Taleo does not link this information with Personal Information about individual users.  We reserve the right to share aggregate and anonymous information with potential partners and other third parties without restriction.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Use of Cookies<br>
							</b>Our sites may use cookies to enhance your experience while visiting our sites. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to the browsing computer and used for record-keeping purposes. Cookies generally assist users by performing certain functions such as saving passwords and personal preferences regarding the sites. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard. <br>
							Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our sites will not function properly when you view them.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Disclosures of Personal Information<br>
							</b>We may disclose Personal Information as necessary or appropriate in connection with any of the purposes for which we use Personal Information, including to subcontractors or service providers that help host or support the sites or otherwise provide technical assistance, fulfillment companies that help us to provide requested products or services, and business partners that help conduct seminars or otherwise provide requested products, services, or information.  We also reserve right to disclose Personal Information in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business.  In these situations where we transfer Personal Information to these types of third parties, we require by contract that such third parties must not use or disclose the information for any purposes other than those specified in this Website Privacy Policy, and that such third parties must maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect the Personal Information. In situations involving the sale or transfer of all or part of the business, we will seek to notify users of the ownership change by way of a prominent notice posted on our Web site. We also reserve the right to disclose Personal Information in connection with any judicial or administrative orders, law enforcement requests, or other applicable legal requirements.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Links<br>
							</b>Our Web Sites may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Taleo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites, and this Web Site Privacy Statement does not apply to such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Security<br>
							</b>Taleo takes reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the security of our users' Personal Information. When our contact form or seminar sign-up form asks users to enter Personal Information, that information is encrypted and protected with the encryption software standard in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our contact form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, please visit <a href="http://www.comodogroup.com" target="_blank">www.comodogroup.com</a>.</p>
						<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect certain financial information online, we also take reasonable steps to protect user information off-line. All of our users' Personal Information, not just the financial information mentioned above, is subject to restricted access in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative or sales representative) are granted access to Personal Information. Our employees must use passwords to gain access to Personal Information. Furthermore, all employees are regularly informed about our security and privacy practices. When new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to protect our users’ and customers' Personal Information. Finally, we maintain reasonable technical and organizational measures to make sure that the servers on which we store Personal Information are kept in an access restricted, physically secure, and monitored environment.</p>
						<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@taleo.com" target="_blank">security@taleo.com</a>.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Changes to this Web Site Privacy Statement<br>
							</b>If we decide to change this Web Site Privacy Statement, we will post the revised policy at this location, or at another location that is accessible via link from our homepages, so that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personal Information in a manner that is substantially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will seek to notify users by way of an email, and provide users with a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.</p>
						<p><br>
							<b>Unsubscribe or Modify Information<br>
							</b>We intend to protect the quality and integrity of your Personal Information. If your Personal Information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), and you wish to update the Personal Information that we maintain about you, please email our Web Coordinator at <a href="mailto:WebSite-Feedback@taleo.com">WebSite-Feedback@taleo.com</a>.  Also, if you wish to unsubscribe from any of our newsletters or other communications, you may also email us at <a href="mailto:WebSite-Feedback@taleo.com">WebSite-Feedback@taleo.com</a>.</p>
