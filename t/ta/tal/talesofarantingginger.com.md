# Privacy, disclosure & Giveaway Policy | Tales of a Ranting Ginger

Thank you for entering a giveaway on **Tales of a Ranting Ginger**. Giveaways are a great way for companies to help promote a product or campaign. All opinions expressed are honest and of my own. Any information taken from a second source is quoted or referenced. As a Canadian mom blogger I try my best to always keep my readers I mind when accepting giveaways. So most often they are open to Canada 

**Rules** – Giveaways hosted here are most always open to Canada. Whenever possible they are open to both Canada and USA. If the brands requests, Quebec will be excluded due to laws for that province on prizes over $100

All mandatory entries **MUST** be completed correctly before additional entries are counted. If you do not complete the mandatory entry your additional entries will be deleted.

If you are not eligible for the giveaway (see rules within post) your entries will not be counted. 

All entries are always verified. 

Please leave your Twitter ID and Facebook name (first and last initial) for these kinds of entries. 

Tweet entries MUST include the URL to your tweet (right click on time stamp in tweet to get this). 

Newsletter subscriptions must be verified in your inbox to count. If your twitter account is private I can not verify and will request a follow to see your tweets. 

**_Winners MUST confirm their win notification within 48 hours of the winners email being sent. If you do not respond, a new winner will be  selected._**

**IP addresses**. If it is assumed the same person has entered using multiple emails or changed names for multiple entries, your entries will be deleted and not counted. We understand that schools, families and work places have multiple people entering. This decision will be at the discretion of the blog owner.

If your prize does not arrive in a timely manner (6-8 weeks) please send me an email (Gingermommyrants at gmail dot com) and I will do my best to track it down and contact the sponsor. Please do not email me looking for your prize before 6 weeks time.  Do not contact the sponsor directly as often the company who runs their websites, social media etc is not the same as who the blogger is dealing with in most cases.
