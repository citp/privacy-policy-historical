**SAFE AND SECURE SHOPPING CART!**

We use the stronghold secure server, currently the second best selling secure server software, and in our opinion, technically the best product. It supports industry-standard 128-bit SSL encryption.

When you enter your credit card number into the order form, it is transmitted across the Internet in an encrypted (scrambled) form, then decoded when it gets to us.

For added security, we also encrypt the credit card number when it is stored on disk, and when we forward it to the merchant.

If you are not the kind of person who worries about being hit by lightning, you probably don't have to worry that your credit card number will be intercepted on the way to a secure Web site. According to CNN, 

> **"The prevalent opinion...is that on-line credit card use is actually no riskier for consumers than traditional "low-tech" transactions."**

We order products online all the time, both as a company and as individuals. When we use a credit card to buy something online, we feel as safe as we would using one in a store or restaurant.
