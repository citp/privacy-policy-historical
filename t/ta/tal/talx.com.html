                                and review the privacy policies of every web site 
                                you visit. </p>
                              <p><strong>General Statistics &amp; Web Site Measurements:</strong><br>
                                We collect aggregate information site-wide, including 
                                anonymous site statistics. We also log domain 
                                names and/or IP addresses. We use your IP address 
                                to help diagnose problems with our server, and 
                                to administer our web site as well as improve 
                                the site-wide experience for you and other users. 
                                We also link IP addresses to personally identifiable 
                                information within our eCommerce site in order 
                                to ensure the security of our service for all 
                                users. In these cases, the IP address and personally 
                                identifiable information becomes part of an audit 
                                trail that we may use to identify the source of 
                                a specific transaction.</p>
                              <p> We identify and track the single, previous Web 
                                site address that visitors come from when accessing 
                                our site. This is standard practice throughout 
                                the Internet, and it is used to determine how 
                                visitors navigate to our sites. We do not, however, 
                                attach this information to anything that is personally 
                                identifiable. In other words, while we may track 
                                what site you came from, we do not directly connect 
                                that information with anything that identifies 
                                you.</p>
                              <p> When a visitor registers, "logs in," 
                                or accesses parts of our site that require the 
                                use of data like usernames and passwords, we may 
                                store a cookie, a small piece of information, 
                                on that visitor's computer. </p>
                              <p>If used, this small file helps to improve the 
                                user's experience by allowing us to customize 
                                or tailor the web pages that the visitor sees 
                                and uses for their specific needs. For example, 
                                we may use a cookie to allow a user to by-pass 
                                having to enter their username every time they 
                                login. For frequent visitors, this type of functionality 
                                and personalization can greatly improve their 
                                experience. These cookies DO NOT contain confidential 
                                or personal information. While we may use cookies 
                                to help us understand and improve the navigation 
                                of our site, we DO NOT use cookies to personally 
                                identify and track the navigation of any specific 
                                visitor. </p>
                              <p>We do not resell, distribute, or disclose any

                                of our site requires users to give us unique identifiers

                              <p><strong>Security &amp; Protection of Your Data</strong><br>
                                This site has security measures in place to protect 
                                the loss, misuse and alteration of the information 
                                under our control. Portions of our site make use 
                                of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, the 
                                Internet's leading encryption standard, as well 
                                as password-like identifying information. SSL 
                                is used to encrypt the information being sent 
                                between a visitor’s computer and our Web 
                                site. <br>
                                <br>
                                Encryption is a process in which the information 
                                being transmitted between two parties is "scrambled" 
                                in transit. SSL encryption creates a secure link 
                                between two computers by establishing a process 
                                in which each computer can unscramble (unencrypt) 
                                the other's information. <br>
                                <br>
                                Your browser should indicate whether or not it 
                                is operating in a secure site. Most browsers will 
                                display an alert box advising you that you are 
                                requesting pages from a secure site, and they 
                                will ask your permission to continue. Most browsers 
                                will also alert you when you are leaving a secure 
                                site, and again, ask you permission to continue. 
                                However, this alert feature can be turned off 
                                within the browser's preferences. If you have 
                                doubts about whether or not you are on a secured 
                                web page, contact the web site's operator to clarify 
                                your questions, and DO NOT transmit sensitive 
                                information like credit card numbers until you 
                                are confident of the page's security.<br>
                                <br>
                                In addition, we take great care to safeguard all 
                                information that is transmitted to us and stored 
                                by us on our computers, servers, and databases. 
                                This protection includes the use of network intrusion 
                                prevention and detection technology as well as 
                                other industry accepted security practices. We 
                                protect the physical location of our systems through 
                                the use of access control and monitoring technologies. 
                                We take extensive measures to limit the risk of 
                                damage or loss of any data due to hazards like 
                                fire, water damage, power loss, etc. <br>
