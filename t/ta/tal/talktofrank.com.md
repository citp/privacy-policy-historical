# Cookie policy | FRANK

Last updated: 25th May 2012

This page explains what you need to know about how talktofrank.com uses cookies on its website and how to manage or remove them if you wish to do so.

**What are cookies?**

A cookie is a small amount of data sent to your computer or mobile phone from a website.  This means the website can recognize your device (your computer or mobile phone) if you return to the same site.  Cookies cannot be used to identify you personally. 

A cookie often includes a unique identifier, which is a randomly generated number.  This is stored on your device’s hard drive.  Many cookies are automatically deleted after you finish using the website.

Cookies are not programs and do not collect information from your device.

Cookies make your experience of using websites faster and easier. They allow websites to create a customised view of pages to which you navigate. For example, they are commonly used to authenticate or identify registered users of a website without requiring them to sign in each time they access it. Other uses include maintaining a ‘shopping basket’ of goods a user has chosen to purchase, site personalisation (presenting different pages to different users) and tracking the pages a user has visited on a site for analysis purposes.

Cookies may come with or without an expiry date. Cookies without an expiry date exist until the browser is closed, while cookies with an expiry date may be stored by the device until the expiry date passes.

You can restrict or block cookies set by FRANK  but this may limit your use of some functionality.

FRANK uses third-party suppliers who also set cookies on our behalf to deliver the services that record usage and monitor advertising. More information on the cookies set by FRANK and its third-party suppliers can be found below.

**How to manage your cookies**

Cookies are sent to your browser (whether you use Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari or any other browser) by a website and then stored in the cookies directory of your device.

To check and update your cookies settings, you will need to know what browser you are using and what version of it you have. You can usually find this out by opening the browser (just as though you were going to use the internet) and then clicking on 'Help' and then 'About'. This will give you information about the browser version you are using.
