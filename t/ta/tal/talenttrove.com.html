<b>USE OF INFORMATION</b><br>
Any visitor of the TalentTrove website can view your profile information and photos that you have uploaded to the TalentTrove community. You can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the TalentTrove website and which network of TalentTrove members can see what information.<br>
To provide you with some of the features that the TalentTrove community offers to its members, we may use Personal Information that is stored in your profile after you have requested such features, for example to send invitation e-mails to people that you specified as being interested in joining the TalentTrove community.

<b>PERSONAL INFORMATION CONNECT VIA TECHNOLOGY</b><br>
As you navigate the Website, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system.

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.

Other third parties may place advertisements and cookies on webpages within the TalentTrove network. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.<br>
