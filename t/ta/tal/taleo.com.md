**How Personal Information is Collected and Used**

Generally, you can visit Taleo on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. We collect no such information about you when you visit our sites, unless you choose to provide that information to us.

The types of Personal Information we may collect about you through our sites include contact and identifying information (name, address, email address, phone and fax numbers, institution, title or job position), information about your interest in Taleo products or services, information about your interest in newsletters, seminars, or other services that we provide (solely or jointly with others), information provided in connection with the registration of your organization for certain solutions (such as Taleo Contingent ), information about other transactions that you or your organization may enter with Taleo, and any other Personal Information that you may provide to us in an online form or through an email.

Where we collect Personal Information through online forms, we will notify you of which fields are mandatory for the particular service or functionality you are requesting (i.e., through the use of an asterisk (*) next to such mandatory field), and which fields are optional. If you choose to provide information that is optional, we may use and disclose such information for the purposes described below.

We may use Personal Information to provide newsletters and other requested information, to register you for seminars as requested, to answer questions and inquiries, to conduct activities in connection with the performance of requested or ongoing transactions, to conduct surveys in which you elect to participate, and where appropriate, to provide you with further information about our products and services.

We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
