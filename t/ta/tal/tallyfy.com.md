# Privacy Policy - Tallyfy

This Privacy Policy describes how Tallyfy collects, uses and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

When we refer to “ **Tallyfy** ”, we mean the Tallyfy, Inc. entity that acts as the controller or processor of your information, as explained in more detail in the “Identifying the Data Controller and Processor” section below.

## Applicability Of This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to Tallyfy’s online business process management tools and platform, including any associated Tallyfy mobile and desktop applications (collectively, the “ **Services** ”), Tallyfy.com and other Tallyfy websites (collectively, the “ **Websites** ”) and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with Tallyfy. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of Tallyfy’s business.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the Tallyfy platform (“ **Third Party Services** ”), or any other third party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the “ **Customer Agreement** ”), including the processing of any messages, files or other content submitted through Services accounts (collectively, “ **Customer Data** ”). The organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person) that entered into the Customer Agreement (“ **Customer** ”) controls their instance of the Services (their “ **Workspace** ”) and any associated Customer Data. If you have any questions about specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use. If you have received an invitation to join a Workspace but have not yet created an account, you should request assistance from the Customer that sent the invitation.

## Information We Collect And Receive

Tallyfy may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (“ **Other Information** ”) in a variety of ways:

  *  **Customer Data**. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (“ **Authorized Users** ”) routinely submit Customer Data to Tallyfy when using the Services.
  *  **Other Information.** Tallyfy also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:
    1. Workspace and Account Information. To create or update a Workspace account, you or your Customer (e.g., your employer) supply Tallyfy with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details. For details on Workspace creation, [click here](https://support.tallyfy.com/). In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Tallyfy (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.
    2. Usage Information.
      *  _Services Metadata_. When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way Authorized Users work. For example, Tallyfy logs the Workspaces, templates, processes, people, features, content and links you interact with, the types of files shared and what Third Party Services are used (if any).
      *  _Log data_. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.
      *  _Device information_. Tallyfy collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.
      *  _Location information_. We receive information from you, your Customer and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. Tallyfy may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.
    3. Cookie Information. Tallyfy uses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the Websites and Services and across other websites and online services.
    4. Third Party Services. Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services for their Workspace. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for their Workspace. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with Tallyfy. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to Tallyfy to facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Tallyfy. When a Third Party Service is enabled, Tallyfy is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to Tallyfy in accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third Party Services when connecting them to the Services.
    5. Contact Information. In accordance with the consent process provided by your device, any contact information that an Authorized User chooses to import (such as an address book from a device) is collected when using the Services.
    6. Third Party Data. Tallyfy may receive data about organizations, industries, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.
    7. Additional Information Provided to Tallyfy. We receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Tallyfy.



Generally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, “ **Information** ”). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.

## How We Use Information

Customer Data will be used by Tallyfy in accordance with Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. Tallyfy is a processor of Customer Data and Customer is the controller. Customer may, for example, use the Services to grant and remove access to a Workspace, assign roles and configure settings, access, modify, export, share and remove Customer Data and otherwise apply its policies to the Services.

Tallyfy uses Other Information in furtherance of our legitimate interests in operating our Services, Websites and business. More specifically, Tallyfy uses Other Information:

  *  **To provide, update, maintain and protect our Services, Websites and business.** This includes use of Other Information to support delivery of the Services under a Customer Agreement, prevent or address service errors, security or technical issues, analyze and monitor usage, trends and other activities or at an Authorized User’s request.
  *  **As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.**
  *  **To communicate with you by responding to your requests, comments and questions.** If you contact us, we may use your Other Information to respond.
  *  **To develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and additional features.** Tallyfy tries to make the Services as useful as possible for specific Workspaces and Authorized Users. For example, we may improve search functionality by using Other Information to help determine and rank the relevance of content, channels or expertise to an Authorized User, make Services suggestions based on historical use and predictive models, identify organizational trends and insights, to customize a Services experience or create new productivity features and products.
  *  **To send emails and other communications.** We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails, messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about Tallyfy. These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.
  *  **For billing, account management and other administrative matters.** Tallyfy may need to contact you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.
  *  **To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.**



If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, Tallyfy may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “ **Personal Data**.”

## Data Retention

Tallyfy will retain Customer Data in accordance with a Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer’s use of Services functionality, and as required by applicable law. Depending on the Services plan, Customer may be able to customize its retention settings and apply those customized settings at the Workspace level or other level. Customer may also apply different settings to templates, processes, files or other types of Customer Data. The deletion of Customer Data and other use of the Services by Customer may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of certain associated Other Information. Tallyfy may retain Other Information pertaining to you for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. This may include keeping your Other Information after you have deactivated your account for the period of time needed for Tallyfy to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
