            <p>Talk City is concerned about protecting your privacy. The following 
              outlines our policies for information gathering and dissemination. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Registration</b></p>
            <p>Any visitor who wishes to chat, or use other free or premium (paid) 
              services available on the Talk City site is asked to complete a 
              registration form. During registration a user is required to give 
              some information such as name, email address, birth date information, 
              gender, country of residence and zip code if applicable. Certain 
              services may additionally require that users provide postal mailing 
              addresses, credit-card or other billing information. Optional data 
              fields such as marital status, household income, interest areas, 
              etc. may be included. We encourage our users to register and provide 
              all mandatory and optional information so we can provide a more 
              personalized experience on our site. Users may need to register 
              more than once for certain services offered by Talk City and/or 
              its marketing partners and/or previously provided registration information 
              may be used to "pre-populate" a registration form when a user registers 
              for a new Talk City service. </p>
            <p>We use the information we collect from our members during the registration 
              process(s) to allow us to deliver, and in appropriate cases bill 
              members for desired services, to make Talk City and its marketing 
              partners more responsive to users, and to help us customize the 
              service and target advertising, sponsorships, and email offers from 
              us and our business partners based on our members' demographics, 
              likes, dislikes, and affiliations. </p>
            <p>At our discretion, we will make aggregate information about Talk 
              City's users available to help describe and identify our users to 
              business partners, co-branded sites, the industry, and the public, 
              as well as our advertisers. In certain cases we may also share discrete 
              information about a user to a marketing partner to enable that partner 
              to work with Talk City to deliver the desired service to the user. 
              The need to use such explicit user data will be made known to the 
              user at the time the service is requested and user acceptance of 
              the service shall constitute authorization of the right of Talk 
              City to use that explicit data for the sole purchase of such deliver 
              of service. Talk City will not share any detailed information with 
              other companies without the user's express knowledge and consent 
              to the need to do so. </p>
            <p><b>Policies for Individuals Under the Age of 13</b></p>
            <p>Talk City is intended for individuals age 13 and over only. We 
              do not accept registrations from children under the age of 13, as 
              we do not provide content for children.&nbsp; <b>PARENTS PLEASE 
              READ:&nbsp; </b>Due to the interactive nature of our site, and in 
              order to comply with Federal laws designed to protect your children 
              on the Internet, we do not permit children to register on our site.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Terms of Service and Talk City Standards</b></p>
            <p>All services on Talk City include Terms of Service and Talk City 
              Standards policies to which any participating member must agree 
              to adhere by. Talk City reserves the right to monitor all activities 
              undertaken by its users while on the Talk City site, or while using 
              any Talk City product or service, in order to ensure that these 
              Terms of Service and City Standards are not violated. This includes, 
              but is not limited to the automatic logging and review of chat room 
              text messaging, and access to all message board folders. In the 
              event that a member violates a Talk City Terms of Service or City 
              Standards policy, Talk City reserves the right to revoke a user's 
              Talk City Membership or use of any free or premium service. In the 
              event that Talk City revokes a premium service for which the member 
              has paid a subscription fee, such revocation of service may, at 
              Talk City's sole discretion, be without refund. </p>
            <p>In the event that a Talk City member is suspected of being in violation 
              with a Talk City Terms of Service or City Standards policy, or with 
              any law, local, state, federal, or otherwise‚ Talk City reserves 
              the right to use, and share with any such law enforcement agency, 
              any and all user data available to it to identify, and communicate 
              with the member in violation and/or as needed in the revocation 
              of its membership, rights to services, or in compliance with the 
              request of any law enforcement agency.</p>
            <p>We invite you to review <u>Terms of Service</u> and <u>City Standards</u> 
              policy.</p>
            <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
            <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer, either 
              temporarily or permanently.&nbsp;&nbsp; The data may contain information 
              specific to the user and his/her relationship with the server that 
              requested that the information be stored.</p>
            <p>Talk City uses cookies to enable the user to log in and use Talk 
              City services.&nbsp; Generally, the user has the ability to reject 
              cookies that servers may wish to set on the user's computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
              The acceptance of cookies from Talk City is required for the use 
              of Talk City services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk City will use cookies only 
              in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, and cannot 
              support the use of Talk City services by users who refuse Talk City 
              cookies.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We use outside, third-party companies to display ads on our site. 
              These ads may contain cookies. These third-party companies may collect 
              and track information associated with cookies received with banner 
              ads, and these companies may use information (not including your 
              name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits 
              to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on 
              this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to 
              you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk City generally does not have access 
              to information collected by such third-party companies, and your 
              acceptance of such third-party cookies is not required as a condition 
              of your use of Talk City. </p>
            <p><b>Log Files</b></p>
            <p>We track use of Talk City services to provide users with a more 
              personalized experience, to help diagnose problems with our servers 
              to administer our Web site, and to identify those that attempt to 
              disrupt our services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally identifiable information 
              may be extracted in this process, when necessary to identify, communicate 
              and take appropriate action in incidents where a member is in violation 
              of a Talk City Terms of Service or City Standards policy. In such 
              instances, this information is used only by Talk City management 
              in the enforcing of such policies or by external law enforcement 
              agencies as may be requested and/or required by law.</p>
            <p>We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate 
              form to allow us to update and improve our site, and tell other 
              people something about the numbers of people who participate in 
              Talk City services.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Links</b></p>
            <p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that 
              Talk City is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other 
              sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site 
              and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that 
              collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement 
              applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>
            <p><b>Invite a Friend</b></p>
            <p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend 
              about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. 
              Talk City will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting 
              them to visit the site. Talk City stores this information for the 
              sole purpose of sending this one-time email.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Public Forums</b></p>
            <p>This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news 
              groups available to its users. Please remember that any information 
              that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and 
              you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal 
              information.</p>
            <p><b>Talk City Downloads</b></p>
            <p>From time to time, Talk City may include the automatic or mandatory 
              download of new products, applets, etc. to the user's computer at 
              the point of registration for various Talk City services. While 
              Talk City reserves the right to include these downloads, their maintenance, 
              and occasional upgrading, it will also provide users with the means 
              to uninstall and/or remove these downloads at their discretion. 
              All downloaded products will include an "uninstall" feature or will 
              be removable via the computer's "Add/Remove" program feature. </p>
            <p><b>Special Offers</b></p>
            <p>Talk City works with various third-party marketing and advertising 
              firms to bring special offers to the attention of its members. Such 
              offers are presented both at the time of Membership registration 
              and on an ongoing basis via email. Talk City does not share personally 
              identifiable information about its users to these third-party marketing 
              partners. It may, however, provide aggregate data about members 
              to allow marketers to target by certain demographic or interest/purchase 
              patterns. To learn more about our special offers marketing partners, 
              we encourage you to check out the privacy policies of these companies. 
              Please see your opt out choices below.</p>
            <p><b>Choice/Opt-Out</b></p>
            <p>You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' ' of having your information 
              used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point 
              where we ask for the information.</p>
            <p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional 
              materials from us may opt-out of receiving these communications 
              by going using the opt out link provided on the advertisement or 
              newsletter.</p>
            <p>If you have chosen to receive a product or service from one of 
              our advertisers or partners you must use their unsubscribe mechanism 
              to remove yourself from a product or subscription offering. Users 
              of our site are always notified when their information is being 
              collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make 
              an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services

            <p><b>Security:</b></p>
            <p>Talk City takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
              When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information 
              is protected both online and off-line.</p>
            <p>When our registration/subscription form asks users to enter sensitive 
              information (such as credit card number ), that information is used 
              and stored by entrusted third-party billing and payment clearing 
              houses such as Verisign.</p>
            <p>All of our users' information collected on Talk City services , 
              is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform 
              a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or an authorized 
              customer service representative) are granted access to personally 
              identifiable information. The servers that we store personally identifiable 
              information on are kept in a secure, locked environment.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you 
              can send an email to: <a href="mailto:info@delphiforums.com"> info@delphiforums.com</a></p>
