#### Credit Checks

When you apply to buy products and services from us we may carry out a credit check.  This means we may need to check certain records about you, these may include:

  * Our own;


  * records at CRAs.  Information on applications for our products and services will be sent to CRAs, when CRAs receive a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other organisations. They supply to us both public (including the electoral register) and shared credit and fraud prevention information. If you tell us about a spouse or financial associate, we will link your records together. CRA’s also link your records together, and these searches will be recorded by CRAs. We may disclose information about how you run your accounts to the CRA’s;


  * those at FPA’s. We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies; or


  * If you are a director of an organisation, we will seek confirmation, from credit reference agencies, that the residential address that you provide is the same as that shown on the restricted register of directors’ usual addresses at Companies House. 



It is important that you give us accurate information.  If you give us false or inaccurate data and we suspect fraud we will record this with the FPA’s.

#### Sharing Information

We will only share your information with organisations outside TalkTalk:

  * with your consent if we are using information for a purpose other than as set out in this Privacy Policy;

  * as part of current or future legal proceedings;

Where we share your information with third parties they are required to follow our express instructions in respect of the use of your personal information and they must comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Act or any other relevant legislation to protect your information and keep it secure.

From time to time these other people and organisations may be outside the European Economic Area in countries that do not always have the same standard of data protection laws as the UK.  However, we will have a contract in place to ensure that your information is adequately protected and we will remain bound by our obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998 (as amended from time to time) even when your personal information is processed outside Europe.

#### How Long Do We Hold Your Information

The time period for which we keep information varies according to what the information is used for. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep information, we will keep your information for as long as it is relevant and useful for the purpose for which it was collected (and which you agreed to).

For example, when you contact us we may monitor and record your communications with us to use this information for training and quality purposes, and to meet our legal and regulatory requirements. Where we record calls, these call recordings are only held for a limited period of time before we delete them permanently.

We will continue to hold information about you, if you do not become our customer, your application is declined, or even after you have closed your account or terminated your services with us.  We will only hold such information for such periods as is necessary for the purpose of dealing with enquiries, offering TalkTalk products and services you may be interested in, complying with any legal obligation and for crime and fraud prevention and detection.

The law requires us to keep certain information about how you use our services for a period of 12 months. This information may be used by certain law enforcement agencies to prevent and detect crime and to protect national security; we will only disclose this information to them when we are legally required to.
