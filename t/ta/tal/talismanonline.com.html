<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MiraGame</strong>(Miracle Castle Limited) is dedicated to   protecting the privacy rights of our users. This Privacy Policy   describes the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information   you provide in connection with our website at www.MiraGame.com or any   MiraGame’s game or application provided on other websites or other third   party sources. Please note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is   limited to information collected by MiraGame through your use of the   service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using the service, you are agreeing to the collection   and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may   update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are responsible for   periodically reading this Privacy Policy. If you use our service after   we have updated this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge that you have read   the updated terms and consent to our revised privacy practices. Use of   the service after changes are made to the Privacy Policy will be   considered your consent to the new terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected and Used</strong><br>
  MiraGame's   primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and   enhance the service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the   service. MiraGame may use user information to analyze user behavior in   MiraGame’s games. For example, MiraGame may analyze user information to   determine how often a user plays a particular game, if a user purchases   premium goods and other similar events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may collect both Personal and Non-Personal Information.   Personal Information is defined as information about you that can be   used to contact or identify you such as your name, email address, home   address, and phone number. Personal Information does not include   aggregate information, which is data we collect about the   characteristics and activities of users of the service, from which any   Personal Information has been removed. Non-Personal Information does not   identify you personally and can include age, gender or interests. We   may combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and use   this combination to improve your experience or to aggregate it with   information collected from other users to improve or analyze our   service. This privacy policy in no way limits or restricts our   collection of aggregate information or of Non-Personal Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You provide us information about yourself, such as your   name and e-mail address, if you register for a game account on our   website. When you visit our website, we may send one or more cookies - a   small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to   your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets MiraGame   help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A   cookie does not collect personal information about you.  A persistent   cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.   Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to   the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web   browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after   you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all   cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Your Personal Information</strong><br>
  MiraGame does not share your Personal Information except as approved by you or as described below:<br>
</p>
<ul style=" list-style-type: square; margin-left:40px;">
  <li>With your consent, for example, when you agree to our   sharing your information with other third parties for their own   marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;</li>
  <li>Agents and service Providers: MiraGame may engage other   companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf. Examples of   these services include sending postal mail and e-mail to you and   analyzing data. While these agents and service providers may have access   to your Personal Information in connection with the performance of   services for MiraGame, they may not use such information for any purpose   other than providing such services to MiraGame.</li>
  <li>Protection of MiraGame and Others: We may release   Personal Information when we believe that release is appropriate to   comply with the law; enforce or apply our rights; or protect the rights,   property, or safety of MiraGame our users, or others. This includes   exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud   protection.</li>
  <li>Corporate Transfers and Financings: MiraGame may share   your Personal Information in connection with any merger, sale of   MiraGame assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of   our business to another company.</li>
  <li>Aggregate Information: MiraGame may share aggregate   information about you and/or your customers with advertisers,   publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Links and Third Party Tools</strong><br>
  The service may contain links to other websites. The fact   that the service links to a website or presents a banner ad or other   type of advertisement does not mean that MiraGame endorses or authorizes   that third party, nor is it a representation of our affiliation with   that third party. MiraGame is in no way responsible for the privacy   policies of these other websites to which you chose to access from the   service. Please be sure to read the privacy policies of those websites   when exiting the service. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
  We have put in place reasonable technical and organizational   measures designed to secure your Personal Information from accidental   loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.   However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never   be able to overcome those measures or use your Personal Information for   improper purposes. Also please note that email and messaging systems are   not considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us Personal   Information through these mediums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>International Transfer</strong><br>
  We may transfer information that we collect about you,   including Personal Information, to affiliated entities, or to other   third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to   other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in   the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection   and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are   transferring information, including Personally Information, to a country   and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as   your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the   U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including   Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Policy Regarding Children</strong><br>
  The service is not geared toward children under the age of 14   and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children   under the age of 14. If we learn that a child under 14 has provided us   with Personal Information we will delete such information from our   files. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No Guarantees</strong><br>
  While this Privacy Policy states standards for maintenance of   data, and while efforts will be made to meet these standards, MiraGame   does not guarantee that it will comply with these standards. There may   be factors beyond our control that may result in disclosure of data.   Consequently, we offer no warranties or representations regarding the   maintenance or non-disclosure of data. </p>
