We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it.

If you are browsing the Website without registering with Talent Trove, you are anonymous to us, but we will collect the information listed below under Personal Information Collected Via Technology.

USE OF INFORMATION  
Any visitor of the Talent Trove website can view your profile information and photos that you have uploaded to the Talent Trove community. You can control what part of your profile information and photos is visible to visitors of the Talent Trove website and which network of Talent Trove members can see what information.

To provide you with some of the features that the Talent Trove community offers to its members, we may use Personal Information that is stored in your profile after you have requested such features, for example to send invitation e-mails to people that you specified as being interested in joining the Talent Trove community. In order to provide useful information about social networks to people who might be interested in joining the Talent Trove community, we may use your profile information and photos on the Talent Trove website, when we send emails, or when we send general newsletters to members of the Talent Trove community.

If you decide to use certain features of the Talent Trove network (like journals, blogs, groups, message boards and the like), some of the Personal Information you entered into your Talent Trove profile and any information, including Personal Information, that you enter using one of these features, might be used and displayed.

If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Talent Trove stores this information to send this one-time email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.

Talent Trove may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the Talent Trove service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience. Talent Trove members can use the search feature to search for other members by different criteria, like location or gender. The Personal Information that Talent Trove members enter into the Talent Trove profile will be used for these searches. Please be aware that any information that is publicly posted throughout the Talent Trove network can be accessed by every visitor of the Website.

Talent Trove may analyze any collected information for its own internal purposes. In addition, Talent Trove may remove personally identifying information from collected information to render it anonymous. Talent Trove may use Anonymous Information for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Information in its discretion.

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.

Talent Trove may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Website.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you and your Talent Trove account information is protected by a password that you select.
