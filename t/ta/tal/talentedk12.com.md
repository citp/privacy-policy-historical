Netchemia utilizes some of the most advanced technology for Internet security available today. When you access our site using current Internet web browsers, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects your information using both server authentication and data encryption, ensuring that your data is safe, secure, and available only to authorized Users in your organization. Your data will be completely inaccessible to others.

Netchemia provides each User in your organization with a unique user name and password that must be entered each time a User logs on. Netchemia issues a session "cookie" only to record encrypted authentication information for the duration of a specific session. The session "cookie" does not include either the username or password of the user. Netchemia does not use "cookies" to store other confidential user and session information, but instead implements more advanced   
security methods.

In addition, Netchemia is hosted in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.
