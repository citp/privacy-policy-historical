### Does Talent use Cookies?

A Cookie is a small file sent by Talent – like many other internet services do – to the user’s browser which is then stored on the user’s device in order to recognize the user when the user revisits our Service the next time. Such Cookie usually contains the name of the domain the Cookie originates from, the durability of the Cookie until it expires, and a value in terms of a unique number generated by a respective random generator. 

Using such Cookies enables Talent to recognize the user, and to statistically record the use of the service as well as analyze it in order to improve it. 

You can disable Talent’s cookies on your browser as further described below, and the website can be accessed with cookies disabled, but the Service may not be usable or its usability deteriorated without cookies. Cookies that are already on the device may be deleted by the user at any time, manually or doing so via the settings of the browser. We want to point out, however, that using the Service provided by Talent may possibly be limited or not as convenient without Cookies. 

### Does Talent use analytics tools?

Talent automatically records information, namely usage data. For advertising, market research, improvement of existing and creation of new innovative products, Talent may create aggregated anonymized data. 

Besides that, Talent uses Google Analytics to track the usage of the Service in order to optimize the Service for the users. All data is used in anonymized form. 

Google Analytics is a web analytics service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses so-called Cookies, text files, which are stored on the user’s device and which enable an analysis of the use of the Service by the user. By activating IP anonymization on the Service, the IP address of the user will however be shortened by Google within the member states of the European Union or other contracting states of the agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a server in the US and shortened there. Google will, on behalf of Talent, use the information to analyze the use of the Service by the user, in order to compile reports about the activities of users on the Service and in order to provide further services associated with the use of the Service and the internet. Google will in no way combine the IP address of a user with other data of Google. 

Users can prevent the installation of the cookies by a corresponding setting of the browser software; Talent however points out that in this case users can if applicable not use all functions of the Service of Talent in full. The users can object to the collection and use of their IP address by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here: [Opt-out (browser plugin)](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

Thereby, a cookie will be placed on your device. In case you delete your cookies, you will have to click the link again. 

Below you will find a list of the cookies we may use on our Service:

### Does Talent use Social Media Plug-ins?

On our Service we use elements from third parties including the social networks Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Xing and Whatsapp. Suppliers of the plug-ins are the companies Facebook Inc., LinkedIn Corporation and Twitter Inc, Xing SE and Whatsapp Ireland Limited or Whatsapp Inc.. Web page elements are e.g. buttons (so-called “social plug-ins”) or integrated content from the providers. 

Your browser establishes a direct connection to the server of the respective provider when you visit a page from our Service that contains such a website element. The content of the website element is transmitted by the respective provider directly to your browser and integrated into the Service. By integrating the website elements, the providers gain knowledge that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our Service, and even if you do not have a profile with the respective provider or are not logged in at the time. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to a server of the respective provider in the USA and stored there.

If you are logged into one of the services, the respective provider can directly assign the visit to Talent’s Service to your profile with this provider. 

We have no influence on the parameters of the data that the providers lift out with the help of the website elements. For details on the purpose and extent of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the providers as well as your related rights and setting options for protecting your privacy, please refer to the privacy policy of the provider. 

You would need to log out of each provider’s services if you want to prevent providers from directly associating the data collected through Talent’s Service with your profile in that service. Finally, there is the possibility of completely preventing the loading of the website elements with browser add-ons.
