	<p>
		Talentnow has created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to protect
		your personal information and educating you on how we use it. This policy applies
		to activities in which you engage, and data collected, on Talentnow ("Talentnow"
		or "Talentnow.com") or through email campaigns performed on our customers’ behalf
		(collectively, the "Site") but does not apply to any other Website or offline point
		of contact between Talentnow, or any other company, and consumers. Please review
		this policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time. Each time you visit
		Talentnow or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices
		described in this policy at that time.</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">
		Information Collected</p>
	<p>
		Your Personally Identifiable Information Collected by Talentnow:</p>
	<p>
		During our user sign up process we collect certain information such as your name,
		email, address etc. This information can be personally identifiable. You may always
		choose not to provide such Personally Identifiable Information; however, this may
		limit our ability to provide you with certain functionality on Talentnow.</p>
	<p>
		We may also collect demographic and other data, which may include Personally Identifiable
		Information. This information is provided by you, and you may always choose not
		to provide information about yourself.</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">
		Profile</p>
	<p>
		If you create your profile on Talentnow, you will be required to provide us with
		personally identifiable information. You will also enter other professional information
		such as your skill, experience, education which will allow others to search for
		professionals like you. On Talentnow, by default, your profile will be public and
		registered users of Talentnow will be able to search your profile. We reserve the
		right to use your profile in whole or in parts in media, publications online or
		offline.</p>
	<p>
		Talentnow also provides functionality for you to hide your contact information such
		as Name, Email and Phone.</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">
		Personally Identifiable Information Collected by Talentnow's Business Partners</p>
	<p>
		Talentnow works with employers, third-party advertising companies, sponsors and
		other companies with whom we do business ("Business Partners") to place advertising
		on our site and in email communications sent to our registered users and to recipients
		of job opportunities, search alerts, and other communications related to the Talentnow
		Service. Information about your visit to this site, such as number of times you
		have viewed an ad, may be used to serve advertising to you.</p>
	<p>
		- Talentnow may correlate or match registered user information, including Personally
		Identifiable Information, with information held by our Business Partners to target
		ads or otherwise improve the effectiveness of our service. Our Business Partners
		may read or set cookies on your hard drive, use pixel tags, track which ads you
		have viewed, or collect other information about you.</p>
	<p>
		- From time to time, Talentnow may also have special offers that are sponsored by
		a Business Partner. In order to participate in these offers, you may be required
		to follow a separate registration process. If you consent to receive information
		from a Business Partner, through an opt-out process, Talentnow may pass your information
		to such Business Partners.</p>
	<p>
		- Talentnow may also offer goods or services for purchase available by our Business
		Partners. If you purchase goods or services offered through Talentnow by a Business
		Partner, then you may be required to submit Personally Identifiable Information
		in order to complete the transaction and Talentnow may provide your Personally Identifiable
		Information to such Business Partner for that purpose.</p>
	<p>
		- In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship with a Business Partner
		in which we prominently display their brand name or trademarks on pages that appear
		the same as or very similar to the pages of the Talentnow service. These pages are
		known as "Co-Branded Pages" and these particular Business Partners are known as
		"Co-Branded Business Partners."</p>
	<p>
		- If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed
		by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share your personal information
		with the associated Co-Branded Business Partner. Co-Branded Business Partners may
		use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. Talentnow
		disclaims all liability for the privacy policies and procedures on any Business
		Partner or Co-Branded Business Partner Web site.</p>
	<p>
		- You will need to contact the Co-Branded Business Partner to instruct them directly
		regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally,
		you agree that Talentnow may use and disclose all such information so submitted
		to such Co-Branded Business Partners in the same manner in which we are entitled
		to use and disclose any other information you submit to us (see Use of Personally
		Identifiable Information by Business Partners below).</p>
	<p>
		Cookies : Talentnow wants to optimize your experience by ensuring that the most
		relevant information, searches and offers are displayed to you while using the Talentnow
		web site. A common manner in which to do this is by placing cookies on your computer.
		Cookies are strings of text and numbers that can identify your computer to us when
		you visit our site, and which may be correlated with your Personally Identifiable
		Information in our log files.</p>
	<p>
		IPAddress: We log standard information such as your IP address along with the URL
		from which you came to our site and the URLs visited on our site, which may or may
		not contain some Personally Identifiable Information. When we send messages to you
		or others, we may provide a URL link to the Talentnow site that contains an alphanumeric
		identifier, which allows us to identify the person to whom we sent the message so
		that we can personalize our content for that individual.</p>
	<p>
		PixelTags: Talentnow uses pixel tags to gather information about the emails we send
		to our registered users and to recipients of messages. Pixel tags are tiny graphic
		files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in our HTML-encoded email
		messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable email program, the recipient's
		computer will access our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, allowing us to record
		and store, along with your email address, the date and time the recipient viewed
		the invite or reminder, that the recipient's email program is capable of receiving
		HTML-encoded email, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may
		see or read cookies. For more information about cookies and how to disable their
		use, see the section below on "Use of Cookies."</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">
		Use of Information</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">

		contact you in connection with your transactions, postings and other activities
		on the site, to forward to you messages from other Users, to communicate with you
		about Job opportunities of interest to you and to operate the Talentnow service.</p>

		- These types of communications may contain commercial messages, such as banner
		ads and special offers. Each communication we send to you, other than communications
		sent to you for the sole purpose of addressing a technical or operational issue
		regarding the Talentnow service, will give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
		further such communications from us.</p>
	<p>
		- Use of our invitation service to tell a friend about our site or a job opportunity,
		or to participate in a referral chain, requires that you enter your friend’s email
		address. We will automatically send your friend email inviting him or her to visit
		the site or view the opportunity. Talentnow stores this information to send this
		email, to register a friend connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track
		the success of the Talentnow referral program. Your friend may contact us at Talentnow
		to request that we remove this information from view in our active database (Please
		use Talentnow Privacy in the subject line).</p>

		- Talentnow uses your Personally Identifiable Information to help us provide you
		with personalized content, advertising, and commercial messages (collectively, "Content").</p>

		Information" you give to us with any Business Partner without your consent, which
		may be obtained through an opt-in request (see Use of Personally Identifiable Information
		by Business Partners below), unless required by law, court order or as required
		to technically operate the service, or to complete a transaction or order.</p>
	<p>
		- Talentnow does reserve the right to share your Personally Identifiable Information
		with its parent, subsidiary or affiliated entities ("affiliated entities" are those
		companies owned or controlled by Talentnow's parent company).</p>

		or participation in a referral chain, requires that you enter your friend’s email
		address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or
		her to visit the site or view the opportunity. Talentnow stores this information
		to send this one-time email, to register a friend connection if your invitation
		is accepted, and to track the success of the Talentnow referral program. Your friend
		may contact us at Talentnow to request that we remove this information from view
		in our active database (Please use Talentnow Privacy in the subject line).</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">
		Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information by Talentnow's Business Partners:</p>
	<p>
		Contracted employers using Talentnow to send their jobs to you may receive your
		contact information (name and email address) from another user on Talentnow, from
		one of their employees participating in a Talentnow referral campaign, or by using
		other means outside the context of Talentnow, such as their own database of resumes
		or a third party database. In all cases, the employer using Talentnow to contact
		you is subject to this Privacy Commitment. And, you may at any time choose to opt
		out of receiving further communication from Talentnow. However, even if Talentnow
		blocks further use of your contact information, Talentnow cannot prevent employers
		who have obtained your name and email address independently from Talentnow from
		contacting you directly. Talentnow recommends contacting the employer directly if
		you wish to opt-out of further communication. * In order to provide other offers
		of particular interest to you, Talentnow may share demographic, geographic, and
		other Personally Identifiable Information with its Business Partners with your explicit
		consent (opt-in).</p>

		services or advertising through our site are not covered by this privacy commitment.

		practices. If you wish to prevent those companies from setting cookies on your browser,

		this site may affect your ability to use this site.</p>

		Talentnow may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information or the contents
		of your private communications if required to do so by law or court order. Your
