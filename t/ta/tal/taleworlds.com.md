The Data Protection Officer of TaleWorlds may be contacted at privacy@taleworlds.com.

### 3\. General information on our data processing

We process Personal Data only when necessary for the performance of a contract with you, when processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation we are subject to, or based on our legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of you which require the protection of your Personal Data. This section applies to all detailed processing activities listed below.

#### 3.1 Information Security

We and our employees understand the need for user privacy, and we maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. Access to user data is strictly limited to specific individuals who are trained to respect user privacy. The access given to these employees is restricted to their need for such information for business purposes. A log of those who accessed the data is maintained and monitored to prevent security breaches.

#### 3.2 Third-party information storage

We may share Personal Data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. For example, we may hire companies to assist with protecting and securing our systems or services. Any vendor or agent that we retain must comply with our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use Personal Data they receive from us for any other purpose. Like us, they will never barter, trade, or sell access to your Personal Data. We remain responsible and liable under data protection laws if third-party agents we engage to process Personal Data on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the applicable data protection laws, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

#### 3.3 Children

We recognise that we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. We will not knowingly collect personal information from any child, or process such information, without parental consent. For the purpose of this Policy, a child means any individual who is under the age of 16 (or the minimum legal age to consent to the collection and processing of personal information where this is different under applicable law).

#### 3.4 Retention periods

We will retain your Personal Data only as long as it is necessary to fulfil the respective purpose, unless we are required by law to store your Personal Data longer.

#### 3.5 Automated Decision-Making

We do not use automated-decision making, including profiling.

### 4\. Use of our Site

On our Site, we gather information either directly from you (e.g., when you provide certain information to us) or indirectly (e.g., through our Site’s technology).

#### 4.1. Information collected indirectly

We indirectly collect a variety of information through your interaction with and use of our Sites. This information may include, but is not limited to, browser settings, data collected through automated electronic interactions, application usage data, demographic information, geographic or geo-location information, statistical and aggregated information (“Other Information”). The processing is necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, as we need this information to keep user data safe by detecting certain threats, and to provide you with the best possible experience.

Statistical or aggregated information does not directly identify a specific person, but it may be derived from Personal Data. For example, we may aggregate Personal Data to calculate the percentage of users in a particular country.

If we combine Other Information with Personal Data, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data.

##### 4.1.1 Tracking Data

Website traffic volume and patterns, such as the number of visitors to a given website or page on a daily basis is typically referred to as “Tracking Data”. This type of indirectly collected information is gathered through various means, such as an IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that “serve up” web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you visit any of our Sites, our servers log your computer’s IP address.

To obtain these Tracking Data, we use third party analytics providers. The Third Party Analytics Providers use “Cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help us analyse how users use our Sites. The information generated by the Cookie about your use of our Sites, including your IP address, will be transmitted to and stored by Third Party Analytics Providers’ servers. On our behalf, the Third Party Analytics Providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Sites, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services relating to website activity. The Third Party Analytics Providers will not associate your IP address with any other data held by them.

You may find information on our Third Party Analytics Provider in section 8 below and a list of Cookies used by them in section 9 below.

##### 4.1.2 Our Cookies

You may adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of Cookies, or to provide notification whenever a Cookie is sent to you. You may refuse the use of Cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to access the full functionality of our Sites. Cookies placed by us will expire when you terminate the website session or after a reasonable period of inactivity.

##### 4.1.3 Third-party Cookies

Additionally, we may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may use Cookies and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. You can still decide whether you want to accept these Cookies. You may adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of third-party Cookies, or to provide notification whenever such third-party Cookies are sent to you. We use the following third-party Cookies:

You may find a list of Cookies used in section 9 below.

#### 4.2. Information collected directly

We also collect Personal Data and other information that you voluntarily provide. It is entirely your decision to provide the requested information. However, certain features of our Sites may not be available in this case.

We keep all information collected directly confidential, and will only use the information for the particular purpose it is collected for. We will seek your specific permission for any additional use. We will never barter, trade, or sell access to your information without your specific consent.

##### 4.2.1 User Accounts

When setting up an account on one of our Sites (“User Account”), you may be asked to provide Personal Data including, but not limited to, your name, email address, and your phone number. If you choose to purchase any products, services, access codes or other items for sale by us, you will be asked to provide payment details and your full address for billing purposes.

As a user of our Sites, we may obtain your Personal Data when you register to use our Site or services and products or when you provide feedback about our products or services. The processing is necessary to perform the contract with you according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. As a user, we will use your Personal Data, unless otherwise prohibited by law, for the following purposes:

To provide you with the products and services you request.

To communicate with you about your account or transactions with us and send you information about features on our sites or changes to our policies.

To provide support including, but not limited to, product updates, product patches and fixes and other similar communications. 

Furthermore, we will use your Personal Data for our legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR to notify you about information about features on our Sites, new product releases and service developments and to advertise our products and services in accordance with this Policy.

Any User Account data will only be stored until you decide to terminate your User Account. In case we are obliged to further store your Personal Data due to statutory retention requirements, your Personal Data will be barred for further use by us and only stored until such retention periods expire.

##### 4.2.2 Personal Data provided by other means

Personal Data provided by you on our Sites by other means, e.g., via contact forms, will be stored in our service database and retained for the period necessary to fulfil the business our contractual obligations to you in accordance with Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR, unless a longer retention period is required by law.

This Personal Data is necessary for us to provide you with the Games and their full functionality. The legal basis for processing the data is our contract with you (Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR). Where the processing exceeds the necessity to fulfil our contract (when analysing how you use our game for the purpose of enhancing your game experience), the legal basis is our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR) to improve the Games for your future enjoyment.

For billing purposes, we process your name, your email and postal address and your credit or debit card number, depending on which payment you choose. The basis for the processing of this Personal Data is also our contract with you (Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR), and our legal requirement to store this information for tax reasons (Art. 6(1)(c) of the GDPR).

The provision of all of the Personal Data is a contractual requirement, as we may not provide you with our Games or to carry out any payments by you.

We transfer Personal Data for billing purposes to the USA. This transfer is safeguarded by Data Processing Agreements with data protection guarantees and the EU-US Privacy Shield, as the recipients are certified under this framework.
