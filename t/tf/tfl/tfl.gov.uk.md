# Privacy & cookies - Transport for London

We are committed to protecting your personal information when you use TfL services. In this section we explain how we ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. 

We sometimes need to collect your personal information so that we can provide you with the full range of our services, operate London's transport network effectively and carry out our statutory functions. Here, we outline our obligations and your rights under the data protection legislation, which regulates the use of personal information by all private and public sector organisations.

## Who we are and what we do

TfL is a statutory body created by the Greater London Authority (GLA) Act 1999. The GLA Act gives the Mayor of London a general duty to develop and apply policies to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services to, from and within London. This is known as the 'General Transport Duty'. The Mayor delegates this duty to TfL to carry out on their behalf, together with the implementation of the Mayor's Transport Strategy.

## Why we handle personal information

Under data protection legislation, TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so. In most cases, our handling of your personal information will be necessary for the delivery of the Mayor's Transport Strategy and the statutory functions described above.

Depending on the TfL product or service you use or sign up for, there may be another legal basis that makes the handling of your personal information lawful. You should refer to the menu of privacy pages on this page for more information.

We don't share your personal information with any third parties unless they are providing services to us under contract or disclosure is permitted by, or required by, law. Please refer to the menu of privacy pages on this page for more information.

## Third-party sites

Our website contains links to sites owned and operated by third parties. They have their own privacy policies, and we urge you to review them before browsing those sites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third-party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

## Protecting your personal information

Your privacy is very important to TfL, and we take all necessary measures to ensure your personal information is properly protected and secured. This includes having appropriate technical and organisational arrangements to secure your information. TfL will never send an unsolicited message asking you to provide your password, financial details or other sensitive information by email or through a link.
