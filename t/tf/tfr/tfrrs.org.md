# TFRRS | Track & Field Results Reporting System

  
We are committed to safeguarding the online privacy of our users, and recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information collected. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically. 

### COLLECTION OF INFORMATION 

  
Our site's registration form requests users to give us contact information (like your name, graduation year, etc.). Some of the requested information is required in order to receive the TFRRS service; other information is optional. The required information is clearly marked as such on the registration pages. TFRRS collects personal information on users primarily for the administrative uses of coaches and administrators. Only authorized administrators and a user's current coach may view personal information submitted by a user within the site. 

  
We do not share any of your information with third parties without your permission. We may provide you with opportunities to receive information about additional products and services, but we will never share your information with third parties unless you grant us permission to do so. If you grant us permission to share your information with third parties, and then change your mind, you may revoke your permission at any time by going to your profile in Setup within your account. 

### SUBSCRIBER SERVICES AND REGISTRATION DATA 

  
In order to access certain Subscriber Services within the site, you may be asked to provide Registration Data through an online registration form. You will then be supplied with a "username" and "password." The information collected may include your legal name, address, telephone number, email address, subscriber name or areas of interest, and/or password used to access Subscriber Services. TFRRS reserves the right to request any additional information necessary to establish and maintain your account for use of the Subscriber Services. 

  
Registration Data is in part the property of TFRRS and DirectAthletics, Inc.. In some instances, TFRRS may use your Registration Data on an aggregate (i.e., group) basis, where we will not know or keep track of individual information. 

  
Use of the TFRRS site is conditioned on your provision of requested information in an accurate and truthful fashion. If you choose not to provide such information, you may not be able to access some or all of the site. Although TFRRS will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of the Registration Data, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be secure. TFRRS has no liability for disclosure of Registration Data due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties. 

### ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION 

  
TFRRS may display limited information about athlete users within its site. This information includes team affiliation and graduation year, as well as any publicly-available athletic results. This information may be viewed by all users in the site. 

  
Only coaches and administrators who represent teams or leagues with which an athlete is affiliated may view additional information including, but not limited to, address, phone number, email address, TFRRS ID and birthday. 

  
Medical information is distributed only as needed to authorized administrators. Under no circumstances will any medical information be disclosed to parties other than authorized athletic administrators.
