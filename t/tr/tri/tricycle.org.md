**Scope.**

Our Privacy Policy covers all of Tricycle.com and the following content and brands:  Tricycle: The Buddhist Review; Tricycle Magazine; The Tricycle Community; Tricycle Retreats; and Tricycle Gallery and other related properties owned or controlled by Tricycle.  Our Privacy Policy does not apply to entities not owned or controlled by us, such as third-party applications and/or other web sites.

**Information Covered.**

The Privacy Policy covers information users provide to us, including, but not limited to, name, email address, physical address, phone number, other personal information, content of messages and comments, and transactional information, including but not limited to, credit card and billing data.  Information collected from users may include their site activity, access device, browser type, their location, IP address, pages visited,  cookies, and other similar information.

**How Tricycle.com Uses Information.**

We use the Information Covered to manage services provided by us or our licensees or affiliates, such as contacting users and for advertising and marketing purposes. We may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties.  We keep such information for only as long as needed for business operations and legal compliance.

**How Tricycle.com Shares the Information Covered.**

Tricycle.com may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) required from jurisdictions inside or outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required under local laws of that jurisdiction, applies to users from that jurisdiction, and is consistent with generally accepted international standards.  We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Terms of Service.  This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.

**How Tricyle.com Protects the Information Covered.**

We take many steps to keep your information secure.   All account information is stored on secured servers behind firewalls.  Sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and passwords), is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  Despite our best efforts, there are risks inherent in sharing information. We cannot control actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information.  We cannot ensure that information you share will not become publicly available.  We are not responsible for third party circumvention of privacy settings or security measures.

To further protect your information, you can reduce your risk by using security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up-to-date antivirus software. Also, you can report any security violations to us at [support@tricycle.com](mailto:support@tricycle.com). 

We also respect minors’ privacy. Tricycle.com is intended for adults. Children under age 13 are not permitted to join this site.  We also recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information.

By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules such as on a winners list.
