# Privacy | Triplelift

### What does this privacy policy cover?

TripleLift values your privacy. We intend for this document to clearly detail the principles of our technology solutions and the data we collect through our technologies and through our website. This privacy policy currently covers cookies belonging to TripleLift’s advertising domains (including adpinr.com, betrpin.com, and 3lift.com), as well as to triplelift.com.

### What does TripleLift know about me?

TripleLift works with advertisers and publishers. Our aim is to deliver more engaging, interactive content. The advertising domains sometimes deliver cookies with an advertisement, and publisher solutions sometime deliver cookies upon certain engagement points. We do not know who you are. We don’t even have room in our database to store who you are. This means we don’t know your name, your profession, your IQ, your cat’s name, who you crushed on in 6th grade or anything like that. We may know if you’ve seen one of our ads, if you’ve clicked on them or ended up purchasing something as part of clicking on the advertisement – but this information is completely anonymous. That said, if you buy something from a site we work with, we do not and cannot tie back the information from the purchase (your name, your address, your credit card information) to you – we never and cannot get this personal information. That stays with the advertiser or publisher.

We do not collect personally identifiable information. All cookie data is anonymous and no effort is taken to tie this information to names, birthdates, usernames of any sort, etc.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are actually text files that live on the user’s computer. Each browser has its own set of cookies, and uses them for record-keeping. We use cookies on our triplelift.com website, but these do not get intermingled with any of our other cookies. So anything that may be personally identifiable to you from this website (ie if you submit an inquiry and provide your name and email) will not be tied back to you from an advertising perspective. You can remove all of our cookies by following the directions in your browser.

### Opting Out

It is currently not possible to opt out. If you are concerned about information tied to your cookie, please delete cookies relating to the domains adpinr.com, betrpin.com, 3lift.com and triplelift.com. You may block cookies from our domains by following the directions in your browser.

### TripleLift Privacy Policy

We do not share, rent, lease, etc. your personally identifiable information with third parties other than as disclosed in this policy.

We will disclose information to the extent that we are required to do so by applicable laws.

### Third Party Cookies

Third-party cookies are not covered by this privacy statement. We do not have any control over the policies of third parties, but we do not intermingle our data with theirs.

### Changes to this Privacy Statement

We reserve the right to make changes to our privacy policy, but we will always post the newest version of our privacy policy on our website and any other place that is appropriate.
