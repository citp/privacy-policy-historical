  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Privacy policy</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Triptease is an online community website (the “Site” or "Triptease") and a corresponding application for mobile devices
    (the "Application") that allows you to discover gear and places related to your hobbies and passions.  Triptease users
    can view each other' profiles, share opinions about their favorite products and locations, ask and answer questions,
    share photos and videos, post comments, and describe their interests and experience.  To enrich our members' experience,
    we request and display personal information to other members and visitors, which allows our users to identify each other
    and expand their network of friends and followers.  Triptease members create their profiles, and have the ability to
    change their profile information at any time.  Triptease cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions
    concerning this Privacy Policy or about Triptease’s views on Privacy with regard to our Products and Services, please
    email us at privacy[at]triptease.com. Triptease collects personal information to improve the manner by which we operate
    and offer our products and services, communicate with you about those products and services, and provide effective,
    timely customer support when needed. We will never rent or sell any personally-identifiable information we collect from
    you to third parties, and will not share your personally identifiable information with third parties without your consent,
    other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy or unless such sharing is necessary for the purposes set forth in this
    Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site. This Privacy Policy may be
    updated from time to time.&nbsp; We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site.
    You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms
    used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Triptease Terms of Service <a href="/pages/terms_of_use">www.triptease.comf/pages/terms_of_use</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Information Collection and Use</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and
    content, to administer your Membership (together, the “Service”) and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Personally Identifiable Information.</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    When you register with us through the Site or Application to become a Triptease Member, we will ask you for personally
    identifiable information.  This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal
    Information”).  Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, websites and email address. You can
    register to join Triptease via the Site or Application or by logging into your account with certain third party social
    networking sites (“SNS”) (including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter) via our Site. If you decide to create your
    Account by logging into a SNS via the Site, we will extract the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such
    as your “real” name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) from the account you
    have with such SNS and use that information to create your Account; the information we extract may depend on the privacy
    settings you have with the SNS. For example, our Service allows users to create an account and login to the Service using
    their Facebook account credentials through Facebook Open Graph. If you are not currently registered as a Member and you click
    on “Sign in with Facebook,” you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to
    register and join Triptease. By using Facebook Open Graph,you are allowing Triptease to access your Facebook account
    information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use regarding your use of the Service via Facebook.
  </p>

  <ul>                                                                          l
    <li> We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.</li>
    <li> We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and
      personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences)
      (“Non-Identifying Information”). </li>
    <li> We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to
      provide the Service, and administer your inquiries.</li>
    <li> Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined
      with other identifiers (for example,&nbsp;combining your zip code with your street address)&nbsp;in a way that enables you to
      be identified.  But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken
      alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example,&nbsp;your viewing preferences).  We may combine
      your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other
      Triptease Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value
      of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used.  We may also use the combined
      information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to
      your preferences or restrictions.</li>
    <li> We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Triptease newsletters, marketing or promotional materials
      and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive
      such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or
      update your “user preferences” information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.) </li>
    <li> Log Data.  When you visit the Site, whether as a Triptease Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of
      these, a “Triptease User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit
      a website (“Log Data”).  This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
      browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the
      time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.
      We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical
      administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’
      needs.  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site again, it will recognize
      you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.  We also use this information to
      verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.  We do not treat Log Data
      as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze
      and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information. </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Cookies</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information.  We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize
    persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site.  Second, we utilize
    session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to
    monitor aggregate usage by Triptease Users and web traffic routing on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session
    cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser.  Third
    party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser.  You can instruct your browser,&nbsp;by changing
    its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before&nbsp;accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you
    do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Service.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Phishing</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Triptease.  Safeguarding information
    to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card
    information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail
    or telephone communication.  For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Triptease Members.</span>
    We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Site.
    Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want other Triptease Users to know about you.
    We recommend that you guard your sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what
    information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile information
    at any time.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</span>
    We may share aggregated information that does not include
    Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for
    industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will
    not contain your Personal Information.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Providers.</span>
    We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide
    the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database
    management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service
    are used.  These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and
    are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to our business
    partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe
    will be of interest to you.  You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</span>
    Triptease cooperates with government and law enforcement officials
    and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.  We will disclose any information about you to government or
    law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond
    to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Triptease
    or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider
    to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfers.</span>
    Triptease may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your
    Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of
    bankruptcy.  Triptease will notify you before transferring your information to a new entity as part of a merger,
    acquisition, reorganization or sale of some or all of its assets&nbsp;if the new entity's processing&nbsp;of your information will
    materially differ from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facebook Open Graph and Twitter API.</span>
    We allow users to automatically post recent activity to Facebook or Twitter,
    and give them the option to disable Facebook Open Graph and Twitter API at any time by logging into their profile and
    selecting the option to disable Facebook Open Graph or Twitter API. Further, you may be able to edit your privacy settings
    for the content that you post which appears on Facebook by making selections in your account settings via the
    Site and Application.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    All Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile  through 'edit'
    option in the Profile section.  If you completely delete all such information, then your account may become deactivated.
    If you would like us to delete your record in our system, please contact us at privacy[at]triptease.com with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database.
    We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request.
    We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Security</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Triptease is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable physical, technological, and
    administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances.&nbsp; No method of
    transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.&nbsp;Therefore, while we strive
    to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your
    unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification)
    to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay,
    insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the
    scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>International Transfer</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country
    or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If
    you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Triptease transfers Personal Information
    to the United States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such
    information represents your agreement to that transfer.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Triptease is not "Error-Free"</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    We sometimes release beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release to you of the "final"
    versions. Because these products may still be in a testing phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue,
    despite our best efforts to do so (we do care about privacy!). As such, we welcome comments on any privacy concerns you
    may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. Triptease does not guarantee error-free
    performance under this Privacy Policy. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and will take
    prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our Privacy Policy. Triptease shall not be liable
    for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy shall be
    governed by the laws of the United Kingdom.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Third-Party Advertising</h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Our Site contains ads with links to other websites.  If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner
    ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website.
    The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization
    or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information
    security policies or practices.  We do not exercise control over third party websites.  These other websites may place
    their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  Other sites
    follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We encourage you
    to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Our Policy Toward Children </h3></div>

  <p class="paragraph">
    This Site is not directed to children under 13.  We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
    children under 13.   If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information
    without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy[at]triptease.com.  If we become aware that a child under 13
    has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
  </p>

  <div class="header-bottom-line"><h3>Contacting Us</h3></div>
