            <h3>4 The collection of personally identifiable information when visiting our website</h3>
            <p>
If you are only using the website for informational purposes, i.e., if you do not enroll or otherwise provide us with information, we will only collect the personally identifiable information that your browser transmits to our server. If you wish to view our website, we collect the following data that is technically necessary for us to display our website and ensure its stability and security. Only in the case of suspected misuse in connection with bookings would we use this link information to facilitate the identification of the person responsible. The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR:
            </p>
            <p>
–IP address, date and time of the inquiry, time difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), content of the request (concrete page), access status/HTTP status code, amount of data transferred in each case, website that receives the request, browser, operating system and its interface, language, and browser software version.

            <h3>5 Contact by e-mail or contact form</h3>
            <p>
When you contact us by e-mail or through a contact form, we will store the data you provide (your e-mail address, possibly your name and telephone number) so we can answer your questions. Insofar as we use our contact form to request entries that are not required for contacting you, we have always marked these as optional. This information serves to substantiate your inquiry and improve the handling of your request. A statement of this information is expressly provided on a voluntary basis and with your consent, art. 6 par. 1a GDPR. As far as this concerns information about communication channels (such as your e-mail address or telephone number), you also agree that we may also, where appropriate, contact you via this communication channel to answer your request. You may of course revoke this consent for the future at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
We delete the data that arises in this context after saving is no longer required, or limit processing if there are statutory retention requirements.

            <h3>6 Newsletter</h3>
            <section>
            <h4>6.1 General information</h4>
                <p>
With your consent under Art. 6 par. 1 a GDPR, you can opt in to our newsletter, which will inform you about our current deals. <br>
To sign up for our newsletter, we use the “double opt-in” method. This means that after you have signed up, we will send you an e-mail to the e-mail address specified, in which we ask you to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm your sign-up within [24 hours], your information will be locked and automatically deleted after one month.
                </p>
                <p>
In addition, we save the IP addresses you used and the times of sign-up and confirmation. The purpose of the procedure is to verify your sign-up and, if necessary, to inform you about possible misuse of your personal data.
                </p>
                <p>
The only requirement for sending the newsletter is your email address. The specification of additional, separately marked data is voluntary and will be used to address you personally. After your confirmation, we will save your e-mail address for the purpose of sending you the newsletter. The legal basis is art. 6 par. 1 a GDPR.
                </p>
                <p>
You may revoke your consent to the sending of the newsletter at any time and opt out of the newsletter. You can declare the revocation by clicking the link provided in each newsletter e-mail or by contacting the aforementioned data protection officer.
                </p>

            <section>
            <h4>6.2 Newsletter Tracking</h4>
                <p>
Please note that we evaluate your user behavior when sending the newsletter. For this evaluation, the emails sent include “web beacons” or tracking pixels, which are stored on our website. For the evaluations, we link the data mentioned and the web beacons with your e-mail address and an individual ID.
                </p>
                <p>
With the data obtained in this way, we generate a user profile to tailor the newsletter to your individual interests. In doing so, we record when you read our newsletters, which links you click on in them and deduce your personal interests. We link this data with actions you have taken on our website.
                </p>
                <p>
You can object to this tracking at any time by clicking on the separate link provided in each e-mail. The information will be saved as long as you have opted in to the newsletter. After you log out, we save the data purely statistically and anonymously.
                </p>
                <p>
Also, such tracking is not possible if you've deactivated image viewing by default in your e-mail application. In this case, the newsletter will not be displayed in full and you won’t be able to use all the features. If you display images manually, the above tracking will take place.
                </p>

            <h3>9 Use of social plug-ins</h3>
            <p>
This website uses the provider’s social plug-ins
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Facebook, Instagram (operator: Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA)</li>

                <li>-Twitter (operator: Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA)</li>
                <li>-LinkedIn (LinkedIn Corporation1000 W. Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA) </li>
                <li>- Pinterest (operator: Pinterest Inc., 635 High Street, Palo Alto, CA, 94301, USA) </li>
                <li>-Xing (XING SE, Dammtorstraße 30, 20354 Hamburg)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
These plug-ins typically collect data from you as standard, and transmit it to the respective vendor’s server. We have taken technical measures to ensure the protection of your privacy, which guarantee that your data cannot be collected by the vendors of the respective plug-ins without your consent. These will initially be deactivated when you visit a site connected to the plug-ins. The plug-ins will not be activated until you click on the respective symbol, and by doing so, you give your consent to have your data transmitted to the respective vendor. The legal basis for plug-in use is article 6, par. 1 a and f of the GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
Once activated, the plug-ins also collect personally identifiable information, such as your IP address, and send it to the respective vendor’s server, where it is saved.

            <h3>12 Analysis</h3>
            <p>
For the purposes of analyzing and optimizing our websites, we use different services that are described in the following. This allows us to analyze, for example, how many users visit our site, which information is requested the most, and how users find the website. The data that we collect includes the websites from which a person in question arrives at a website (“referrer”), which subpages on the website are accessed and how often, and the length of time for which a subpage is viewed. This helps us to develop and improve our website to be more user-friendly. The data collected does not serve to personally identify individual users. Anonymous or highly pseudonymous data will be collected. The legal basis for this is article 6, par. 1 f of the GDPR.
            </p>
            <section>
                <h4>12.1 Google Analytics</h4>
                <p>
This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). This use covers the Universal Analytics operating mode. This makes it possible to assign data, sessions, and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user’s activities across devices.
                </p>
                <p>
Google Analytics uses cookies that allow your use of the website to be analyzed. The information generated by the cookie through your use of this website is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. If IP anonymization is activated on this website, however, your IP address will be truncated in advance within the member states of the European Union or other contracting states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional circumstances will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. The IP address transmitted from your browser in the context of Google Analytics will not be conflated with other Google data. Google will use this information in this website operator’s order to evaluate your use of the website so that reports about website activity can be compiled and other services connected to website and internet use can be rendered for the website operator. Our legitimate interest in data processing is also for these purposes. The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is article 6, par. 1 f of the GDPR. The data sent by us and connected to cookies, user information (such as user ID), and promotional IDs are deleted after 14 months after the last use of our services. Data whose storage period has expired is automatically deleted once a month. More information on the terms and conditions of use and data protection can be found at <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/?hl=en</a>.

            <h3>13 Advertising</h3>
            <p>
We use cookies for marketing purposes to approach our users with advertising that is more tailored to their interests. We also use cookies to reduce the likelihood of ads playing and to measure the effectiveness of our advertising measures. This information may also be shared with third parties, such as ad networks. The legal basis for this is article 6, par. 1 a and f of the GDPR. The goals intended in data processing serve the legitimate interest of direct marketing. You are entitled to file an objection to the processing of your data for the purposes of such advertising at any time. We provide the following opt-out options for the respective services for this purpose. Alternatively, you can prevent cookies from being set in your browser and App settings.
            </p>
            <p>
We use Google AdSense, a service for integrating ads. Google AdSense uses cookies and web beacons (invisible graphics). These web beacons allow the analysis of information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The information generated by cookies and web beacons via the use of this website (including user IP addresses) and the distribution of ad formats is transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.

                <h4>13.1 Google AdWords and Conversion Tracking</h4>
                <p>
To draw attention to our services, we place Google AdWords display ads and, within this context, use Google conversion tracking for the purposes of personalized online ads based on interests and location. The option to anonymize IP addresses is controlled through Google Tag Manager, via an internal setting that is not visible in the source of this page. This internal setting is set so that the anonymization required by privacy laws covers IP addresses.
                </p>
                <p>
Ads are displayed based on search requests on websites in the <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1752334?hl=en">Google ad network</a>. We have the ability to combine our ads with certain search terms. With the use of cookies, we are able to place ads based on previous user visits to our website.
                </p>
                <p>
When a user clicks on an ad, Google places a cookie on the user’s device. For more information on the cookie technology used, please see Google’s statements on <a href="https://services.google.com/sitestats/en.html">website statistics</a> and their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">data privacy policy</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
With the use of this technology, Google, and we as their customer, receive the information that a user has clicked on an ad and was redirected to our websites. The information acquired this way is solely used for statistical analysis related to ad optimization. We do not receive any information that would allow us to personally identify a visitor. The statistics provided to us by Google include the total number of users who have clicked on one of our ads and, where applicable, whether they were redirected to a page on our website that has a conversation tag. These statistics allow us to track which search terms most often lead to our ads receiving clicks, and which ads lead to the user contacting us via the contact form.
<br>
If you do not want this, you can prevent the storage of the cookies required for this technology by, for example, using the settings in your browser or your App. Should you do so, your visit will not be incorporated into user statistics.
                </p>
                <p>
You also have the option to choose the types of Google ads or deactivate interest-based ads on Google through <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous?hl=en&amp;sig=ACi0TCieanLYmh5z6f0nAvdRR5C77eYP-0u7ANbEvIfPnHAGEbE_80av9bi62phgM3urdlD9BNgLLd2eAYbdr6i1EUuQB_siUg">ad settings</a>. Alternatively, you can deactivate third-party use of cookies by using the Network Advertising Initiative’s <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">opt-out tool</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
However, we and Google will still receive statistical information about how many users visit this site and when. If you do not want to be included in these statistics either, you can prevent this by using additional programs for your browser (such as the Ghostery add-on).

            <p>
Your data will not be transmitted to third parties as a general rule unless we are legally obligated to do so or the transfer of data is necessary for implementing the contractual relationship or you have given prior express consent to have your data transferred.
            </p>
            <p>
External service providers and affiliated companies, such as online payment vendors communication agents, will only receive your data to the extent necessary to process your request. In these cases, however, the extent of data transmitted is kept to the necessary minimum. If our service providers come into contact with your personally identifiable information, we will make sure that this complies with the regulations of data protection laws in the same way through the course of processing the order in accordance with article 28 of the GDPR.

            <p>
We emphasize processing your data within the EU/EEA. However, it may happen that we use service providers who process data outside the EU/EEA. In these cases, we make sure that a reasonable level of data protection is established with the recipient before transmitting your personally identifiable information. This means that a level of data protection is reached through EU standard contracts or an adequacy decision that is comparable to the standard within the EU.
