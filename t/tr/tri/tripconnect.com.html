			TripConnect is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy applies to activities in which you engage and data gathered on the TripConnect web site and does not apply to any other web site or offline contact or communication. This privacy policy may be modified from time to time. Each time you visit our site or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy at that time.  
			<p>
			</p><h3>Your IP Address</h3>
			We encourage you to register with us in order to take advantage of TripConnect's many personalization features. However, you may choose not to register and still have access to our site. If you do not register, then the information we collect from you is limited. Like most websites, we log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and track usage statistics. If you reached our site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, then we also log that information. This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users. All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not individual reports.  
			<p>
			</p><h3>Cookies</h3>
			Like most websites, our site uses cookies to keep track of your activity on the site and enhance your experience on the site. When you register, we also link our cookies to the personal information you submit in order to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password, and to save other personal information (see Information We Collect From You, below) so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the site or write a review. 
			<p>
			Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.  
			</p><p>
			If you wish to disable these cookies, most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our site.  
			</p><p>
			
			</p><h3>Information We Collect From You </h3>
			In order to operate the site and provide you with information on products and services that may be of interest to you, we may collect profile information when you register (i.e. information that could be used to contact you such as full name and email address), demographic information (e.g. zip code), public information such as user ratings and reviews and a user name from you. Please note that nowhere on our site do we knowingly collect profile information from children under the age of 13.  
			<p>
			
			</p><h3>Information Other Web Sites Collect From You</h3>
			On our site, we may place links to other web sites operated by other parties. You need to be aware that we do not control these other web sites or these other web sites' business practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other web sites.  Consequently, the operators of these other web sites may collect different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were collected on our site. We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.  
			<p>
			
			</p><h3>How We Use Personal Information</h3>
			We use your profile information to help us efficiently manage activities on our site, to contact you when necessary, and to send you information, offers and other promotional materials for TripConnect's or third parties' goods or services. We carefully select the information we send to you and attempt to send you offers that are of value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special promotional information. Our site provides you with the option of declining to receive offers from TripConnect and TripConnect Partners by "opting-out" of receiving this type of communication. 
			<p>
			We may share your profile information with our agents, representatives, contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support services. These parties are prohibited from using your profile information for any other purpose. Your profile information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy, of TripConnect. We may also disclose specific information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of TripConnect or other visitors to the Site.  We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
			</p><p>
			Please read the information below to learn how we may make some of your profile information accessible to the public via our site or via other means.  
			</p><p>
			
			</p><h3>How We Use Profile Information, Reviews, Ratings and User Names</h3>
			When you register on our site, you must enter a user name as well as your full name, email address, your zip code (US and Canadian residents) or the country in which you live. 
			<p>
			Your username, as well as the city and state or country in which you live will be displayed in reviews written by you along with the content of those reviews and the ratings you provide therein. You should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit in the text of a review can be read, collected, or used by other users of the site and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in your reviews.
			</p><p>
			Once you have registered, you may also choose to link to other registered users of the site by inviting them to link to you via forms provided on the site.  Your full name will only be displayed, in reviews and elsewhere on the site, to a) other users that you link directly to you (one degree of separation), b) users that are linked to a user you are linked to (two degrees of separation), c) users that belong to groups you choose to join. You may change how your name is displayed by visiting the <a href="myaccount.do">My Account</a> page. Also, your reviews may indicate to other users how you are linked to them if you are not directly linked to them.  
			</p><p>
			You will be given the chance to designate certain of your reviews as accessible only to people you link to and you will also be given the chance to restrict whether users can send you comments and questions about individual reviews. You may change some of these designations in the My Account section of our site or by editing your reviews. Your user name, as well as the city and state or country in which you live, along with your reviews and places indicated by you as places you have visited, may also appear on a User Profile section of the Site accessible to other users of the site. 
			</p><p>
			
			</p><h3>Personal Communications Between Members</h3>
			When you invite someone to link to you, whether that person is a member or not, you are sending a personal email from you to that person.  The email address you use to register on the site will be shown to the recipient of your email, and the recipient will be able to reply to you using your email address.  Similarly, if you send an email reply to the sender of an invitation rather than take an action suggested in the invitation (Sign in, register or accept the invitation), you will be sending a personal email from you to that person.  Your email address will be shown to the person you send the reply to.  
			<p>
			When you send a message to a user of the site, you are sending a personal email from you to that person.  The email address you use to register on the site will be shown to the recipient of your email, and the recipient will be able to reply to you using your email address.  Similarly, if you send an email reply to the sender of a message rather than reply using the web site interface on TripConnect, you will be sending a personal email from you to that person. 
			</p><p>
			
			</p><h3>Our Security Precautions, Location of Information</h3>
			We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
			<p>
			If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email to us at <a href="mailto:contact@tripconnect.com">contact@tripconnect.com</a>.
			</p><p>

			</p><h3>How You Can Access and Update Your Preferences and Personal Information</h3>
			You  may opt-out of certain communications and/or modify profile information you have provided to us, by clicking on the My Account link and updating your preferences and profile information.  If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication. .  Alternatively, you may email us at <a href="mailto:contact@tripconnect.com">contact@tripconnect.com</a> to have these changes made or to deactivate your account.  Please be aware the changes you make to your profile may take time to take affect on the public areas of the site.  
			<p>
			
			</p><h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3> 
			If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our site.  
			<p>
			If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, the practices of the Site, or your dealings with the Site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@tripconnect.com">contact@tripconnect.com</a>.  Alternatively, you can send us mail to:  TripConnect, Inc., 419 Lafayette Street, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10003.
