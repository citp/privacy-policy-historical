</p>

<a target="_blank" class="fRt stdMrg" rel="nofollow" border="0" href="http://clicktoverify.truste.com/pvr.php?page=validate&amp;url=www.tripit.com&amp;sealid=102 "><img src="/images/logos/truste_seal_ctv.gif" alt="Truste_seal_ctv"></a><br>

<p>
  The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that we use
  the information you provide to us or we gather from you while you
  use the tripit.com online service (the "Service"), as provided by
  TripIt, Inc. ("TripIt" or "us" or "we"), at www.tripit.com (the
  "Site"). It is our goal to provide you with information that is
  tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect
  your privacy.
</p>
<p>
  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of any part of
  the Service will constitute your agreement to this Privacy
  Policy. If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of this
  Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service. This Privacy Policy
  does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without
  limitation, offline or on sites linked to through the Service.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our
  <a href="/uhp/userAgreement">User Agreement</a>. Your use of
  the Service constitutes agreement to the User Agreement as well.
</p>
<p>
  If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
  privacy policy, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are
  aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
  circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
</p>
<p>
  If we decide to change our privacy policy in regards to how we
  utilize any personally identifiable information, we will post those
  changes on our homepage.
</p>
<p>
  We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so
  please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this
  policy or if we change our email practices, we will notify you here,
  by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
</p>
<p>
  TripIt is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  TRUSTe is an
  independent organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and
  confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information
  practices.  This privacy statement covers the Web site
  www.tripit.com.  Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its
  commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its
  information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for
  compliance by TRUSTe.
</p>
<p>
  If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you
  should first contact us at support@tripit.com.
  If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your
  inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact
  TRUSTe <a rel="nofollow" href="http://clicktoverify.truste.com/pvr.php?page=validate&amp;url=www.tripit.com&amp;sealid=102">here</a>.  TRUSTe will then serve as a
  liaison with us to resolve your concerns.
</p>

<h2>1. What Information We Collect from You</h2>
<br>
<p>
  When you register with TripIt, we ask for your email address and
  password and once registered allow you to provide us with your name,
  home location and up to three other email addresses in order to
  access your account as well as other information including your
  travel information, history and preferences. TripIt then uses this
  information to build personalized travel itineraries.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to upgrade your account with us, we request certain
  personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You
  must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing
  address, mobile phone number) and financial information (such as
  credit card number, expiration date).
</p>
<p>
  We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your
  orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this
  information to contact you.
</p>
<p>
  If you also select to have TripIt track your travel rewards points,
  TripIt will store account details for each of your travel rewards
  points accounts including each account’s login username and
  password.
</p>
<p>
  For all Site visitors, not just registered users, we collect
  information such as IP address, browser type, domain name, access
  times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat
  information, time stamp and exit page information.
</p>
<p>
  If you contact us, we also will collect the information you provide
  that details the nature of your question or problem to enhance the
  quality of our Service.
</p>

<u>Import Contacts</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  We utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with
  your contacts and other members of TripIt.  We make it easy for you
  to invite people from your email address books and contact lists to
  join you on our Site or to find people who have already joined our
  site. At your request we will search your email address book to help
  you import your contacts to our Site. We do not store your login
  information.  When you request that TripIt send an invitation email
  to your imported contacts, TripIt stores this contact information
  for the sole purpose of sending this invitation email. The email
  that is sent to your friend will come from your email address so
  that your friends know that you want to invite them to visit the
  site. TripIt does not store any passwords you provide as part of the
  contact import process.
</p>

<u>Facebook Connect</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  The TripIt Site allows users to access Facebook Connect to interact
  with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and friends' News
  Feeds. If you are already logged into TripIt and Facebook, when you
  click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to merge your
  profiles. If you are already logged into TripIt but not logged into
  Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be
  prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to "Sign up for
  Facebook." By proceeding, you are allowing the TripIt Site to access
  your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use
  in your use of TripIt Sites.
</p>
<p>
  Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a TripIt user and
  you click on "Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to
  enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to
  register and join TripIt. Once you register on the TripIt site and
  Connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent
  activity back to Facebook. You have the option to disable Facebook
  Connect at any time by logging into your account and going to
  settings, "About Me", “Linked Accounts” and then unselecting
  "Facebook" Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews
  that appear on Facebook or disconnect your TripIt activity stream by
  visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.
</p>

<u>Google ID</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  We allow you to use your Google ID in order to set up a TripIt
  account.  If you wish to use your Google account you are taken to
  the Google website to login to your account, this information is
  then shared back with TripIt for the sole purpose of setting up your
  account.
</p>

<u>My Travel Application on Linkedin</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  We allow you to share your travel information on Linkedin by
  installing the ‘My Travel’ application and then authorizing Linkedin
  to access your TripIt account.  Once the application is installed,
  you can invite your Linkedin connections to use the same
  application.
</p>

<u>Tell-A-Friend</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  If you choose to use our referral service to invite a friend by
  email to our site, we will ask you for your friend’s email address.
  We will automatically send your friend an invitation email inviting
  him or her to visit the site.  TripIt stores this information for
  the sole purpose of sending this invitation email and tracking the
  success of our referral program.
</p>
<p>
  Your friend may contact us at support@tripit.com to request that we
  remove this information from our database.
</p>

<u>AddThis</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  When you use AddThis to bookmark and share our products and site,
  you will be taken to a third party site and note that their privacy
  policy governs the collection and use of the information collected
  on those sites.  You may also send your friend a one time email
  inviting them to visit the site from the AddThis widget.  TripIt
  does not collect nor store that information for any reason.
</p>

<h2>2. What Organization Is Collecting the Information</h2>
<br>
<p>
  TripIt, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates and manages
  www.tripit.com. More information about us may be found at
  <a href="/uhp/aboutUs">About Us</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you use our job section of the site, although it is co-branded as
  TripIt, please be aware that the collection and use of the
  information you enter on this page is governed by the JobScore
  privacy policy.  JobScore shares this information back with TripIt
  for the sole purpose of determining your eligibility for the
  position in which you are applying.
</p>

<h2>3. How Your Information Is Protected</h2>
<br>
<p>
  We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that
  are designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the
  personally identifiable information and email addresses submitted to
  us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Current
  Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent
  unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use
  of information. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
  method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however.  Therefore,
  while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your
  personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>
<p>
  The security of your personal information is important to us.  When
  you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on our
  registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using
  secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>

<h2>4. When We May Share Your Information</h2>
<br>
<p>
  The information we gather is used to create and maintain your travel
  itineraries and your travel profile and, if you have elected to
  receive them, send you marketing messages on behalf of TripIt and
  our travel partners. We also use the information that we gather to
  target content on our Site to more closely match your interests and,
  if you have selected to receive email communication from us, target
  email marketing messages that are more appropriate to your needs.
</p>
<p>
  When you use the Service, the personal information you provide will
  be shared with the third parties you designate for access to such
  information including other web sites, your friends, relatives and
  business associates. Depending upon the type of access you grant to
  such third parties, they may also be permitted to edit the
  information you have provided to us and to designate others to
  access and edit such information. You may change your settings at
  any time as to who has access to your information by going to your
  account settings and then changing your publishing options.
</p>
<p>
  Certain portions of the information you provide to us also may be
  displayed in your public profile. As an essential element of the
  services we offer, most of the personal information you explicitly
  provide to us when you register or update your profile is displayed
  on your public profile. In order for your profile to be made public
  you must go to your profile settings and then profile visibility.
  By default your profile is not for public viewing. Once displayed on
  publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and
  used by others. We cannot control who reads your posting or what
  other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so it
  is very important that you do not put personally identifiable or
  other private information in your posts. Once you have posted
  information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and
  delete it on the Site, you will not be able to edit or delete such
  information cached, collected and stored elsewhere by others (e.g.,
  search engines).
</p>
<p>
  In general, most of your travel related information, such as
  upcoming destinations and travel statistics, is displayed only to
  other TripIt members to whom you have specifically connected as part
  of your TripIt network. You can change your privacy settings to
  designate which types of information are shared and with whom by
  visiting the <a href="https://www.tripit.com/account/edit/section/your_profile">Profile and Privacy</a> page.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, we may share your personal information as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or
    take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to
    protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of TripIt, our
    users or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our
    User Agreement.</li>
  <li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a
    divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the
    unlikely event of bankruptcy.</li>
  <li>With business firms contracted to provide specific services to
    us, such as a credit card processing company, email messaging
    providers, and SMS providers, in a manner consistent with this
    Privacy Policy. In situations such as this where your data is
    shared with a third-party firm, the firm will be contractually
    obligated to use your personal data only for the purpose for which
    our relationship with the firm exists. The firm will not have the
    right to share your data with other organizations or contact you
    outside the bounds of their contract with us.</li>
  <li>As required by law and when we believe that disclosure is
    necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial
    proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web
    site...To respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property,
    or safety of TripIt or others. This includes, but is not limited
    to, fraud, technical malfunctions or abuse of our network or
    systems. We also may provide user information to third parties for
    the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course
    of business.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  From time to time, we also may share general information about our
  Site and visitors such as the number of visitors, aggregate and
  non-personally identifiable demographic and travel data, etc., with
  our advertisers and partners.
</p>
<p>
  Other than as set out above, you will also have the choice to
  authorize third party websites and mobile applications to access
  your travel information as part of their service to you.  The reason
  for allowing this authorization is to make it easier for you to
  access your travel information on a mobile device and to more easily
  incorporate your travel information with your personal and
  professional calendars.  We will not share, sell, rent or trade your
  personal information with third parties other than as described
  within this privacy policy.
</p>

  inaccuracies in your account and change your email address,
  password, privacy settings, or contact information such as your name
  and billing address. If you cannot update your personal identifiable
  information on your own, we will respond to all access requests
  within 30 days. You may also subscribe or unsubscribe for certain
  communications from us as explained in more detail in Section 6
  below and in the User Agreement. Registration and login are required

<h2>7. Mobile Message Services You Choose to Receive from Us</h2>
<br>

  TripIt collects the mobile phone number you provide to send you SMS
  alerts regarding flight delays, gate changes, and other alert
  information specific to your itinerary.  You may opt-out of these
  mobile alerts at any time by following the opt-out instructions at
  the bottom of each SMS message.
</p>

<h2>8. Cookies</h2>
<br>
<p>
  A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a Web
  server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie lets a
  computer server identify your computer. A cookie is what allows many
  sites to greet you upon every return with a personalized message
  even before you actively login. We use cookies to improve your user
  experience and reduce the time it takes for you to create an
  itinerary. Our cookies do not include any personal information, but
  they do help us track which of our Web pages are visited and what
  services are most often used. You may choose not to receive a cookie
  file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you
  before accepting a cookie. Please be aware, however, that by
  refusing to accept cookies, you will be unable to access a
  significant portion of the Site and unable to use a significant
  portion of the Service.

<u>Third Party Cookies</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  Our privacy statement does not cover the use of cookies by our
  partners and service providers.  We do not have access or control
  over these cookies.  Our partners and service providers use session
  ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.
</p>

<u>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>
  Our third party advertising and analytics partner employ a software
  technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that
  help us better manage content on our site by informing us what
  content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique
  identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track
  the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which
  are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded
  invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the
  end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by
  clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>
  To learn more about our advertising company’s use of clear gifs,
  please go to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</a></p>

<h2>9. Third-Party Advertising</h2>
<br>
<p>
  From time to time, we may use a third-party advertising company to
  serve advertising on our behalf. Through the use of technology
  devices commonly referred to as cookies and action tags, this
  third-party ad-serving company can measure the effectiveness of our
  ads. We do not have access to the third-party server's cookies,
  which are similar to our own cookies. The third-party ad server
  employs an action tag (also known as a Web Beacon or a one-pixel
  .gif file) to set or read cookies. The third-party ad server may
  also receive specific information about your use of the Service and
  use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in
  order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest
  to you. Rest assured that this shared information is anonymous and
  does not contain any personally identifiable information, i.e. such
  information does not include your name, address, email address, or
  telephone number. You can find out more about third-party
  advertisers and explore the option of not having this information
  collected by clicking <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>10. Sweepstakes</h2>
<br>
<p>

  participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes. Information we
  collect for such a survey, contest or sweepstakes will be subject to
  the same protection as the information we generally collect from our
  users.
</p>

<h2>11. Testimonials, User Feedback and Blogs</h2>
<br>
<p>
  We often receive testimonials and comments from users who have had
  positive experiences with our Service. We occasionally publish such
  content. When we publish this content, we may identify our users by
  their first and last name and may also indicate their home city.  We
  do obtain the users consent prior to posting their name along with
  their testimonial.
</p>

<u>User Feedback</u>

<h2>12. Children</h2>
