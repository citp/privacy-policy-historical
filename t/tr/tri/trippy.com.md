Trippy, Inc. ("Trippy," "we," or "us") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Trippy when you use the Trippy Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/About_Trippy/Terms-of-Service.html). 

**Information We Collect**

**User-Provided Information:** You provide us information about yourself, such as your name, email, password, gender, and address, if you register for a Member account with the Service, including by "following," "becoming a fan," adding the Trippy application, etc., on a third party service such as Facebook. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, including the names of those individuals you chat with, as well as any information in User Content you post to the Service.

**Device Identifiers:** When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device and are used by Trippy to enhance your use of the Service. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Trippy. A device identifier may convey information about how you browse the Service to us. A device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. A device identifier may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute personally identifiable information. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. Trippy may access, collect and/or store device identifiers once you enable Trippy's Services on your mobile device. 

**Location Data:** When you utilize the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store "location data," which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey information about how you browse the Service to us. Location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. Location data may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute personally identifiable information. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

**Facebook Connect Information:** If you sign in to the Service through Facebook Connect, you authorize Facebook to provide Trippy with basic information such as your Facebook user ID, name, email, gender, birthday, current city, profile picture, networks, the Facebook user ID's of your friends who have also signed into the Service through Facebook Connect, and any other information you allowed to be shared with everyone (collectively the "Facebook Basic Information"). You may also give Trippy access to other information about you and your contacts from Facebook (together with the Facebook Basic Information, the "Facebook Data"). Trippy will comply with Facebook's policies regarding Facebook Data and respect your wishes regarding the same. For more information regarding Facebook's policies please refer to the Facebook Privacy Policy.

**Cookies Information:** When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Trippy help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.

However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

**Clear Gifs Information:** When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Trippy account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Trippy better for our users.

**Third Party Services:** Trippy uses third party analytics services such as Google analytics to help understand use of the Service. Third party analytics services collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies and your IP address.

We reserve the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. Trippy also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.

**How We Share Your Information**

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. We may also share personal information or content with third party services, such as social networking sites, if you direct us to do so. To change your privacy settings on the Service, go to your [account settings](https://web.archive.org/settings) page. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information. 

From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.

Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, Trippy will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/About_Trippy/Terms-of-Service.html), take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Trippy, our Users or others.
