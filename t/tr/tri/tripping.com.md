# Privacy Policy | Tripping.com

This policy describes Tripping.com's practices regarding personally identifiable information and data ("personal information"). This policy applies to our websites and social media accounts (the "Services"). When you use the Services, you agree to the terms in this policy. Remember that your use of the Services is at all times subject to the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.tripping.com/about/terms), which incorporates this privacy policy. Any terms we use in this privacy policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms and Conditions. 

## Information Overview

When you visit the Services, we may collect information about your visit. This information can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location. This is a standard practice for most websites and it enables us to provide higher quality service for our users. 

If you inquire about an accommodation via the Services, we may request additional information from you, which may include your name, email address and telephone number. 

In addition, we collect personal information from you, such as first and last name, date of birth, e-mail address, and password, when you register for our services. When registering, we may also collect financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address and credit card number. If you choose a third-party service, like Facebook Login, to register or login, you are permitting us to use and store certain profile information related to the third-party account, such as your name and contact information. 

If you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us. 

## How we collect your Personal Information

We collect your personal information directly from you and with your consent. For example, you may provide your personal information (such as your phone number) when you register with us or inquire about accommodations. 

We also collect your personal information passively. For example, we collect anonymized information about you over time and across different Websites when you use the Services. We also use tracking tools like cookies and beacons. To learn more about these tools and how to control them, please see below. 

## How we use your Personal Information

There are several reasons as to why we may collect your personal information. More than anything, it's to provide excellent customer service and to consistently improve our Services and products. We may also collect it for the below reasons: 

  1. To allow you to register with, log-in, and use, our services. 
  2. To process your accommodation requests and inquiries.
  3. To display more relevant advertising and recommendations, or suppress advertising and content that you might find irrelevant.
  4. To contact you, including as follows: 
    * To send confirmations that we've received your inquiries;
    * To get in touch if you contact us in connection with the Services;
    * To send you marketing emails from a Tripping.com address regarding our Services or those of our Partners, provided you have opted-in to receive emails from us or have transacted with us, and as permitted by law. (We hate spam so we'll always do our best to send emails that are targeted to your interests.)



## Your Choices

Marketing email has an opt-out URL and you can unsubscribe from such communications at any time. You cannot unsubscribe from servicing emails and administrative messages that are considered part of your account membership, unless you cancel your membership. To change or modify your communication preferences please email support@tripping.com. 

## How we share your Personal Information

Your privacy is important to us and we will only share your personal information in connection with your use of the Services. With this in mind, we may share information with our corporate affiliates and with third parties for legitimate business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your personal information with suppliers that perform services on our behalf. Unless we tell you differently, such suppliers do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. 

We may also share anonymous aggregated usage information with others. 

In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we're affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. For example, if you inquire through the Services, we may share your personal information with the Partners and the accommodation owners you have inquired to regarding products or services such third parties make available via the Services. If you choose to engage in any business or take part in any transaction with such third parties, the third parties will process your personal information in accordance with their own terms and conditions and privacy policies. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service with any such supplier or third party, please review all such parties' policies. 

We may also share your information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. For example, if you provide information to enter a sweepstakes, we may share your information with the promotional partners. We will disclose this in the terms of the sweepstakes so that you have the option to opt-out at any time. 

If Tripping.com itself (or part of its business) is sold or otherwise changes control, the new owners may have access to your personal information for the uses set out herein. 

We may disclose personal information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities. This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal information if the disclosure is necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in response to a legal action or to enforce our rights and claims. 

## How we store and protect your Personal Information

Our servers and data centers are located in the U.S, and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments to limit use of and protect your personal information. 

Tripping.com has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third party suppliers, who require such access to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy. 

## Cookies and tracking tools

Tripping.com uses cookies and tracking tools. To learn more, including how we respond to "Do not track" signals, see below. 

## Other Websites

If you click through to third party websites or other services, Tripping.com's privacy policy does not apply on the other websites and services. 

## Children

Tripping.com does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for an account on the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we become aware that anyone under the age of 13 has submitted or is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records. If you believe that a child under the age of 13 has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it. 

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will endeavor to notify you of material changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing them, but will not be liable for any failure to do so. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website. We also encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. By using the Services after we post these changes, you indicate you accept them. 

## Accessing and rectifying your Personal Information

You can manage your account settings in the "My Account" page on Tripping.com. Through your account settings, you may access, edit, or delete the personal information you have provided to us. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You can delete your account by emailing support@tripping.com at any time. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your personal information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

## Cookies and other tracking tools

We (or our Partners or suppliers) use several common tracking tools. We use these tools to collect usage and demographic information about you over time and across different Websites when you use our Services. We also have third parties (e.g. advertisers) that collect personal information this way. Tools we use may include browser cookies. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small file. 

We and our advertising partners may also use web beacons (single pixel GIF images). These web beacons are placed in the code of a Web page or an email newsletter. 

By using the Services, you give us your free, unambiguous and informed consent to the use of any of the cookies and tracking tools mentioned in this policy. 

Tripping.com uses tracking tools for following purposes: 

  1. To track new visitors to the Services.
  2. To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor. This includes saving and remembering any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting the Services, such as language.
  3. To store your username and password if you are registered with us.
  4. To work with online advertising companies to display targeted advertising on our Services and third party platforms that you visit. This targeting may be based on information you submit on our Services or third party platforms or services. This targeting may also be based on your activities or behaviors on our Services or those of third parties. We may also obtain information about your browsing history from our business partners. To learn more about targeted advertising and how you can accept or refuse (opt-out of) this type of advertisements, we recommend that you visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or www.youronlinechoices.eu.
  5. To track when you book on Partner websites.
  6. To help improve our Services and for capacity planning purposes. We or our third party service providers may set analytics cookies. These allow us to gather aggregated or segmented information about the types of visitors that access our Services and the pages and advertisements that they view. We do not use this information to personally identify you.



## How you can control tracking tools and opt-out of online behavioral advertising

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How to do this varies from browser to browser. You should view the Help menu on the browser you use for further information. 

To opt out of having your online behavior tracked for advertising purposes [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). 

We may also use Google Analytics to collect anonymized demographic and interest data about you (such as age, gender, and interests), including through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. You can find out more about Google Analytics and how to opt-out by going here. Choices you make are browser and device specific. Some aspects of our site use cookies to function. You may not be able to use these features if you set your device to block cookies. If you block or delete cookies or opt out of online behavioral advertising, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop. 

## How Tripping.com responds to "Do Not Track" signals

Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.
