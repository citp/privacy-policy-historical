# Privacy Policy | Tripping.com

* * *

This policy describes Tripping.com’s practices regarding personally identifiable information and data (“personal information”). This policy applies to our websites and social media accounts (the “Platforms”). When you use the Platforms, you agree to the terms in this policy.

## Information Overview

When you visit the Platforms, we may collect information about your visit. This information is anonymized and can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location. This is a standard practice for most websites and it enables us to provide higher quality service for our users.

If you inquire about an accommodation via the Platforms, we may request additional information from you. Collected only with your consent, this information may include your name, email address and telephone number. 

If you use our Concierge Service, we will collect your travel information so that we can search for accommodations on your behalf. Since we need your contact information in order to help with your accommodations request, we may ask for personal information such as your phone number or email address.

If you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us. 

## How we collect your Personal Information

We collect your personal information directly from you and with your consent. For example, you may provide your personal information (such as your phone number) when you inquire about accommodations. 

We also collect your personal information passively. For example, we collect anonymized information about you over time and across different Websites when you visit this Platform. We also use tracking tools like cookies and beacons. To learn more about these tools and how to control them, please see below.

## How we use your Personal Information

There are several reasons as to why we may collect your personal information. More than anything, it’s to provide excellent customer service and to consistently improve our Platforms and products. We may also collect it for the below reasons:

  1. To process your accommodation requests and inquiries.
  2. To display more relevant advertising and recommendations, or suppress advertising and content that you might find irrelevant.
  3. To contact you, including as follows:


  * » To send confirmations that we’ve received your inquiries;
  * » To get in touch if you contact Tripping.com’s Concierge Service;
  * » To send you marketing emails from a Tripping.com address regarding our services or those of our partners, provided you have opted-in to receive emails from us or have transacted with us, and as permitted by law. (We hate spam so we’ll always do our best to send emails that are targeted to your interests.)



## Your Choices

Every marketing email has an opt-out URL and you can unsubscribe from such communications at any time. 

## How we share your Personal Information

Your privacy is important to us and we will only share information if it’s in your interest provided the other party agrees to protect and not further disclose any of your personal information. With this in mind, we may share information with our corporate affiliates and with third parties for legitimate business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your personal information with suppliers that perform services on our behalf and have agreed in writing to protect and not further disclose your information. We may also share anonymous aggregated usage information with others.

If you inquire through the Platforms, we may share your personal information with the partners and the accommodation owners you have inquired to. These third parties will process your personal information as data controllers in accordance with their own privacy policies.

We may also share your information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. For example, if you provide information to enter a sweepstakes, we may share your information with the promotional partners. We will disclose this in the terms of the sweepstakes so that you have the option to opt-out at any time.

If Tripping.com itself (or part of its business) is sold or otherwise changes control, the new owners may have access to your personal information for the uses set out herein.

We may disclose personal information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities. This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal information if the disclosure is necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in response to a legal action or to enforce our rights and claims.

## How we store and protect your Personal Information

Our servers and data centers are located in the U.S, and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments based on the EU model clauses.

Tripping.com has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third party suppliers, who require such access to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy.

## Cookies and tracking tools

Tripping.com uses cookies and tracking tools. To learn more, including how we respond to “Do not track” signals, see below.

## Other Websites

If you click through to third party websites or other platforms, Tripping.com’s privacy policy does not apply on the other websites and platforms.

## Children

Tripping.com does not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that a minor is attempting to submit personal information, we will remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice. We will notify you of material changes to how we use your personal information prior to implementing them. We may notify you about such a material change by email or prominent notice on our website. By using our services and Platforms after we post these changes, you indicate you accept them.

## Accessing and rectifying your Personal Information

You are entitled at any time to obtain information about all your personal information that we store, in accordance with applicable law and without any fee. However, in exceptional cases we ask you to pay reasonable fee before we provide the information if permitted by applicable law. We may request proof of your identity before providing this information. We may not be able to allow you to access certain personal information in some cases. For example if your personal information is connected with personal information of other persons, or for legal reasons. In such cases we will provide you with an explanation why you cannot obtain this information. You can also withdraw your consent to the use of your personal information at any time by contacting us at the address below. You can demand deletion or rectification of your personal information, however, statutory provisions, especially those affecting Tripping.com’s accounting, processing of claims, and mandatory data retention, may prohibit deletion or anonymization.

To exercise your rights, or if you have questions about our privacy practices or need assistance with exercising or understanding your privacy choices, please contact our Privacy Officer at privacy@Tripping.com or you may write to:

Cookies and other tracking tools

We (or our partners and suppliers) use several common tracking tools. We use these tools to collect usage and demographic information about you over time and across different Websites when you use our Platforms. We also have third parties (e.g. advertisers) that collect personal information this way. Tools we use may include browser cookies. Your browser will store these cookies on your computer in a small file.

We and our advertising partners may also use web beacons (single pixel GIF images). These web beacons are placed in the code of a Web page or an email newsletter.

By using the Platforms, you give us your free, unambiguous and informed consent to the use of any of the cookies and tracking tools mentioned in this policy.

## Tripping.com uses tracking tools for following purposes

  * (i) To track new visitors to the Platforms.
  * (ii) To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor. This includes saving and remembering any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting the Platforms, such as language.
  * (iii) To work with online advertising companies to display targeted advertising on our Platforms and third party platforms that you visit. This targeting may be based on information you submit on our Platforms or third party platforms. This targeting may also be based on your activities or behaviors on our Platforms or those of third parties. We may also obtain information about your browsing history from our business partners. To learn more about targeted advertising and how you can accept or refuse (opt-out of) this type of advertisements, we recommend that you visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

  * (vi) To help improve our website offering and for capacity planning purposes. We or our third party service providers may set analytics cookies. These allow us to gather aggregated or segmented information about the types of visitors that access our Platforms and the pages and advertisements that they view. We do not use this information to personally identify you.



## How you can control tracking tools and opt-out of online behavioral advertising

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How to do this varies from browser to browser. You should view the Help menu on the browser you use for further information.

To opt out of having your online behavior tracked for advertising purposes [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

We may also use Google Analytics to collect anonymized demographic and interest data about you (such as age, gender, and interests), including through Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. You can find out more about Google Analytics and how to opt-out by going [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357). Choices you make are browser and device specific. Some aspects of our site use cookies to function. You may not be able to use these features if you set your device to block cookies. If you block or delete cookies or opt out of online behavioral advertising, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop.

## How Tripping.com responds to “Do Not Track” signals

Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.
