## About Your Personal Information and Uses

### What Personal Information Does Trip.com Hold on Me and Others?

  * Information You Provide Us Directly 

Trip.com collects and uses the information you provide to us directly in order to provide you with the services you request. For example, you may provide us your name, gender, birthday, mobile number, email, and other information when you register a Trip.com account. When booking flight or train tickets, or using our car rental service, you may provide passenger names, genders, ID document numbers and the contact person’s name, mobile number, email and delivery address, as well as other information. When booking hotels and tickets for tourist attractions, you may provide the travelers’ names, contact person’s name, mobile number, and email, etc. When paying for travel products, you may provide your bank card number, the mobile number previously provided to the bank, or your credit card number, cardholder name, expiry date, etc.

In order for us to customize the services we provide you, we may also collect information about your travel plans and preferences which includes your meal requirements, departure date, check-in and check-out times, seat choice, ticket choice, insurance choice, and your selection of other services (such as car rental, attraction tickets, and travel guides, etc.) provided by Trip.com. 

If you need to get in touch with our customer service team, or reach out to us through other means (such as through social media) we will collect information from you there too, such as your name and contact information.

You may also participate in referral programs or sweepstakes. Doing so will also mean providing us with your name and contact information. In addition to this, you can provide us with feedback or ask for help with using Trip.com’s travel services.

You may be travelling with other guests or make a booking on someone else’s behalf, in which case you will provide similar details to Trip.com. However, we would like to remind you that it is your responsibility to ensure that the person or people whose personal information you have provided are aware that you’ve done so, and have agreed to your sharing of their personal information with Trip.com for these purposes.

  * Information We Collect Automatically 

Trip.com collects some information about you automatically. Specifically:

Log information, which refers to information that the system may automatically collect through cookies, a web beacon, or other channels when you use our services, including:

    * Information contained in the content you share through our services, such as a photo shared or uploaded, comments, and dates and times, etc. 

Location information, which we collect when you turn on your device’s location feature and use our location-based services. This includes your geographical position information collected via GPS or WIFI, your address information contained in the account information you provide to us, and shared information uploaded by you or others showing your current or previous location. You can turn off the location feature to prevent us from collecting your location information.

Use of Cookies. A cookie is a text file that a web server puts on your device with the following general purposes: 

    * To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site. We also may keep you logged in if you checked the box entitled "Sign me in automatically next time."
    * To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to you on this website and on other sites across the Internet. For example, when you access a page on our website, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.
    * To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon).

You are not obligated to accept cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel services offered on our site.

  * Information We Receive Through Other Sources 

We will also obtain your information from affiliates and business partners.

Also, we allow you to log into Trip.com with your social media account, and with your consent (you grant authorization to the social platform), your personal information will be shared with us through that social platform.

Additionally, we may integrate calling services into our platforms to enable you to connect with us, and when we do, we receive metadata about the call activities (such as where you called from, who you are, and the date and length of the call).

### Where will My Personal Data be Processed?

Trip.com is a global company that operates both inside and outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). It also cooperates with third-party vendors located both inside and outside of the EEA.

Whenever such transfer occurs, it is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any future replacement) in order to provide your personal information a level of data protection that applies within the EEA. You can contact us at [en_dataprotection@trip.com](mailto:en_dataprotection@trip.com) for further information.




We may share your booking information, account information, device information, and location information with affiliate companies within our corporate family and third parties, such as the partners detailed below, to ensure the successful provision of services to you. Our partners include the following types:

    * **Providers:** including but not limited to hotels, airlines, cruise lines, car rental agencies, travel agencies, scenic spot operators, and event providers and agents that meet your booking needs. These providers may contact you as needed to provide you with travel products or services.

Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel provider whose products you purchase through Trip.com.
    * **Third party vendors:** We may work with third party vendors under contract to us to provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes, and fraud prevention.

## What are My Rights?

### Erasure, Access, and Others

If you wish to delete your Trip.com account information, you may call our customer support (<https://pages.trip.com/service-guideline/contact-us-en-us.html>) noted on Trip.com’s official website, and follow the instruction to be put through to a customer service specialist who will help you delete your account information after completing a verification process. After the deletion, we will no longer collect, use, or share any personal information related to this account.

You can request that we delete your personal information if you no longer want us to use your information to provide Services to you.

In addition, you can request access to your personal information, request that any inaccuracies be corrected, and request that comments or explanations be added to records about you. You may also request that we transmit to another service provider (where technically feasible) copies of your personal information that is structured and in machine-readable format.

Finally, you can ask us not to collect or use your personal information for certain purposes, or you can ask us to either refrain from sharing your information with, or specifically ask that we do not provide your personal information to, a third party.

The rights listed above may not apply in all cases. For example, if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping, we may not be able to delete all of your personal information, in which case we will inform you of the relevant exceptions.

We will respond to your above requests without undue delay. Trip.com reserves the right to take reasonable steps to verify customer identity before taking further action on your request.

To address any privacy or security questions or concerns, or to make any of these requests, contact us with details about your request at [en_dataprotection@trip.com](mailto:en_dataprotection@trip.com).

### How Can I Lodge a Complaint?

We are committed to investigating and resolving complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. To make a complaint, contact us at [en_dataprotection@trip.com](mailto:en_dataprotection@trip.com).

Clearly provide the following information to help us address the issue effectively:

We aim to resolve all issues in a timely manner, or as mandated by applicable law, but if this is not possible because a more detailed investigation is required, we will keep in regular contact with you to ensure that you are kept informed of the resolution of your matter.

## Use of This Website by Children

This website is not intended for anyone under the age of 16 years old. If you are under 16, you may not register with, or use this website. 

## Special Category of Personal Information 

In connection with fulfilling your travel requests for disability considerations and dietary preferences, some information you provide us may be considered as “special category” personal information. Any processing of such information by Trip.com is based on the consent you grant at the time of collection.

When you use either the mobile phone or tablet apps of Trip.com (herein collectively referred to as the “Mobile App”), we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as we do when you use our website.

In addition to this, we also use some other information that we collect automatically when you use our Mobile App. Specifically:

  * • We collect information about Mobile App functionality based on what parts of the Mobile App you access and use. This allows us to identify those areas of the Mobile App that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Mobile App. The information we collect for this purpose does not enable us to directly identify you.
  * • Each Mobile App also sends us the device's unique device identifier, a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your mobile device.
  * • When you use the Mobile App, you can choose to allow access to your current location—provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies—in order to identify nearby hotels or airports. If you choose to allow access, this location data may be collected anonymously by our servers. You can switch off the Mobile App’s access to your location at any time through your phone’s settings menu.
  * • Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the event that it crashes or hangs. This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future releases. As part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used, and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and remedying the error.



If you do not want our Mobile App to collect such information from you, you can remove the Mobile App from your mobile device entirely and access our services through our website instead.

## Information Security and Protection

Trip.com attaches great importance to information security and has set up a dedicated team for this. We strive to protect your personal information and have taken appropriate managerial, technological, and physical security measures. 

In terms of the data life cycle, we have established security measures for all stages including data collection, storage, display, processing, use, and destruction. We take different control measures according to the level of information sensitivity, including but not limited to access control, SSL encryption transmission, and high-level encryption algorithms for encrypted storage, in order to mask the sensitive information to be displayed, etc.

Notwithstanding the foregoing security measures, please also understand that there are no “perfect security measures” for the internet. We rely on currently available technologies and take appropriate security measures to protect your information.

Your account has in-built security features. You are advised to properly safeguard your account and password and do not disclose your password to any person. If you discover your personal information has been leaked, especially your account and password, please contact our customer service staff immediately so that we can take the appropriate measures.

In the unlikely event of a data breach affecting your personal information, we will inform you in accordance with laws and regulations by email or other means.

## Marketing Preferences

You also have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes at any time. You can exercise this right by contacting us at any time. You can also opt out of receiving any non-essential emails, including marketing emails, by clicking the unsubscribe link contained at the bottom of such emails or by adjusting the notification settings in your account profile on the Trip.com website or app.

## Acting as a Processor

When our business clients contract with Trip.com or its affiliate companies to provide services, we work at the direction of our clients as a processor. This means that our clients dictate how we use the data they provide, how long to retain such data, and whether and how we assist with any data-related requests. If you are an end user customer of one of our business clients and have a privacy-related request or question, please contact that organization. We will assist our business clients to fulfil your request at their instruction.

## Modification of Privacy Statement

Trip.com will modify this Privacy Statement when necessary. Please understand that we may revise this Privacy Statement at times as we consider appropriate. We will note the date of the latest update of this Privacy Statement and the update will take effect when it is published. Without your explicit consent, Trip.com will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Statement. Trip.com will prominently post major changes made (for example, for changes concerning certain services, we will inform you via email of the specific changes in the Privacy Statement). Therefore, you should review this Privacy Statement periodically to keep up with our most current policies.
