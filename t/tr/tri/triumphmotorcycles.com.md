# Privacy and Cookie Policy | For the Ride

We ask that you read this privacy notice carefully as it contains important information on who we are, how and why we collect, store, use and share personal information, your rights in relation to your personal information and on how to contact us and supervisory authorities in the event you have a complaint.

We may change this privacy notice from time to time. We will tell you when the notice was last updated, so you may take the time to read it if it has changed since your last visit.  **Privacy notice last updated: 11th May 2018**

**Who we are**  
Triumph Motorcycles Group Limited (Triumph Motorcycles Limited, Ashby Road, Measham, Swadlincote, Derbyshire, DE12 7JP) collects, uses and is responsible for certain personal information about you. When we do so we are regulated under the General Data Protection Regulation which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom).

**Information collected**  
We collect information about you when you use our online services, when you buy products or services from us and, in some cases, on paper (e.g. when you fill in a form at a dealer or when you visit one of our stands at a show). We collect the following information when you provide it to us: your name, address and contact details. We may also collect other personal information about you if it is relevant to the service you have requested (e.g. we might ask you for your age or about your driving licence if you are requesting a test ride). 

**Information collected from other sources**  
We also obtain personal information from other sources as follows:  
Website usage information, collected through the use of cookies (see the cookie section below for more details).   
Triumph Dealerships provide us with your contact details if you have asked to receive information or services from us, including purchase of a bike.  
We may use public sources of data, for example, to support website functionality (e.g. to support authentication), and/or to maintain the accuracy of the information we hold. For example, we may check with the DVLA to ensure we have accurate owner information.

Please note: Personal data collected through the American website, TriumphMotorcycles.com, is collected and stored in the USA. If you complete a form or provide personal data in any other way on this part of our site, your data will be processed in accordance with privacy laws in the USA.

**How we use your personal information**

We may also use third party e-mail services to help us conduct market research. One of the companies used by us is Survey Gizmo, their privacy policy is available at <http://www.surveygizmo.com/privacy/> (includes cookie information). The privacy policy covers Triumph as users of the system and you as someone responding to our surveys.

We endeavour to ensure all of our third party recipients are within the European Economic Area, however sometimes your personal data may by necessity be outside of the EEA – for further information including how we safeguard your personal data, see ‘Transfer of your information out of the EEA’.

We do not allow other companies to collect your personally identifiable data through our online services unless it is needed to provide a service you have requested.

We will share personal information with law enforcement or other authorities if required by applicable law.

We will not share or sell your personal data with any other third party.

**Whether information has to be provided by you, and if so why**  
The provision of your name, address, delivery address is required from you to enable us to provide the goods you have purchased from us.  
The provision of your phone number is required from you to enable us to ensure dealerships can provide any test rides you may have requested. The provision of driving licence details is required for the same purpose.  
The provision of your email address is required from you where you have requested us to provide you with our e-newsletter and, in electronic format, product information or marketing information including promotional information.

**How long your personal information will be kept**  
We will hold your name, address, contact details and VIN number(s) for the lifetime of the bike you have purchased, or until such time as you inform us of a change of ownership. We may also keep it to comply with our legal obligations, respond to queries and resolve any disputes, to meet our legitimate interests.  
Your contact details used for marketing will be kept until you inform us that you no longer wish to receive such information from us, or until you have not interacted with Triumph for a period of 18 (eighteen) months.

**Transfer of your information out of the EEA**  
Where Triumph Motorcycles shares personal information with a third party located outside the EEA, we conduct internal checks and use measures as approved by the European Commission to support adequate transfer of the information.

Internal checks identify if the country has been approved by the European Commission as having essentially equivalent data protection laws, or if there is a programme in place, such as the EU-US Privacy Shield programme, that the European Commission has approved as adequate. More information about the protections the European Commission has considered is available here

**Your rights**  
Under the General Data Protection Regulation you have a number of important rights in connection with your personal information. These include the following: to withdraw consent where you have given it, to be informed and have access to your personal information, to be able to correct or complete inaccurate data, and in certain circumstances to restrict, request erasure, object to processing, or request portability of your personal information to another organisation.

Further information on each of these rights, including the circumstances in which they may apply, is available from the Data Protection Authority. [DPA Index]

If you would like to unsubscribe from any email newsletter, service emails or marketing you can also use the ‘unsubscribe’ option at the bottom of our email marketing communications to you. It can take up to 7 [seven] working days for this to take place, and if we are in the middle of a campaign you may still receive emails until it is completed.

**Keeping your personal information secure**  
We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it, and require all the third parties we work with to have appropriate measures in place to maintain the security of your information.

We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.

**How to complain**  
We hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information.  
The General Data Protection Regulation also gives you the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the European Union state where you work, normally live or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred. The supervisory authority in the UK is the Information Commissioner who may be contacted at https://ico.org.uk/concerns/ or telephone 0044 303 123 1113
