# Trimble - Privacy Statement

| 

**Privacy Statement**

 ****

****Last Updated: July 11, 2001

**Trimble's Commitment to Online Privacy**

 ****

****Your right to privacy is important. At Trimble we believe that personal information you choose to furnish online should only be used to help us provide you with the highest quality of products, services and support. We display this Privacy Statement to make you aware of the information practices for Trimble Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. We may update our Privacy Statement from time to time to stay current with changes in our business and to better serve you. A notice will be posted on our Web site home page whenever this Privacy Statement is amended so that you can inform yourself of any changes.  
 

**The Information We Collect Online and How It's Used**

 ****

****You can browse our Web site without entering any personal information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. Only general, non-personally identifiable information that Trimble logs from all site visits, such as Internet service provider, operating system/browser type, and pages accessed, will be collected in those instances. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will not be individually identified. There are times, however, when we or our business partners may need information from you. For example, you may choose to give us personal information when you:

  * Purchase products or services
  * Register as a user of Trimble products 
  * Make requests for materials, customer and other services, and product support, repairs and upgrades
  * Subscribe to newsletters and online services
  * Enter Trimble-sponsored contests, sweepstakes and other promotions
  * Create a user profile to receive future information, special offers and communications



At such times we may ask you to provide contact and billing information (e.g., your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and expiration date), as well as information about the product or service purchased (e.g., product I.D., serial number, customer number, product version). We also may request demographic or other personal information, however, volunteering such information is optional with you. We may use the information you provide to notify you later about new developments with respect to the products and services you have purchased; to inform you about new products, special offers and services offered by Trimble its family of affiliated companies or its business partners; to provide you with a more personal experience on our site; or to analyze sales trend data as it relates to geography, time, and demographics. In all such cases, Trimble keeps the information you provide confidential.

Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide through other avenues, such as through warranty card product registration.  
 

**With Whom We Share Information**

 ****

****In the ordinary course of business Trimble will not sell, trade or rent your individual identifying information to others. Trimble may share the personal data you provide online with Trimble's family of affiliated companies, its agents and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above or otherwise to support your customer relationship. In all events, Trimble requires that its affiliates, agents and business partners keep confidential any individual identifying information disclosed to them. (In the unlikely event of a sale or transfer of assets by Trimble outside the normal course of business, such customer information may be one of the transferred assets.)

Finally, Trimble may release personal identifying information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of our user agreements (e.g., Trimble Web Site Terms of Use), or (iii) to protect the rights, property or safety of Trimble, our Web site users, or others.  
 

**Choice**

 ****

****Trimble will not share personal identifying information provided to us online except as stated above without allowing you the opportunity of consenting to or opting out of such disclosures. When you place an order for Trimble products, register as a user of Trimble products, services or promotions, or when you submit a user profile you are given the opportunity of notifying us as to whether you would like to receive future information, special offers and communications via email. All unsolicited email marketing and promotional communications contain an opportunity for you to decline future communications. Additionally, at any time you can opt-out of receiving such further information from Trimble by sending your opt-out request to[ privacy@Trimble.com](mailto:privacy@trimble.com). Trimble will use its best efforts to comply promptly with all such requests.  
 

**Cookies**

 ****

****"Cookies" are small pieces of information stored in your browser on you computer's hard drive. Some Trimble pages use cookies, sent by Trimble or its third-party agents, to better serve you when you return to the site. If you prefer not to receive cookies you have the option of setting your browser to warn you before accepting cookies or to reject them altogether. If you do so, however, some areas of some sites may not function properly.  
 

**Links**

 ****

****Our Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Trimble is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.  
 

**Information** **Security and Quality**

 ****

****Trimble intends to protect the quality and integrity of your personal identifying information. Industry-standard encryption technologies are employed when receiving or transferring sensitive data such as personal identifying information in order to prevent its unauthorized use. Only employees of Trimble or Trimble affiliates, or Trimble's third-party agents who need the information to perform a specific task (for example, order processing and fulfillment), are granted access to personal identifying information. We will make a sincere effort to respond in a timely manner to your requests to review or correct any personal identifying information that Trimble may maintain about you.  
 

**How to Contact Us**

****If you have requests or questions in connection with this Privacy Statement you may contact us at[ privacy@Trimble.com](mailto:privacy@trimble.com).
