# Online Privacy

### Trimble's Commitment to Online Privacy 

Last updated: November 18, 2014 

Your right to privacy is important. At Trimble we believe that personal information you choose to furnish online should only be used to help us provide you with the highest quality of products, services and support. We display this Privacy Statement to make you aware of the information practices for Trimble websites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. We may update our Privacy Statement from time to time to stay current with changes in our business and to better serve you. We encourage you to visit this page frequently to inform yourself of any changes.

This Privacy Statement covers Trimble's family of corporate websites, which include:

#### Consent to Use and Transfer Personal Data

**Please note that if you submit personal data through the Trimble websites, you will send it to us (Trimble Navigation Limited), in the United States.   We will collect, process and transfer your personal data in accordance with this Data Privacy Statement but possibly not in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which your reside.  By submitting your personal data through a Trimble web site you consent to Trimble's collection, use, storage and transfer of your personal data to our company databases and other repositories, wherever located, for the purposes for which it is submitted and in accordance with the policies set forth in this Privacy Statement.**

#### Types of Data Collected Online

You can browse most of our web sites without entering any personal information. Only general, non-personally identifiable information that Trimble logs from all site visits, such as Internet service provider, operating system/browser type, and pages accessed, will be collected in those instances. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will not be individually identified. 

There are times, however, when we or our business partners (such as our external service providers identified below) may need information from you. 

For example, you may choose to give us personal information when you: 

  * Access or register for access on some of our websites, for example, [http://www.gpspathfinderexpress.com](http://www.gpspathfinderexpress.com/) or [http://learn.trimble.com](http://learn.trimble.com/).

  * Apply to be considered for employment in connection with a job opening at Trimble.

At such times you may be asked to provide contact and billing information (e.g., your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and expiration date), as well as information about the product or service purchased (e.g., product I.D., serial number, customer number, product version). Demographic or other personal information may also be requested, however, volunteering such information is optional. By providing the information to Trimble you consent to our transfer of this information to our company databases and other repositories, wherever located. 

#### Use of Data 

Trimble uses personal information collected on its websites for the purposes for which it is requested or as necessary or permissible under applicable law (e.g., in some jurisdictions we may have to keep invoices under tax laws).  We also may use the information you provide to notify you later about new developments with respect to the products and services you have purchased or to inform you about new products, special offers and services offered by Trimble, its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Trimble Companies") or its business partners.  It is important to note that you may opt out of receiving further information from Trimble, as discussed in detail below. We use non-personal information to analyze sales trend data as it relates to geography, time and demographics.

In connection with a job application or inquiry advertised on a Trimble Website, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae.  We may use this information throughout Trimble and the Trimble Companies for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry.  Except where you tell us not to, we will keep the information for future consideration.

Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Privacy Policy (if any) may be found in the Terms of Use or Terms of Service or privacy policies applicable to a particular service, contest or promotion. To the extent that you are notified of potential uses of your personal information that are different from those described in this Privacy Policy during your service agreement with us or enrollment in a particular contest or promotion, the uses of information set forth in that agreement, contest or promotion will supersede this Privacy Policy. Please review carefully the Terms of Use, Terms of Service and privacy policies applicable to the service(s) that you have purchased or the contests or promotions for which you sign-up or in which you participate.
