**Privacy Statement**

 ****

****Effective date: December 3, 2002

**Trimble's Commitment to Online Privacy**

 ****

****Your right to privacy is important. At Trimble we believe that personal information you choose to furnish online should only be used to help us provide you with the highest quality of products, services and support. We display this Privacy Statement to make you aware of the information practices for Trimble Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. We may update our Privacy Statement from time to time to stay current with changes in our business and to better serve you. A notice will be posted on our Web site home page whenever this Privacy Statement is amended so that you can inform yourself of any changes.

This Statement covers Trimble's family of corporate web sites, which include:

**The Information We Collect Online and How It's Used**

 ****

****You can browse our Web site without entering any personal information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. Only general, non-personally identifiable information that Trimble logs from all site visits, such as Internet service provider, operating system/browser type, and pages accessed, will be collected in those instances. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will not be individually identified. There are times, however, when we or our business partners may need information from you*. For example, you may choose to give us personal information when you:

  * Purchase products or services
  * Register as a user of Trimble products 
  * Make requests for materials, customer and other services, and product support, repairs and upgrades
  * Subscribe to newsletters and online services
  * Enter Trimble-sponsored contests, sweepstakes and other promotions
  * Create a user profile to receive future information, special offers and communications



At such times we may ask you to provide contact and billing information (e.g., your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and expiration date), as well as information about the product or service purchased (e.g., product I.D., serial number, customer number, product version). We also may request demographic or other personal information, however, volunteering such information is optional with you.  By providing the information to Trimble you consent to our transfer of this information to our company databases and other repositories, wherever located. 

We may use the information you provide to notify you later about new developments with respect to the products and services you have purchased; to inform you about new products, special offers and services offered by Trimble its family of affiliated companies or its business partners; to provide you with a more personal experience on our site; or to analyze sales trend data as it relates to geography, time, and demographics. In all such cases, Trimble keeps the information you provide confidential.

Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide through other avenues, such as through warranty card product registration.

* The following external service providers are collecting information on our web sites: 

  * [www.trimblestore.com](http://www.trimblestore.com/): 

Digital River, Inc., a leading e-commerce service provider, hosts and operates our online store at 

[www.trimblestore.com](http://www.trimblestore.com/). When you purchase our products and services from this online store, your contact and billing information will be collected by Digital River. Please view Digital River's Privacy Statement at [http://drhome.digitalriver.com/livehtml/newsite/dr_privacy_000.html](http://drhome.digitalriver.com/livehtml/newsite/dr_privacy_000.html) for a full description of Digital River's comprehensive information privacy procedures and security system.

We do not receive sensitive financial information such as credit card numbers from Digital River. The information we receive from them includes only your contact details, your opt-in/opt-out preference and transaction information such as order date, number, product serial number etc. 




**With Whom We Share Information**

 ****

****In the ordinary course of business Trimble will not sell, trade or rent your individual identifying information to others. Trimble may share the personal data you provide online with Trimble's family of affiliated companies, its agents and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above or otherwise to support your customer relationship. In all events, Trimble requires that its affiliates, agents and business partners keep confidential any individual identifying information disclosed to them.

When you place an order for Trimble products, register as a user of Trimble products, services or promotions, or when you submit a user profile you are given the opportunity of notifying us as to whether you would like to receive future information, special offers and communications via email. All unsolicited email marketing and promotional communications contain an opportunity for you to decline future communications.
