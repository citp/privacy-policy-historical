<td width="100%"><p><b><font size="+1">Tri-City Herald PRIVACY POLICY</font></b></p>

<p>Tri-City Herald has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your privacy
concerns seriously and want to make every effort to address them. That is
why we have adopted the following policy, which explains our position on
information-gathering and disclosure.</p>

<p><!--[TRUSTe Certified] TO BE ADDED AT A LATER DATE, WHEN ATTAINED--></p>

<p><b>Your Personal Information</b></p>

<p>From time to time, we will ask for information that personally identifies
you, as in our user surveys or registration for Tri-City Herald services
such as e-mail, forums, or promotions. We use this information to operate
Tri-City Herald's services, provide you with the highest quality services
and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest.</p>

<p>We will <b>not</b> disclose any personal information without your advance
permission except when we believe the law requires us to do so or the disclosure
is necessary to protect the rights or property of Tri-City Herald, or as
explained below or in our <a href="user_agreement.html">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers
and others, we may disclose user information but only in a form that does
<b>not</b> identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that
a certain percentage of our users are male or within a certain age range.</p>

<p>Occasionally, we may disclose personal information in other circumstances,
but we will only do this if we have explained at the time we collect the
information the purpose for which it will be disclosed.</p>

<p><b>Kids' Privacy</b></p>

<p>Tri-City Herald is particularly concerned with providing a safe online
environment for kids. Therefore, in areas operated by Tri-City Herald that
are directed to kids or when we learn that a user is under the age of 13,
we will ask for parental consent before collecting additional personal information
about the child or allowing the child to use the Tri-City Herald services
to provide additional personal information. Parental consent can be provided
in two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Send a fax copy of a completed Parental Consent Form, including your
  signature, to the facsimile number provided on the <a href="parental_consent.html">Parental
  Consent Form</a> (which will be provided in applicable areas on our site);
  or
  </li><li>Call our toll-free number at the telephone number provided on the Parental
  Consent Form.
</li></ol>

<p>Tri-City Herald will not knowingly disclose personal information about
users under the age of 13 without prior parental consent, except as required
by law. If for any reason you wish to access, update or remove information
about your child or terminate your child's account, you may fax or call
Tri-City Herald at the numbers listed above or send an e-mail to [[EMAIL]]</p>

<p>Tri-City Herald strongly recommends parental supervision when a child
uses the Internet, and particularly when a child enters a forum or uses
e-mail. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to give
out personal information in these areas.</p>

<p><b>E-Commerce</b></p>

<p>Tri-City Herald hosts a number of online stores that sell a variety of
goods and services. These stores may collect information from you such as
your name, credit card number and other contact information. Tri-City Herald
does not collect, use or disclose this information nor does it own or control
the stores or have responsibility for transactions made by those merchants.
If you would like to know more about the information collected when you
participate in e-commerce on or through this site, please contact the store
merchants directly.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p>A "cookie" is a small data text file that is placed in your
browser and allows Tri-City Herald to recognize you each time you visit
this site. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information, and
Tri-City Herald does not use cookies to collect personal information. Instead,
they allow us to see which parts of our site you have used so that we can
better serve you when you return to our site. Cookies may be used to provide
you with information and special opportunities tailored to your interests.</p>

<p><b>Direct Mailings and "Opting Out"</b></p>

<p>We may send you information about various products and services. If you
don't want to receive this information, you can "opt out" by sending
us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:aperdue@tri-cityherald.com">aperdue@tri-cityherald.com</a>
and requesting that you not receive any of these of these offers.</p>

<p><b>You Can Change Your Private Information at any Time</b></p>

<p>Information you provide to Tri-City Herald may be stored by us for an
indefinite time. However, please feel free to change, update or delete this
information at any time by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:aperdue@tri-cityherald.com">aperdue@tri-cityherald.com</a></p>

<p><b>Remember The Risks Whenever You Use The Internet</b></p>

<p>You should know that when you voluntarily disclose personal information
on the Tri-City Herald system (for example, in forums), that information
can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages
from other people. While we do our best to protect your personal information,
we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to
Tri-City Herald and you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy
of any passwords or other account information. In addition, our partners
and other Internet sites or services that may be accessible through Tri-City
Herald have separate data and privacy practices independent of us, and therefore
we disclaim any responsibility or liability for their policies or actions.
Please contact those vendors and others directly if you have any questions
about their privacy policies.</p>

<p><b>Tell Us How We're Doing</b></p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments about our policies, please contact
us by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:aperdue@tri-cityherald.com">aperdue@tri-cityherald.com</a>.</p></td></tr>
