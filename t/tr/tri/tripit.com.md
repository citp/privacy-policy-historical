# TripIt Privacy Policy

(last revised May 13, 2014) 

[ ](https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Concur-Technologies/validation?rid=4fcfda29-644c-4fb3-ae00-fb94131a4122 "TRUSTe European Safe Harbor certification")

The following Privacy Policy ("Policy") summarizes the various ways that Concur Technologies, Inc., and its subsidiaries, and other affiliated and related companies ("Concur" or "us" or "we") use the information you provide to us or we gather from you while you access or use the website at [www.tripit.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Site"), our mobile applications ("App"), and our related sites and online services (collectively, the "Services"). It is our goal to provide you with information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, respect your privacy. 

Please read this Policy carefully. Your access to or use of any part of the Services will constitute your notice about our collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Policy. If you do not wish for us to collect, use, and disclose your information in accordance with this Policy, please do not access or use the Services. This Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline or on sites linked to through the Services. We may add to or amend this Policy with other notices. We may also post different privacy statements for some Services, and when we do so, this Policy does not apply. For example, separate policies and terms apply to information collected through our concur.com site and platform or our other mobile applications. 

This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Services and does not apply to any third-party activities, including third-party websites linked from our Services, third-party social networking platforms or features we make available through our Services, or third-party ads displayed on our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of those third parties. 

The Site has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with [TRUSTe's program requirements](http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html), including transparency, accountability, and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through downloadable software. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. The TRUSTe certification covers only information collected through [www.tripit.com](https://web.archive.org/) and does not cover information that may be collected through other Concur websites or our mobile applications. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us at [support@tripit.com](mailto:support@tripit.com). If you are not satisfied with our response, you can [contact TRUSTe](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint). 

## 1\. What Information We Collect from You

When you register with Concur or use our Services, we ask for your email address and password, name, home location, billing or mailing address, phone numbers, and other email addresses as well as other information including your travel information, history, preferences, and other demographic information. If you wish to purchase additional services we may collect your financial information (for example your credit card number, expiration date). If you also select to have Concur track your travel rewards points, Concur will store account details for each of your travel rewards points accounts, including each account's log-in username and password. 

### Information We Automatically Collect About Visits and Usage

For all Site visitors or App users, not just registered users, we collect information such as IP address, device identifier, browser type, device type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat information, time stamp, exit page information, and other information about how you use the Service. 

We use analytics, including analytics conducted by third-party services, to help analyze how users use the Services. To do this, we and our third-party service providers use _cookies_ (unique identifiers sent to your computer by a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive) and scripts to collect and store information such as how users interact with our Services, errors users encounter when using our Services, device identifiers, how often and for how long users visit and use the Services, which pages they visit on our Services, whether they act on or open emails, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use this information to improve our site and your user experience, such as remembering you when you return and log in, reducing the time it takes for you to create an itinerary, and knowing which of our web pages are visited and which services are most often used. 

### Email Auto-Import

You may associate your email accounts with the Service by providing us with log-in credentials for your email accounts. Once you have authorized us to do so by associating your accounts, we will use our automated technology to regularly review the contents of emails in your email accounts to look for travel and travel-rewards related emails, including those with information about recent bookings or reward-program statements. This information collected from your emails will be added to your TripIt account so that you may automatically access this information on the Service and so that we may use this information for other purposes described in this Policy. 

### Import Contacts and Tell-a-Friend

We utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and other members of Concur. We make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books and contact lists to join our Service and connect with you on our Site or to help find people who have already joined our Service. We do this at your request, by importing your email address books and contact lists to our servers. You may also provide us with an individual friend’s email address so that we may send them an invitation to visit the Service. 

### Location Data

We may collect precise geolocation data through our Services. We may use this information as described in this Policy, including, for example, to provide you with offers or opportunities based upon your location and travel plans. 

## 2\. What Information Others May Collect about You 

Other third parties may collect information about you through our Services, including personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Services. We describe some of those activities below, but understand that our Policy does not cover these or any other third parties, their products, actions, or their services. We cannot control how third parties collect, use, or secure your data. For information about third-party privacy practices, please consult their privacy policies. 

### Third-Party Sign-In and Features

You can log in to our Services using sign-in services provided by third parties, including certain third-party social networking platforms. Certain third-party services we may feature through our Services give you social media options to interact with buttons or widgets that let you like information or post information about your activities from our Site to third party sites and platforms publicly or within your network. These services will share certain personal information with us as described in the sign-in notices or in their privacy policies. 

### Third-Party Advertising

We may use third parties to serve ads in our Services. These third parties may automatically collect information about your use of the Services, visits to our websites and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, and the browser you use to visit our website (but not your name, address, email address, or telephone number). Third parties may collect information by using cookies, clear gifs, or other technologies. These third parties may use this information to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Services and the other websites tracked by these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifs in third-party ads. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. If you want more information about this practice and about your choices for many of our ad networks, go to the [TRUSTe website](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). 

### Our Ads on Third-Party Websites

We and our third-party partners may use information collected using third-party cookies and web beacons on our Services and in our emails to deliver ads about our Services displayed to you on third-party websites and applications. We also may use cookie information and other methods to know when you return to our Services after visiting these third-party websites and applications. We use this and other information about you to try to understand your interests and show you relevant advertising about products and services that may interest you. Our third party partners may also use this information for third-party advertising as described above. 

### Flash LSOs

When we post videos or other media on our blog, third parties may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences for volume control, or to personalize certain features. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie-management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, go to the [Macromedia website](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html). 

## 3\. How Your Information Is Used

In addition to the uses described in this policy, we may use personal information about you to create and maintain your travel itineraries and your travel profile, send you marketing messages about our Services and products and services of our partners, and otherwise provide you with and improve the Services. We also use the information that we gather to personalize and customize experience, content, marketing, and recommendations across all our Services, including to target content on our Services to more closely match your interests and, if you have selected to receive email communication from us, target email marketing messages that are more appropriate to your needs. We may use your personal information to respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service; send you information related to your requests and purchases, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages; communicate with you about contests, promotions, rewards, upcoming events, and process and deliver contest entries and rewards; link or combine your personal information with other information we get about your use of other Services and from third parties to help understand you and your needs, and provide you with recommendations, better service, and customized marketing; and protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity. 

## 4\. How Your Information Is Protected

We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to promote the integrity and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

## 5\. How Your Information Is Shared

When you use the Service, your personal information and your travel information will be shared with the third parties you designate for access to such information, including other companies, websites, mobile applications, your friends, relatives, and business associates. Depending upon the type of access you grant to such third parties, they may also be permitted to edit the information you have provided to us and to designate others to access and edit such information. You may change who has access to your information by going to your account settings and then changing your publishing options. 

You may choose to display certain information you give us in your public profile. Our Site also offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you choose to share in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others. 

In general, most of your travel-related information, such as upcoming destinations and travel statistics, is displayed only to other users of the Service to whom you have specifically connected as part of your TripIt network. You can change your privacy settings to designate which types of information are shared and with whom by visiting [Profile and Privacy](https://web.archive.org/account/edit/section/your_profile) page. You may also post information about your travel plans or current travel status through your TripIt connections or other social-networking connections or otherwise instruct the Service to automatically provide such information to other users of the Service and with your social-networking connections. 

### Information We May Share

In addition, we may share your personal information as follows: 

  * When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Concur, our users, or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our terms, contracts, and User Agreement.
  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, acquisition, consolidation, or asset sale (or the negotiation thereof), or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. We may assign or transfer your information as part of the transaction.
  * With third-party business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, such as a credit card processing company, email messaging providers, SMS providers, and other third parties that perform services on our behalf as a part of the Service. 
  * As required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site.



From time to time, we also may share general information about our Services, users, and visitors such as the number of visitors, aggregate and/or non-personally identifiable demographic and travel data, etc., with third parties (including with your employer, if your account was provided through your employer). 

We may also post customer feedback on the Site from time to time along with your first name and last initial.

### SMS Choices

You may manage the SMS alerts regarding flight delays, gate changes, and other alert information specific to your itinerary sent by the Service to your mobile device by following the opt-out instructions in each SMS message. 

### Do Not Track

We may not recognize or respond to every type of "do not track" signal or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, but we give you certain choices about how we collect personally identifiable information as described in this Policy. Many Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Site including certain opt-out cookies. Cookie management tools provided by your browser usually will not remove Flash cookies.
