# TripIt Privacy Policy

(last revised April 16, 2012) 

[](http://clicktoverify.truste.com/pvr.php?page=validate&url=www.tripit.com&sealid=102)

The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that we use the information you provide to us or we gather from you while you use the tripit.com online service (the "Service"), as provided by Concur Technologies, Inc. ("Concur" or "us" or "we"), through our website at www.tripit.com (the "Site"). It is our goal to provide you with information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, protect your privacy. 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of any part of the Service will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline or on sites linked to through the Service. 

In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/uhp/userAgreement). Your use of the Service constitutes agreement to the User Agreement as well. 

If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy in regards to how we utilize any personally identifiable information, we will post those changes on our homepage. 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy or if we change our email practices, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page. 

Concur, through our TripIt Service, is a Participant in the TRUSTe Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices [reviewed for compliance](http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html) by TRUSTe. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us at support@tripit.com. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe [here](http://clicktoverify.truste.com/pvr.php?page=validate&url=www.tripit.com&sealid=102). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with this Site to resolve your concerns. 

## 1\. What Information We Collect from You

When you register with Concur, we ask for your email address and password and once registered allow you to provide us with your name, home location and up to three other email addresses in order to access your account as well as other information including your travel information, history and preferences. Concur then uses this information to build personalized travel itineraries. 

If you wish to upgrade your account with us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address, mobile phone number) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. 

If you also select to have Concur track your travel rewards points, Concur will store account details for each of your travel rewards points accounts including each account's login username and password. 

For all Site visitors, not just registered users, we collect information such as IP address, browser type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, referring URL, platform, new and repeat information, time stamp and exit page information. 

If you contact us, we also will collect the information you provide that details the nature of your question or problem to enhance the quality of our Service. 

_Import Contacts_

We utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and other members of Concur. We make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books and contact lists to join you on our Site or to find people who have already joined our site. At your request we will search your email address book to help you import your contacts to our Site. We do not store your login information. When you request that Concur send an invitation email to your imported contacts, Concur stores this contact information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation email. The email that is sent to your friend will come from your email address so that your friends know that you want to invite them to visit the site. Concur does not store any passwords you provide as part of the contact import process. 

_Facebook_

The Service allows users to access Facebook to interact with friends and to share on Facebook through Wall and friends' News Feeds. If you are already logged into the Service and Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to merge your profiles. If you are already logged into the Service but not logged into Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to "Sign up for Facebook." By proceeding, you are allowing the Service to access your information and you are agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of the Service. 

Conversely, if you are not currently registered as a user of the Service and you click on "Sign in Using Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register for the Service. Once you register on the Site and Connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent activity back to Facebook. You have the option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging into your account through the Site and going to settings, "About Me", "Linked Accounts" and then unselecting "Facebook." Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect your Service activity stream by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page. 

_Google ID_

We allow you to use your Google ID in order to set up a TripIt Service account. If you wish to use your Google account you are taken to the Google website to login to your account, this information is then shared back with us for the sole purpose of setting up your account. 

_My Travel Application on Linkedin_

We allow you to share your travel information on Linkedin by installing the "[My Travel](http://www.linkedin.com/opensocialInstallation/preview?_ch_panel_id=1&_applicationId=1800)" application and then authorizing Linkedin to access your TripIt Service account. Once the application is installed, you can invite your Linkedin connections to use the same application. 

_Tell-A-Friend_

If you choose to use our referral service to invite a friend by email to our Site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend an invitation email inviting him or her to visit the Site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this invitation email and tracking the success of our referral program. 

Your friend may contact us at [support@tripit.com](mailto:support@tripit.com) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

_AddThis_

When you use AddThis to bookmark and share our products and site, you will be taken to a third party site and note that their privacy policy governs the collection and use of the information collected on those sites. You may also send your friend a one time email inviting them to visit the site from the AddThis widget. We do not collect nor store that information for any reason. 

## 2\. What Organization Is Collecting the Information

Concur Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates and manages www.tripit.com through its division, TripIt. More information about TripIt may be found at [About Us](http://www.tripit.com/press/about). 

If you use the job section of the Site, although it is co-branded as TripIt, please be aware that the collection and use of the information you enter on this page is governed by the JobScore privacy policy. JobScore shares this information back with TripIt for the sole purpose of determining your eligibility for the position in which you are applying. 

## 3\. How Your Information Is Protected

We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information and email addresses submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Current Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

## 4\. When We May Share Your Information

The information we gather is used to create and maintain your travel itineraries and your travel profile and, if you have elected to receive them, send you marketing messages on behalf of TripIt and our travel partners. We also use the information that we gather to target content on our Site to more closely match your interests and, if you have selected to receive email communication from us, target email marketing messages that are more appropriate to your needs. 

When you use the Service, the personal information you provide will be shared with the third parties you designate for access to such information including other web sites, your friends, relatives, and business associates. Depending upon the type of access you grant to such third parties, they may also be permitted to edit the information you have provided to us and to designate others to access and edit such information. You may change your settings at any time as to who has access to your information by going to your account settings and then changing your publishing options. 

Certain portions of the information you provide to us also may be displayed in your public profile. As an essential element of the services we offer, most of the personal information you explicitly provide to us when you register or update your profile is displayed on your public profile. In order for your profile to be made public you must go to your profile settings and then profile visibility. By default your profile is not for public viewing. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not put personally identifiable or other private information in your posts. Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Site, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines). 

In general, most of your travel related information, such as upcoming destinations and travel statistics, is displayed only to other users of the Service to whom you have specifically connected as part of your TripIt network. You can change your privacy settings to designate which types of information are shared and with whom by visiting the [Profile and Privacy](https://www.tripit.com/account/edit/section/your_profile) page. 

In addition, we may share your personal information as follows: 

  * When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Concur, our users, or others; and in connection with the enforcement of our User Agreement.
  * In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
  * With business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, such as a credit card processing company, email messaging providers, and SMS providers, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In situations such as this where your data is shared with a third-party firm, the firm will be contractually obligated to use your personal data only for the purpose for which our relationship with the firm exists. The firm will not have the right to share your data with other organizations or contact you outside the bounds of their contract with us.
  * As required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site… To respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Concur or others. This includes, but is not limited to, fraud, technical malfunctions, or abuse of our network or systems. We also may provide user information to third parties for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business.



From time to time, we also may share general information about our Site, users, and visitors such as the number of visitors, aggregate and/or non-personally identifiable demographic and travel data, etc., with third parties. 

Other than as set out above, you will also have the choice to authorize third party websites and mobile applications to access your travel information as part of their service to you. The reason for allowing this authorization is to make it easier for you to access your travel information on a mobile device and to more easily incorporate your travel information with your personal and professional calendars. We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties other than as described within this Privacy Policy.

You may also subscribe or unsubscribe for certain communications from us as explained in more detail in Section 6 below and in the User Agreement. Registration and login are required to access these account settings. 

## 6\. Communication You May Receive from Us

You may update your email preferences from time to time. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from promotional email messages, we may still need to contact you with important transactional information related to your account and your use of the Service. For example, even if you have unsubscribed from our email messages, we will still send you emails confirming emails relating directly to an itinerary or travel profile created through the Service confirming registration. 

You may manage the SMS alerts regarding flight delays, gate changes, and other alert information specific to your itinerary sent by the Service to your mobile device by following the opt-out instructions at the bottom of each SMS message.

## 7\. Cookies

A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie lets a computer server identify your computer. A cookie is what allows many sites to greet you upon every return with a personalized message even before you actively login. We use cookies to improve your user experience and reduce the time it takes for you to create an itinerary. Our cookies do not include any personal information, but they do help us track which of our Web pages are visited and what services are most often used.

_Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)_

Our third party advertising and analytics partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

When we post videos on our blog, third parties may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences for volume control, or to personalize certain video features. 

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:

From time to time, we may use one or more third-party advertising companies or ad networks to serve advertising on our behalf, or on behalf of third parties. Through the use of technology devices commonly referred to as cookies and action tags, a third-party ad-serving company can measure the effectiveness of our ads, including third-party ads displayed on our Site. We do not have access to a third-party ad server's cookies, (which are similar to our own cookies) or other features that advertisers and third-party Web sites may use. A third-party ad server employs an action tag (also known as a Web Beacon or a one-pixel .gif file) to set or read cookies.
