# Privacy Policy - TrialPay

## TrialPay Privacy Policy

Last modified: September 26, 2014

We at TrialPay, Inc. and the subsidiaries we own or control (collectively, "TrialPay") respect your privacy. We are publishing this version of the TrialPay Privacy Policy (the "Policy") to clearly disclose our practices and approach to data privacy and data protection.

This Policy describes how we collect, use, transfer, and safeguard information about you and your options regarding accessing or modifying such information. You accept and agree to this Policy when you visit a website on which this Policy is posted, create a TrialPay account, or interact with TrialPay's online and off-line services (collectively, our "Services").

Throughout this Policy we use the terms "personal information" and "PII" to describe information that can be associated with a specific natural person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information or PII to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it does not identify a specific natural person. If you give us PII on behalf of someone else (or someone else gives us PII on your behalf), the person providing the PII must have consent to do so from the person whose information is being provided to TrialPay.

TrialPay complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, the "Safe Harbor Principles") regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. TrialPay has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view TrialPay's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

## Safe Harbor Principles

**Notice and Choice**

TrialPay provides notice about the choices and means we offer you for limiting use and disclosure of your PII. Notice is provided in this Policy, in our web pages, and in other locations where we collect PII.

You can choose whether or not to provide your PII to us. If you choose not to provide PII, you can continue to interact with TrialPay, but you may be not be able to take advantage of certain offers, options, events and services that depend upon TrialPay having access to accurate PII. You can update your marketing communications preferences by logging into your TrialPay Online Account at [www.trialpay.com/login/](https://www.trialpay.com/login/), following the unsubscribe instructions you have received from TrialPay, or [contacting TrialPay's customer support team](https://www.trialpay.com/support/contactus/).

Please note that while TrialPay offers you some control over what marketing communication you will receive, certain transactional, relationship, and legally required communications will not be affected by the choices you have made about marketing communications.

**Onward Transfer**

We will only share your PII with third parties if we determine in our good faith judgment that those third parties provide an adequate level of data protection to help ensure the security of your personal data, such as by agreeing to abide by industry codes of conduct, the Safe Harbor Principles, or the terms of a contractual confidentiality commitment.

**Security**

We take reasonable precautions including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the PII we have collected from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. In addition, we use standard security protocols and mechanisms to transmit sensitive data such as passwords and payment information.

These safeguards are designed to protect against, but are not a guarantee against, the loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of your information.
