<p>Thank you for visiting trinidadexpress.com, a CCN Group site. Your privacy is<br>
                  important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice<br>
                  explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about<br>
                  the way your information is collected and used at this CCN Group
site.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  The Information We Collect<br>
<br>
                  At some CCN Group sites, you can order products, enter contests, vote in<br>
                  polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as<br>
                  our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or<br>
                  communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be<br>
                  collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone<br>
                  number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your<br>
                  interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  At some other CCN Group sites, you can submit information about other<br>
                  people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to<br>
                  send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent<br>
                  directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The<br>
                  types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other<br>
                  people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and<br>
                  telephone number.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  At certain parts of some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the<br>
                  requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products,<br>
                  programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and<br>
                  offerings.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you<br>
                  visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g.,<br>
                  Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g.,<br>
                  Windows '95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service<br>
                  provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  How We Use the Information<br>
<br>
                  We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests<br>
                  for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about<br>
                  our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we<br>
                  believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify<br>
                  you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our<br>
                  subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to<br>
                  contact you about your account with us.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them<br>
                  your gifts or cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to<br>
                  offer our products, programs, or services to them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  The information we collect in connection with our online forums and<br>
                  communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this<br>
                  information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities<br>
                  and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"),<br>
                  we may publish your screen name and other information you have provided to<br>
                  us.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to<br>
                  improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your<br>
                  Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to<br>
                  analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process,<br>
                  for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose<br>
                  such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Agents and contractors of CCN Group who have access to personally<br>
identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner
that<br>
is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the
information<br>
for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for<br>
CCN Group.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized<br>
                  disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable<br>
                  information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is<br>
                  inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
                  Finally, CCN Group sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable<br>
                  information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above<br>
                  without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated<br>
                  uses.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
                  Our Commitment to Security<br>
<br>
                  We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial<br>
                  procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data<br>
                  security, and correctly use the information we collect online.<br>
