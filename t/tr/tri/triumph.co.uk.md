It may be necessary on certain occasions to share your personal information outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) such as:-

  * If you are based outside the EEA; and

Whenever we do transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, we ensure a degree of protection (as stipulated by law) is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following is implemented:-

  * We will only transfer your personal data to countries who by the European Commission have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data;

If you would like further information about data transferred outside the EEA please contact the Triumph Legal and Compliance team using the details at the beginning of this notice. 

**WHAT WE DO TO KEEP YOUR DATA SECURE**

We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 

Unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is not always completely secure despite our reasonable efforts. Whilst we will reasonably protect your personal data, we do not guarantee the security of your data transmitted over the internet; any such transmission is at your own risk and when we receive your information it will be kept in a secure environment protected by a combination of physical and technical measures such as encryption technologies or authentication systems to prevent any loss, misuse, alteration, disclosure, destruction, theft or unauthorised access. 

We have in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you accordingly as well as notifying any applicable regulator where we are legally required to do so. 

**HOW LONG DO WE USE AND KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a compliant or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you. 

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. 

For the purposes of clarity in respect of your personal information the following retention periods will apply:-

  * Your name, address, contact details and VIN number will be retained for the lifetime of the motorcycle you have purchased (unless we are informed either by yourself, our dealer or the authorities of a change in ownership at which point it will only be retained for the purposes of complying with a legal obligation, resolving complaints and defending the companies legal interests)


  * Contact details provided for the purposes of marketing will be retained until you inform us that you no longer wish to receive marketing material and/or if you have not interacted with Triumph for an eighteen (18) month period. This can either be by email or by updating your choices in your personal preference centre (if applicable)



**YOUR RIGHTS**

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under the data protection laws in connection with your personal data. These are the following:-

  * Right of access to your personal data;
  * Right to request correction of your personal data;
  * Right of erasure of your personal data;
  * Right object to the processing of your personal data;
  * Right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data;
  * Right to request transfer of your personal data (data portability); and 
  * Right to object to the processing of your personal data

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. 

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights) is actioned accordingly. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one calendar month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. In the event you wish to  restrict the processing of your personal data for the purposes of (where applicable) email newsletters, service emails and/or general marketing you may use the ‘unsubscribe option’ at the bottom of any of our marketing communications to you. It may take seven (7) working days for your unsubscribe request to be fulfilled. 

**HOW TO COMPLAIN**

If you are not happy and have a data protection related complaint, please contact us directly by emailing [TriumphDataProtection@triumph.co.uk](mailto:TriumphDataProtection@triumph.co.uk) or by writing to us at Legal and Compliance Team, Triumph Motorcycles Limited, Normandy Way, Hinckley, Leicestershire, LE10 3BZ, United Kingdom.
