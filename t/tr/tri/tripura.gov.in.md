# Privacy Policy | Tripura State Portal

Thanks for visiting website of Government of Tripura, and reviewing our private policy. We collect no personal information, like names or address, when you visit our website. If you chose to provide that information to us, it is only used to fulfill your request for information. We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you (for example, to respond to your questions or provide subscriptions you have chosen). If you choose to provide us with personal information - like filling out a Feedback form, with an e-mail address or postal address, and submitting it to us through the website - we use that information to respond to your message, and to help you get the information you've requested. We only share the information you give us with another Government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Our website never collects information or creates individual profiles for commercial marketing. While you must provide an e-mail address for a localised response to any incoming questions or comments to us, we recommend that you do NOT include any other personal information.
