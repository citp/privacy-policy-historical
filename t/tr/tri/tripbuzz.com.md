Meyer Media LLC (d/b/a TripBuzz) (“TripBuzz” or “we” or “us” or “our”) recognizes the need to protect the privacy of the personal information you provide to TripBuzz with respect to your access and use of our website ( _www.tripbuzz.com_ ) and related services (the “Website”).

Therefore, we have adopted this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which sets forth, among other things, the type of information that will be collected, the purpose and use of the collected information, and your rights with regard to the collected information. This Privacy Policy governs how we collect and use your personal information wherever you use our Website. By accessing the Website, you are consenting to the collection and the use of your information by us, but only to the extent described herein. 

### Protection of Your Information

We are accountable for the information in our custody. Therefore, when we collect or use your information, we will utilize commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure its protection. It should be noted that no security procedure is currently 100% effective. Should any breach of your Personal Information occur, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible, as required by applicable law.

### Type and Purpose of Collection

We collect information at various points in the Website to facilitate its use by our users. Specifically, two types of information are collected: 

  1. _Non-Personal Information_ : Upon accessing the Website, certain non-personal information will be automatically collected without your knowledge or consent, such as your IP address, location data (which is anonymous and where you log in through the Website you will be asked if you consent to the Website accessing your location, which can be updated at any time in your device settings) and the referring website (“Non-Personal Information”). We use Non-Personal Information to examine our traffic and to view how our customers use the Website. This type of information will not allow you to be personally identified although we might be able to associate it with your account. For example, we use “cookies,” which contain only certain statistical information. For more information on cookies please find more information below. 
  2. _Identifying Personal Information_ : To utilize some portions of the Website, you must first provide personal information that will allow you to be identified, such as your name and e-mail address (“Personal Information”). This type of information will not be collected without your consent. We expressly acknowledge that we will not use your Personal Information for any other purposes without your consent. The Personal Information we collect will vary depending on how you are using the Website, but may include, without limitation: (i) your name, mailing address, phone number and email address; (ii) credit card information and charge history; (iii) unique identifiers such as user name, account number and password; (iv) preferences information such as product or content interests, communication or marketing preferences; (v) device information and data; and (vi) Google, Twitter and Facebook identity. 



Additionally, Personal Information may be used and disclosed to the extent TripBuzz may deem reasonably necessary to enforce the terms of any agreement between you and TripBuzz, or to protect the rights, property or safety of any person or entity.

When requests come to TripBuzz with regard to personal information, we ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. We retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
