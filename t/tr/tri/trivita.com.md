**Collection of Information:  
**We collect, retain and use information about you only for specific business purposes and where we reasonably believe that it will help administer our business or provide products and services to you. The information is used to protect and administer your records, and account; to comply with certain laws and regulations; and to help us design and enhance our products and services offerings so that we may provide you with quality products, services, and superior customer support. 

For research purposes, we may use such information to generate statistics including transaction patterns, but these research initiatives will never include any personally identifiable information without authorized consent. 

**Cookies:**  
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. 

Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) 

If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use The TriVita Way services that require you to "log on", and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, there may be some TriVita products and services that do not require that you accept cookies. 

**The TriVita Way uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:**

  * Access your information when you "log on", so that we can provide you   
with customized content in certain online areas. 
  * Conduct research to improve TriVita content and services. 
  * Require you to re-enter your Access Code after a certain period of  
time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents. 
  * Please note that third party usage of cookies is subject to their own privacy   
policies, not The TriVita Way privacy policy. 



**Third Parties:**  
As necessary for us to provide our services to you, The TriVita Way may provide personally identifiable information about you to a party outside our affiliated companies, such as a vendor or Business Affiliate that we pay to prepare mailings or to provide support or services for one or more of our products. These Business Affiliates and service companies agree to respect the confidentiality of such information about you and must abide by applicable law. 

**Security Measures:**  
The TriVita Way has implemented a number of security measures to protect your information. Your information is protected on secured networks and is accessible by employees who have special access rights to such systems. When you access account information, we offer the use of a secure server. Industry-standard encryption technologies are used when transferring or receiving sensitive information supplied by users. The TriVita Way updates and tests its technology to improve the protection of our information about you and to ensure the integrity of our information on a regular basis. 

**Third Party Links:**  
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visits, The TriVita Way may choose various third party web sites to link to from its own site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with The TriVita Way, The TriVita Way has no control over these linked sites, each of which may (or may not) have their own privacy policies and practices in place. The TriVita Way has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or practices or for the content of such web sites. These linked sites are for your convenience and you access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, The TriVita Way seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it and therefore it requests any feedback not only on its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific links does not work.) 

**Modifications to Privacy Policy:**  
The TriVita Way reserves the right to change the privacy policy, along with any related provisions at any time.
