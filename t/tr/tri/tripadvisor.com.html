<p class="dt1">TripAdvisor has provided this privacy policy 
because we value your right to privacy. This policy describes the types 
of information TripAdvisor gathers from its users and how that information 
is used. Please read this policy carefully before providing us with any 
personal information. If you have questions about this policy, e-mail us 
at <a href="mailto:privacy@tripadvisor.com">privacy@tripadvisor.com</a>. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="smallh">Information we collect</p>
<br>
<p class="smallh">1. Unregistered users</p>
<p><span class="dt1">We encourage you to register with us in order 
to take advantage of TripAdvisor's many personalization features. However, 
you may choose not to register and still have full access to our site. 
</span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">If you do not register, then the information 
we collect from you is limited. We log your IP address in order to help 
diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and track usage 
statistics. Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be 
the same, depending on whether you access our site through an always-on 
type of Internet connection (e.g., cable modem or DSL), or through a dial-up 
connection (e.g., AOL or Earthlink). Either way, it would be extremely 
difficult for us to identify you through your IP address, and we make 
no attempt to do so. If you reached our site by clicking on a link or 
advertisement on another site, then we also log that information. This 
helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests 
of our users. All of this information is collected and used only in the 
aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use 
it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not individual reports. 
</span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">We also place a small file known as a "cookie" 
on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows 
us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you 
have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it contains 
no personally identifiable information that would allow us to identify 
you. Cookies cannot be used to read data off of your hard drive, and cannot 
retrieve information from any other cookies created by other Web sites. 
We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors use our 
site, and to help us to improve our site. You may refuse to accept a cookie 
from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. Although 
you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting 
not only our Web site, but other Web sites as well. Since cookies don't 
provide us with any information from which we can identify you, we suggest 
you allow us to place one on your computer. </span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">If you visit our site by "clicking-through" 
from a site operated by one of our partners, and you have registered with 
that partner, then certain information about you that you have provided 
to that partner may be transmitted to us. You should review the privacy 
policy of the Web site from which you reached our site in order to determine 
what information was collected and how you agreed that our partner could 
use that information. Regardless of what information was transmitted to 
us, however, we don't keep it unless you register with us. </span> </p>
<p class="smallh">2. Registered users</p>
<p><span class="dt1">If you choose to register with us, you'll 
benefit from the ability to personalize your TripAdvisor experience. The 
benefits of registering will increase over time as we get to know you 
better. Among other things, these benefits include a personalized browsing 
experience tailored to your profile and interests. We encourage you to 
register so that you can experience everything that TripAdvisor has to 
offer!</span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">If you register with us, we will collect 
personal information from you. That information may include your name, 
mailing address, telephone number, travel preferences, user name and password. 
The information we collect may vary, but we only collect the information 
that you manually enter into our forms. We may store all or some of that 
information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will 
recognize you each time you visit our site. In that way, we can save your 
preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized Web 
site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit. 
</span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">If you visit our site by "clicking-through" 
from a site operated by one of our partners, and you have registered with 
that partner, then certain information about you that you have provided 
to that partner may be transmitted to us. You should review the privacy 
policy of the Web site from which you reached our site in order to determine 
what information was collected and how you agreed that our partner could 
use that information. We may or may not retain that information; if we 
do, then we will only use it in accordance with our privacy policy, regardless 
of the policy of the partner site from which you came to us. </span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">If you reach our site through one of our 
partners (whether or not you have registered with our partner), and you 
choose to register with us, we may be required to give our partner some 
or all of your registration information. We will only do so in accordance 
with this policy, but we cannot control how our partner uses the information. 
If you have questions about our partner's privacy policy, you should review 
their policy before providing information to us. </span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">Of course, you can ensure that the personal 
information you provide to us is not shared with our partners (except 
in accordance with this policy), by visiting us directly instead of clicking-through 
from one of our partners. </span> </p>
<p class="smallh">How we use the information we collect</p>
<p><span class="dt1">We use the information we collect to help 
both of us! As we mentioned above, registering with us allows you to personalize 
our Web site so that it is most useful to you. It also allows you to log 
into our site automatically each time you visit, rather than manually 
typing your user name and password every time. Once you have familiarized 
yourself with our Web site and all it has to offer, you may decide that 
you would like us to provide you with additional information automatically. 
For example, if you are interested in information on a particular vacation 
locale, you may want us to notify you if we locate any additional information 
about it. We would do that by sending you an e-mail. We might also use 
the information to enable us to notify you of special offers, to tell 
you about opportunities available from our partners, and for similar reasons. 
However, we will do so only if you specifically authorize us to. You can 
control whether you receive such e-mails by following the instructions 
elsewhere on this Web site, and we will make every reasonable effort to 
honor your request. We may also use the information you provide to allow 
us to contact you for administrative purposes, for example, to tell you 
about changes to our privacy policy. </span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">We may also use certain information that 
you provide in order to present you with advertising that you may find 
interesting. This benefits both of us. It benefits us because advertising 
helps pay the bills, and we can charge our advertisers more if they know 
that their ads will be seen by somebody more likely to find it useful. 
It benefits you because you see advertising that may actually be interesting 
to you, rather than annoying. </span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">You can cancel your registration with us 
by e-mailing <a href="mailto:cancel@tripadvisor.com">cancel@tripadvisor.com</a>, 
and placing your screen name in the subject of the e-mail. We will send 
you an e-mail to confirm your request. After we receive confirmation, 
we will remove your information from its active database, but some information 
may remain in our archives. We may not be able to remove your information 
from our partners' databases, if we have transmitted any information to 
them. </span> </p>
<p class="smallh">Disclosure of your information</p>
<p><span class="dt1">TripAdvisor does not sell or rent any personally 
identifiable information to any third party, other than our partners, 
as discussed in this policy. We may aggregate personal information from 
all of our users and provide that information in the aggregate to other 
parties, including advertisers, for marketing and promotional purposes. 
However, if we do so, that information will not be in a  that will 
allow any third party to identify you personally. </span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">As you might expect, TripAdvisor must cooperate 
with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose 
personally identifiable information in response to requests from law enforcement 
authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. We don't 
expect this to happen, but if it does, we will provide only the information 
required. In other words, we will not simply turn over our database in 
response to a specific legal requirement. We can also turn over information 
about you if we believe we must in order to prevent a violation of the 
law, and by accepting this policy, you consent to our doing so, in our 
sole discretion. You also consent to our disclosing information about 
you in the course of legal proceedings if we are legally required to do 
so, if we reasonably believe that doing so may mitigate our liability, 
or if doing so will assist us in enforcing our legal rights. </span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">Although at the moment, TripAdvisor has no 
related companies, we may at some point. If that should happen, then we 
may disclose the information you provide us to them, in which case we 
will request them to abide by this policy. We may also disclose some information 
to a potential acquirer, although such disclosure would be subject to 
restrictions on use.</span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">Of course, TripAdvisor will take reasonable 
measures to secure the information you provide us, using industry-standard 
methods. However, there is a remote possibility that internet transmissions 
containing your personal information may be intercepted by others. There 
is no way for us to ensure the privacy of your information before it arrives 
at our site or after it leaves our site. </span> </p>
<p><span class="dt1">We reserve the right to change this policy 
should we deem it advisable to do so. If we make significant changes, 
we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and to give 
you the opportunity to cancel your registration. </span> </p>
