**Sharing of Information**

We may share information we collect or receive in order to provide the products and services that you have requested, when we have your consent, or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. We do not rent or sell personal information to third parties.

We may share your information with service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as providing order and payment processing services, processing employment applications, or delivering marketing communications, promotional materials, or advertisements that may be of interest to you. These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. We also may share your information among our affiliates. We may share information we collect on the Online Services at your request. For example, if you use the Online Services to send information to a third party, we may identify you as the sender.

We may share information that is not reasonably identified with you for any purpose.

The Online Services may contain third party links.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those third-party websites or services.

**Do Not Track**

We do not currently support Do Not Track signals but may in the future.  Although we are not a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and do not participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program, you may wish to investigate these programs, which provide an opt-out feature where consumers can choose not to receive targeted advertising from any NAI or DAA affiliate. These links will take you to the  _[NAI opt out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp)_  and the  _[DAA opt out](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)_.

**How We Protect Information**

We maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the information you provide against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Because no information system can be fully secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.

**How We Retain Information**

We may retain information that can reasonably identify you for as long as we determine is needed for our reasonable business purposes, including to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Facebook Lead Ads**

We occasionally run lead ads on www.facebook.com, and we are committed following Facebook’s Lead Ad Terms <https://www.facebook.com/ads/leadgen/tos>. Should a Facebook user click one of our ads and choose to submit their data to us (this data includes First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone Number), the user has willingly and expressively given us the right to contact them via phone and/or email, even if they are subscribed on the Do Not Call List. Participation in these Facebook Lead Ads and the forms generated by them are voluntary and you may choose whether or not to disclose information via this format. If a user submits data to you through one of our Facebook Lead Ads, such data will be governed by this Privacy Policy.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, we will not sell Facebook Lead Ad Data under any circumstances.
