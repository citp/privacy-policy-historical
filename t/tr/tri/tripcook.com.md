### Privacy Policy

TripCook respects the privacy of all who visit TripCook.com and use our rating services.

As a prospective or current client of TripCook, you can be assured that we will carefully and consistently safeguard your information. Your name and contact information (including mailing and e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers) will only be used by TripCook to contact you and to maintain your account. Additionally, with the exception of credit card billing (please see below for more information), we will not willfully disclose to any third party any identifying information about you unless we are legally required to do so. 

As a client of TripCook, you can be further assured that all registration information we receive will be held in strictest confidence. 

TripCook uses a third party provider of credit card processing. When you sign up for our services, we may require credit card information from you. This data is forwarded on-line to our third party billing service through encrypted and protected files and is used by the service for the sole purposes of processing our request for payment. TripCook does not store your credit card information. 

TripCook may contain one or more links to other sites outside of our control which may have their own privacy policies. If you choose to utilize one of these links, you are encouraged to review their privacy policy. 

When you become a client of TripCook you agree to accept this Privacy Policy, and you acknowledge that you are aware that this policy may change at any time with or without notice.
