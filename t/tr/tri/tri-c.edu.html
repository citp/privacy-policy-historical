                                                        				                                                                                    <p>When website users access official “tri-c.edu” web pages, certain essential and nonessential technical information (collectively referred to as access information) is automatically collected. No other information is collected through our official websites except when deliberate information is sent to the College (ex., by sending the College an e-mail or providing requested information on a service website). Examples of the information a website user might choose to send the College is listed below as "optional information" (see section 2.1.2).</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Access Information (automatically collected)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The following types of information are automatically collected whenever a user accesses a page on the College’s website.</p>
<p>Client information: user's authentication information and Internet address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essential technical information: identification of the page or service a user is requesting; type of browser and operating system a user is using; and the date and time of access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonessential technical information: non-personally-identifiable aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Optional information (deliberately sent)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The College also collects information that is submitted by website users. This includes but is not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>E-mail: user’s name, e-mail address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online forms: all information/data user provides or confirms.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Cookies</strong></p>
<p>The College sometimes transfers “cookies” and “applets” to the user’s hard drive through the user’s web browser. Cookies are identifiers that are used to identify a computer, store user preferences and settings, help with sign-in and analyze site operations.</p>
<p>Important things to know about our tracking cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>No personal information is collected through these cookies.&nbsp;</li>
<li>All tracking data collected through these cookies is viewable in aggregate form only and does not disclose any personal information.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A cookie can't read data off the user’s hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites.</li>
</ul>
                                <h3 class="Clear">3.0 Use of Information</h3>
                                                        				                                                                                    <p>The College uses the obtained information to determine which sites visitors like and don't like based on traffic to those sites. The College does not track what individual visitors read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps the College provide the best services to its users.</p>
<p>The College tracks search terms entered in the search function, but it does not track which terms a particular user enters. Optional information submitted through forms may be used to provide assistance and services to website users. E-mail addresses may be used to contact individuals concerning questions or for the delivery of newsletters and other informative publications as compliant with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Sharing of Information</strong></p>
<p>The College does not divulge any information about an individual website user to a third party except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public. Users should be aware that some information collected from the <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" data-gr-id="40" id="40">College’s &nbsp;websites</g> may be subject to the Ohio Public Records Act (O.R.C § 149.43).This means that while the College does not actively share information, in some cases it may be compelled by law to release information gathered from one of its sites.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974</strong></p>
<p>The College complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), as amended, which provides students the right to access a copy of their student records; permits students with the right to contest incorrect information in their student records; and limits the release of such information without students’ explicit written consent. Student "directory information" may be released without the student's written consent.</p>
<p>Information regarding Student Education Records and FERPA is available by <a href="administrative-departments/office-of-legal-services/student-education-records-and-ferpa.html">clicking here&nbsp;[DH1]</a>. Questions regarding Student Education Records or FERPA should be directed to the Legal Services department at legal@tri-c.edu or 216-987-4856.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)</strong></p>
<p>Certain optional information submitted by users may be considered Protected Health Information (PHI). The College complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which regulates the use and disclosure of PHI.</p>
                                <h3 class="Clear">4.0 Procedures and Responsibilities</h3>
                                                        				                                                                                    <p><strong>4.1 Security</strong></p>
<p>The College strives to protect the security of the information provided by its users; however, such security measures cannot be guaranteed. The College operates secure data networks protected by industry standard and best practice. Passwords are required to access personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, contact information, class records and tuition-payment history. This information is accessible only to the individual the record pertains to and authorized College faculty and staff. The security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. The College does not guarantee the security of the information transmitted, and users utilize the site at their own risk.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Changes to the policy</strong></p>
<p>Changes in the law, in technology, and the College’s attempts to serve its users may cause this policy to be changed from time to time and without further notice. The user’s continued use of the site after any such changes constitutes their acceptance of the new terms. If the user does not agree with the new terms or any future terms, the user should not use the site. The College will use reasonable efforts to communicate any changes to this policy.</p>
