</ul>
<div><b>THE TYPE OF INFORMATION TRIABEAUTY.COM COLLECTS ABOUT YOU</b> <br>
TRIA Beauty collects information that you provide to us or that we learn about you from your use of triabeauty.com. We receive and store information you enter on TRIABeauty.com or give to us in any other way. For example, you may provide information to triabeauty.com when you register, sign in, search, add items to your shopping cart, participate in a survey, request our e-mail newsletters, or communicate with TRIA Beauty's Client Services department. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and personal shopping and product preferences. We also automatically receive and store certain types of information whenever you visit triabeauty.com. We might also receive information about you from other sources, such as in providing you special offers that we think will be of interest, and we may add that information to our account information.</div>
<div><b><br>
HOW TRIA BEAUTY USES INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</b> <br>
We use information we have collected about you to provide you with the very best health and beauty news, products and services, and shopping experience. We do not sell your personal information to third parties for any reason. We do not disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties who may want to offer you their own products and services unless you have requested or authorized us to do so.</div>
<div>We may share your personal information with third parties or affiliates of TRIA Beauty where it is necessary for us to complete a transaction or do something you have asked us to do.</div>
<div>We may share your personal information to third parties or affiliates of TRIA Beauty with whom we have contracted to perform services on our behalf. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep the personal information we provide to them confidential and to use the personal information we share only to provide the services we ask them to perform.</div>
<div>We may disclose personal information about our customers as permitted or required by law, such as in connection with a subpoena or similar legal process, or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, as discussed further below.</div>
<div>We try to provide you with the information you need to make informed, reasonable choices with respect to how triabeauty.com uses or shares your information. TRIA Beauty collects and uses personal information from you in several ways:</div>
<div><b><br>
WEBSITE USAGE</b> <br>
TRIA Beauty or its authorized service providers may observe activities, preferences and transactional data (such as your IP address, browser type and operating system) relating to your use of triabeauty.com. We may use this collected or logged information in order to provide better service, to facilitate our customers' use of the website, to track usage of the website, and to address security hazards. TRIA Beauty, or its authorized service providers, may use this information to track aggregate traffic patterns throughout triabeauty.com. We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our customer audience, products, and services, and to develop partnerships with third parties to offer products and services in which we believe our customers will be interested.</div>
<div><b><br>
ONLINE TRANSACTIONS</b> <br>
We collect information about you when you use our website. To open an account with us, you will need to provide us with certain information, including your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. If necessary, we will assist you in creating a user ID and a password to protect your account information. At this time, when you request to purchase items in your shopping cart, we will forward your request and basic account information to the e-commerce service provider. When you provide personal financial and other personally identifiable information to the service providers featured through triabeauty.com, the sales transaction will occur on the service provider's site and not on triabeauty.com. As such, the financial and personally identifiable information you provide in placing your order is controlled by that service provider.</div>
<div><b><br>
OUR SECURITY PRACTICES</b> <br>
Our internal data security policies restrict access to customers' personal information to authorized employees. Authorized employees may use our customers' personal information for TRIA Beauty business purposes only. Our employees are bound by TRIA Beauty policies that require them to maintain the confidentiality of our customers' personal information. Employees who violate these requirements are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</div>
<div>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to guard our customers' personal information. For example, for the security of your online visit to triabeauty.com, we may make use of firewall barriers, encryption techniques, and/or authentication procedures. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, TRIA Beauty cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information, we will notify you as necessary so you can take appropriate protective steps. Unless you indicate otherwise, we may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address you provided to us when you registered with triabeauty.com.</div>
<div><b><br>
WHAT ARE COOKIES AND HOW DOES TRIABEAUTY.COM USE THEM?</b> <br>
We may use cookies to collect or log certain information. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website stores on a personal computer and which it can later retrieve. We may use cookies for some administrative purposes, for example, to store our customers' preferences for certain kinds of products or to store a password so that you do not have to input it every time you visit our website. The cookies will not contain information that will enable anyone to contact our customers via telephone, email, or any other means. If our customers are uncomfortable with the use of cookie technology, they can set their browsers to refuse cookies. Certain services, however, could be dependent on cookies and our customers may disable those services by refusing cookies.</div>
<div><b><br>
LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES AND WEBSITES CONTAINING TRIABEAUTY.COM BRANDING</b> <br>
triabeauty.com may contain links to third-party sites. Please be aware, however, that TRIA Beauty is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy policies of these other sites or their practices. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other sites, as they may differ from ours.</div>
<div>This website may also contain links to sites that display triabeauty.com branding and/or TRIA Beauty's logo but which are maintained by third parties. Such websites may be identified in that they do not display a triabeauty.com URL. Please read the privacy policy on these sites for applicable privacy practices relating to personal information collected via those sites because they may differ from triabeauty.com's privacy practices. This Privacy and Security Policy applies solely to personal information collected by TRIA Beauty.</div>
<div><b><br>
CONTACT PREFERENCES AND ACCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b> <br>
You have choices when it comes to how TRIA Beauty uses your personal information. When you register online with triabeauty.com, you can choose not to receive information about merchandise, services and special promotional offers from us by direct mail and/or e-mail. If you elect not to receive such product marketing information by direct mail or e-mail, TRIA Beauty may continue to contact you as necessary to service your account. You can change your contact preferences at any time by following the instructions on triabeauty.com.</div>
<div>Keeping your account information accurate and up-to-date is very important so we can provide you with excellent service. If your account information is incomplete, inaccurate, or not current, please follow the instructions on triabeauty.com to correct your account information online.</div>
<div><b><br>
THIS PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY APPLIES TO U.S. CUSTOMERS</b> <br>
triabeauty.com is hosted in the United States and is intended for U.S. visitors.</div>
<div>This Privacy and Security Policy applies to customer relationships established in the United States. Parts of this Privacy and Security Policy may not apply to visitors outside the United States. Like almost every website, triabeauty.com may be accessed by an international audience. If you are a non-U.S. visitor to our website, by visiting our website and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes identified in this Privacy and Security Policy. In addition, such data may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction, which may have less stringent privacy practices than your own. By providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of such data.</div>
<div><b><br>
MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, AND BANKRUPTCY</b> <br>
If TRIA Beauty should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if TRIA Beauty should decide to buy another business, or sell or reorganize part or all of TRIA Beauty's business, TRIA Beauty may be required to disclose your personal information to prospective or actual purchasers and other parties. It is TRIA Beauty's practice to obtain appropriate protections for information disclosed in these types of transactions. TRIA Beauty cannot, however, guarantee that TRIA Beauty's Privacy and Security Policy will remain unchanged if TRIA Beauty is sold or merges with another company.</div>
<div><b><br>
TRIABEAUTY.COM IS NOT FOR USE BY CHILDREN</b> <br>
Children are not eligible to use triabeauty.com. We ask that minors (under the age of 18) only use triabeauty.com in conjunction with parents or guardians. Children under 13 should not send any information about themselves to TRIA Beauty. If a child under 13 submits information through any part of triabeauty.com, and TRIA Beauty becomes aware that the person submitting the information is a child, we will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under 13, we do not use or disclose such information to third parties.</div>
<div><b><br>
WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT MY PRIVACY?</b> <br>
You should be careful to maintain the secrecy of your passwords and/or account information and be responsible about protecting your personal information and identity whenever you are online.</div>
<div><b><br>
