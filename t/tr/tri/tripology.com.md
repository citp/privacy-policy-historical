# Privacy Policy for Travel Consumers | Tripology.com

## Privacy Policy

This is the Privacy Policy Statement for Tripology, a service of RM Acquisition, LLC d/b/a Rand McNally ("Tripology")

At Tripology your trust and satisfaction is of the utmost importance. Because we respect your privacy, we have instituted policies intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.

This Privacy Policy Statement applies only to information collected through Tripology’s website. We suggest that you review this Privacy Policy Statement periodically as we may update it from time to time. This Policy was last revised on March 23, 2010. Capitalized terms are as defined in the Terms of Service Between Travel Consumer and Tripology and the Terms and Conditions Between Travel Professional and Tripology which are available on Tripology’s website at http://www.tripology.com. 

## What is the site's policy regarding public forums?

We may from time to time make available forums available to you and may request you to submit feedback, reviews and ratings with respect to your experiences in using our services and those of the Travel Agents and/or Travel Suppliers matched with your Trip Request. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. Do we provide links to other websites? We may from time to time make available links to other websites available to you. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

## Third party merchants "Presented by Tripology"

If you make a purchase from a Merchant Site with a link originating from the Tripology site or a Merchant catalog or website "presented by" Tripology, the information you provide to that Merchant, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to the Merchant and not to Tripology. Providing this information to the Merchant enables the transaction to take place. However, you should know that the Merchant may, if you do not advise them to the contrary, share your name and postal and email addresses with third parties, including Tripology. You should also know that these Merchants have their own privacy and data collection practices and are not covered by the Tripology Privacy Policy Statement. 

Merchants on the Tripology site and those Merchants who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Tripology have separate privacy and data collection practices. We have no control over and therefore no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding Merchants appearing on Tripology or other Merchants who send catalogs or host websites "presented by" Tripology and their privacy policies, please see the Merchant's home page and click on their Information link or review the customer service section of any catalog you may receive from the Merchant.

Merchants that have links on the Tripology site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of these Merchants are not covered by the Tripology Privacy Policy Statement.

If a Child submits information to us through any part of our Website, and we know that the person submitting the information is a Child, we delete the information as soon as we discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to third parties. If your Child has submitted personal information to us and you would like to request that such information be removed from our customer lists, you may contact us using the “contact us” information listed below, and we will honor your request.

## Conflict in terms 

It is our goal to make our privacy practices easy to understand. We have created this easy-to-read Privacy Policy Statement with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our Privacy Policy Statement into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary". It is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the Privacy Policy Statement upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our Privacy Policy Statement. For this reason, you should rely on our Privacy Policy Statement as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.
