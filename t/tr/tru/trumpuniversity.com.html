Additionally, we exercise great care in providing safe transmission of your information  from your PC to our servers (unless sent by a means outside of our control, such as e-mail).</p>  <p>Please read this policy carefully. We may need to change this policy from time to time in order to address  new issues and reflect changes on our sites. We will post those changes here so that you will always know  what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose that information  to anyone. Please refer back to this policy regularly.</p>  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please send an e-mail to: <a href="mailto:info@trumpuniversity.com">info@trumpuniversity.com</a>.</p>  <h4>How We Protect Your Personal information</h4>  <p>We may request personal identification information from you (such as your name, street address,  telephone number, credit card number, e-mail address, and/or any other identifier that permits the  physical or online contacting of you) in connection with your use of, or participation in, membership  registration, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, chats, bulletin boards, discussion groups,  or additional information (including via email to us), and in connection with other activities,  services or resources we make available on any of our sites.

Except as otherwise provided in this policy, we will never intentionally disclose any personal identification  information about you as an individual user to any third party without having received your permission.</p>  <p>If you do provide us with personal information for any of these activities, we may use it to conduct  the activity.

In addition, in the event your personally  identifiable information is requested as part of our surveys or polls, such personally identifiable  information may be added to your registration information).</p>  <p>We may use your personal data in the following ways:<br>  --For the purpose for which you specifically provided the personal data, for example to enroll you in one of our courses, to    process your order of one of our books or other materials, or to respond to a specific inquiry; <br>  --To send surveys or questionnaires so that we can learn more about our customers' needs and interests;    --Unless you opt out, to send you our online newsletter, "Inside Trump University." <br>  --Unless you opt out, to send you information about new products or services that we think might interest you.</p>  <p>If you do not want us to send you surveys and questionnaires, or to provide you with information about our other  products and services, you can opt out of receiving this information at any time.</p>  <p>We will release specific information about you or your account to comply with any valid legal inquiry or process  such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order.
