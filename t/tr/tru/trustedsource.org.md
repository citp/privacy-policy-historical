# Privacy Policy: Secure Computing

Secure Computing Corporation has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our Website visitors. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for the Secure Computing Websites at: [www.securecomputing.com](http://www.securecomputing.com/) and [partner.securecomputing.com](https://partner.securecomputing.com/). 

_**Website Registration Forms**_  
Our site is designed to require you to complete a registration form if you are interested in obtaining additional information or products from us. Therefore, registration forms may require you to give us contact information (like your name, email, and postal address). 

Secure Computing does not engage in the practice of selling or distributing contact information to other companies. 

Contact information from our registration forms is used to send requested product information and promotional material to prospects. Sometimes the mailings are handled by a third party fulfillment house that requires access to the information on registration forms in order to send you requested materials. In addition, contact information is sometimes shared with authorized Secure Computing value added resellers who are designated by Secure Computing to follow up with the prospective customer. 

**_Supplementation of Information_**  
This site sometimes supplements the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. For instance, if inaccurate address information is received, we may use third party software to fix such erroneous items. 

**_Choice/Opt-Out_**  
You can send email to [webmaster@securecomputing.com](mailto:webmaster@securecomputing.com) to be removed from any email or standard mail lists. Please specify from which list you wish to be removed when sending the email. 

_**WebSite Information Logging**_  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Website. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as determining how many of our visitors are from different parts of the world. 

We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (ie: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics. Secure Computing Corporation does not extract any personal information (eg: email addresses or names) that may be contained in a Web browser's user preference file. 

**_Cookies_**  
Our Site may use cookies to track the length of time you spend on the site, or to store frequently used user information to personalize your online experience. For some users, cookies are used with the SafeWord® Web Access Authentication Agent. 

**_External Links_**   
This site contains links to other sites. Secure Computing is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Websites. 

**_Security_**  
Secure Computing receives information via online applications. Many of these applications may ask for sensitive data and require industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted browsers. We use 128-bit encryption, the most powerful available, to protect transmissions over the Internet. 

**_Changes to Privacy Policy_**  
If we decide to change our privacy and/or security policies, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
