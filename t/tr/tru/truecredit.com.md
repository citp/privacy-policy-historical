# Understand Your Credit Report | TrueCredit

##  Security 

TrueCredit understands the confidentiality of information contained in credit reports, and we safeguard the privacy of all information you provide to this Web Site. 

###  Identity Verification (IV) 

TrueCredit has designed an Identity Verification System in order to protect your security and privacy. IV seeks to confirm that your personal credit report is being viewed by YOU. 

When a customer requests a credit report, IV is intended to confirm the customer's identity. If you cannot provide the correct information, the system does not allow you to view the report. (Please Note: If you are currently in the identity verification process and you need help, please contact our Customer Service Team). 

###  SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Encryption 

To ensure that your credit information remains secure and confidential, TrueCredit uses programs that encrypt the data you provide on the order form before transmission to TrueCredit. 

Encryption is a way of coding the information in a file so that, if it is intercepted by a third party as it travels over a network, it cannot be read. Only the person or persons that have the right type of decoding software can unscramble the message. Thus, your encrypted information can only be read by TrueCredit.

##  TrueCredit Privacy Statement

Last updated August 12, 2013 

###  The Information We Collect from You 

TrueCredit allows you to access the TrueCredit product through our Web site. We collect your personal information only if you decide to purchase TrueCredit, subscribe to our newsletter, or surveys or transact other business with us. In order to process your transactions and provide you with quality customer service, we need your full name and current and/or billing address, your email address (so we can contact you) and, if you purchase one of our products, a valid credit card number, your Social Security number and certain other personal information, such as your date of birth, address information, employment information, and certain credit card and loan account information. We use personal information to authenticate the credit card number and to confirm that the person requesting your credit report as part of TrueCredit really is you and not an impostor or other person improperly seeking to access your information. 

###  What Security Measures We Take 

TrueCredit takes precautions to secure your personal information. If and when we ask you to provide your personal information, we will do so through a Web page that uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. This protocol provides security for your information by encrypting it as it travels from your computer to our computer. We then move all of the personal information that we collect or obtain about you, including your credit report, to a special computer for security purposes by means of a one-way transfer on our proprietary network. This special computer is not connected to the Internet, and TrueCredit has controls in place to limit access to and secure the data maintained therein. 

###  How We Use and Share Your Personal Information 

If you indicate to us that you are interested in receiving information regarding other products and services from TrueCredit and third party partners, your name, e-mail address and other registration information may be shared with a third party in order to present these offers to you. Personal information that is shared with these entities will be monitored in accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. If you prefer not to receive such information, you may indicate your preference by marking the appropriate box when you register, place an order or update your account information, and TrueCredit will not send you any promotional materials. 

###  Emails 

When you order TrueCredit, we will email you a receipt of your purchase. The TrueCredit product also includes alert emails that are sent on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. These emails are part of the TrueCredit benefits and cannot be disabled for persons who are TrueCredit members. 

###  Ordering 

When you order TrueCredit or other product or service, TrueCredit must share some of your personal information with third parties in order to process your transaction. For example, TrueCredit must share your name, address and social security number with one or more of the major credit reporting agencies in order to obtain your requested credit reports, and must share your name, address and credit card account number with our credit card processing partner in order to process your payment. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

###  Third Parties 

If you indicated to us when you registered, placed an order or updated your account that you were interested in receiving information about products and services provided by TrueCredit, and its third party marketing partners your name, email address and other registration information may be shared with a third party in order to present these offers to you. These entities are only allowed to use shared information for the intended purpose only and will be monitored in accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. In the event you indicate that you want to receive personalized offers from TrueCredit based on information from your credit profile, your credit information may be used to serve relevant ads to you when you visit the site and provide other relevant offers from TrueCredit based on such information. TrueCredit also may disclose your personal information to third parties in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with, or be responsive to, legal process served on us (such as a subpoena), or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of TrueCredit, our users or others. In addition, we may disclose your personal information to consultants, agents and advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is within the scope of their professional duties to TrueCredit and with the understanding that such professionals will abide by our security and confidentiality policies. In the event that you unsubscribe from email communications, we may share your email address with our compliance agents or approved marketing partners to prevent you from receiving additional offers. 

###  The Collection of Anonymous Data 

In order to enhance the usefulness of our Web site and our products and services, TrueCredit will collect data about our customers' use of our Web site, in a manner that does not include any personally identifiable information. While you browse the TrueCredit Web site, we note which pages of our site you visit and note the IP address of your computer (as all Web sites do automatically), but we do not link that address information to your personal information for marketing purposes but may for the purpose of product delivery. The general information we gather enables us to serve our customers better by continually enhancing our site based on up-to-date use patterns. 

###  Information Regarding Your Subscription 

We may use information about your TrueCredit subscription, such as your usage patterns, to customize your web site and/or customer service experience. 

###  Updating Your Personal Information and Email Preferences 

TrueCredit is not responsible for and cannot amend the information in your credit report, which is produced by one or more credit reporting agencies. If you believe that some of the information in your credit report is inaccurate, you must contact the applicable credit reporting agency directly. 

###  Notification of Changes to this Privacy Statement 

TrueCredit may amend this Privacy Statement at any time, and without advance notice. We recommend that from time to time you review this Privacy Statement to check for changes. 

###  Possible Acquisition 

In the event of an acquisition of all or part of TrueCredit by another company, or in the event that TrueCredit were to sell or dispose of all or a part of the business, the acquirer would have access to the information maintained by the TrueCredit business, which could include your personal information, subject to applicable law. The acquirer's privacy policy might be different than TrueCredit's privacy policy, or the acquirer might choose to amend TrueCredit's privacy policy. You will be notified by email if, as a result of such acquisition, TrueCredit's privacy policy is materially changed or if the acquirer's privacy policy is materially different than TrueCredit's privacy policy. In connection with such notice, you will be given an opportunity to inform the acquirer that you do not consent to the use or disclosure by the acquirer of your personal information in accordance with such new or revised privacy policy.
