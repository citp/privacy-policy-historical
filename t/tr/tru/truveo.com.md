# Truveo Privacy Policy - Truveo Video Search

This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect about you at [www.truveo.com](http://www.truveo.com/) (the "Website") and how we use this information. This policy does not apply to information about you collected by our affiliated providers, such as, AOL.com, or third party Web sites and offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from Truveo. The information collected or received by our affiliated providers and these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies. 

**Collection of your Truveo Information**

Your "Truveo information" includes certain technical information gathered or received when you use Truveo. Some of the technical information that may be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), CPU type, your manner of connecting to the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband access); Internet protocol address; information about the version of service from an affiliate that you used prior to registering with the service; other information about your geographic location; and the domain name of your Internet service provider. 

While registering to use most of the Truveo services is not required, there are a limited number of optional services (for example, saving a video list) that require an "account". Registration functionality for Truveo is provided by the AOL Network. If you choose to "Get an Account", you will need to register with and provide information to the AOL Network. You will then obtain a Screen Name or other credential issued by the AOL Network (collectively, "Screen Name") in order to access and use these optional services, and your Screen Name and associated services account will be subject to the [AOL Network Registered User Agreement](http://about.aol.com/aolnetwork/terms_use) and [Privacy Practices](http://about.aol.com/aolnetwork/aol_pp) indicated in your registration process. 

If you are an AOL Member, registration is not required in order to access the optional Truveo services that require an account. Use of Truveo Services by AOL members is subject to the [AOL Member Privacy Policy](http://about.aol.com/aolnetwork/mem_policy). 

**How Your Truveo information is Used**

Your Truveo information is used 

  * to operate and improve the websites, services and offerings available through Truveo;
  * to personalize the content provided to you;
  * to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services;
  * to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries;
  * to conduct research about your use of Truveo; and
  * to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest.

  
Your Truveo information will not be shared with third parties unless it is necessary to fulfill a request, in other circumstances in which you have consented to the sharing of your Truveo information, or except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may use your Truveo information to present offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These business partners and advertisers receive aggregate data about groups of Truveo users, but do not receive information that personally identifies you. 

If you use our communications tools to disclose information about yourself publicly (for example, by making your screen name and/or video lists publicly available), other online users may obtain access to any information you provide. The contents of your online communications, as well as other information about you as a Truveo user, may be accessed and disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe Truveo is being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; or when necessary either to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of our affiliated providers, or for us to render the service you have requested. We may use agents and contractors in order to help operate the service. If such agents and contractors have access to your Truveo information, they are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Truveo. 

In the event that ownership of us or the Truveo service was to change as a result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your Truveo information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your Truveo information, we will provide notice about the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer. 

**Your Choices About Your Information**

If you want to change your account information (for example, your Screen Name) you will need to log onto the AOL Network. Your access to your account information and choice will be governed by the AOL Network policies. 

**Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies**

Cookies are text files that are placed in your computer's browser, and that can be used to help recognize you as a Truveo user. Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on Web pages that can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit that Web page, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing that page. You can control cookies through your browser's settings. If you reject all cookies, however, you will not be able to take advantage of certain Truveo offerings.

Truveo and its advertisers may use advertising network providers to help present advertisements on Truveo. These advertising networks may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer in order to provide targeted advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you while visiting other Web sites. Truveo may share certain non-personally identifiable information about you as a Truveo user with certain ad network providers help them deliver more relevant advertisements through their ad networks.
