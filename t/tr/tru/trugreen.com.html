<h2><a name="InformationCollect"></a>Information The TruGreen Companies collects and how it is used</h2>

<p>The TruGreen Companies collects certain information to enable you  to take full advantage of our offerings when you register at our site,  order products or services, participate in our contests, surveys,  promotions, or activities, or otherwise communicate with us.

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>When you register with The TruGreen Companies, we require you to give us contact information (such as your name, e-mail address, and physical address).</p>

<p>We may require additional information for specific promotions or  contests run on our site. </p>

<p>We use the customer contact information we collect to connect you  with a service provider, and to send you, if you so choose, information  about our company, newsletters, promotional materials, and information  from the service provider network. </p>

<p>We may also use the information we collect, in combination with  outside records, to notify you about important changes to the website,  new TruGreen Companies services and products, and special offers  and information we think you’ll find valuable. We may send you information in conjunction with third-party partners  that we think is relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>We use information gathered at the time of purchase to process your  order, to enable the provider to fulfill your order, and to notify  you of your order status. A customer care representative or service  provider may contact you in order to fulfill a service you purchased  or to provide information you requested. </p>

<h3>Non-personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about  you when you visit our site, such as the type of browser you are  using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating  system you are using, the referring site from which you came (e.g.,  a partner site), and the domain name of your internet service provider  (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). </p>

<p>We use the non-personally identifiable information  that we collect in the aggregate to improve the design and content  of our site. We also use this information to analyze site usage. </p>

<h2><a name="disclose"></a>Disclosure of information to outside parties</h2>
<p>To process your requests for products or services, we will need  to share some of the personally identifiable information you provided  (e.g., contact information and information about particular service  needs) with service providers in the provider network.</p>

<p>If you choose to receive promotions, newsletters, and/or other  types of correspondence from us, the correspondence that you receive  will originate from The TruGreen Companies or the provider network,  and your personally identifiable information will continue to be  solely maintained by The TruGreen Companies.</p>

<p>If you registered with The TruGreen Companies through a third-party  website or if you registered with a third-party website through  The TruGreen Companies, we may need to report certain information  to that website, as is necessary.</p>

<p>If you come to The TruGreen Companies via a co-branded partner  and transact business with us, the information you provide may be  collected and used by The TruGreen Companies, as well as by the  co-branded partner from which you came.

The TruGreen Companies will disclose information to such agencies  in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith that  the law requires it, for example, in response to a court order,  subpoena, or a law enforcement agency’s request.</p>

<p>Finally, The TruGreen Companies may provide aggregate statistics  about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information  to reputable third-party vendors, partners, service providers, or  to the press. Aggregate statistics contain only non-personally identifiable  information. </p>

<h2><a name="ThirdParty"></a>Information partners collect</h2>
<p>Our site contains links to other websites whose information practices  may be different than ours. You should consult the other sites’  privacy policies, as we have no control over information that you  may submit or that the third parties collect on those sites.</p>

<p>We may offer promotions or content that is sponsored by, or co-branded  with, identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships,  these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information  that you submit. The TruGreen Companies has no control over the  third party’s use of this information.&nbsp; </p>

<h2><a name="Protection"></a>Commitment to the security of your information</h2>
<p>When you place orders or access your account information, we use  a secure server. The secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets  Layer), encrypts all information you input before it is sent to  us. Furthermore, digital certificates protect all of the customer  transactional data we collect against unauthorized access.

Additionally, we use firewall security and limit data access to  protect your personally identifiable information.</p>
