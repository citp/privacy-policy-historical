  Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself by signing-up for the Services, you remain anonymous. Cookies come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.

We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.

  Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, invisible GIFs, web bugs, or action tags, may be used to assist in delivering the cookies on the Website. This technology tells us how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a page.
