**To Whom Does This Policy Apply?**

Some parts of this Policy are directed at specific types of people. We use some special terminology to refer to them, which we define below. This Policy applies to everyone who uses our Services, but sometimes we direct parts of it toward particular groups of users. 

_Users:_ "Users" are everyone who uses our Services. 

_Real Estate Professionals (REPs):_ "Real Estate Professionals," or "REPs" are users who have created accounts (free or paid) with us to sell or rent real estate, participate in our advertising services, and participate in other Services that we direct toward the professional real estate community. REPs include landlords, agents, mortgage professionals and subscribers (described further below). We send leads to REPs on your behalf, as described in this Policy. 

_Subscribers:_ "Subscribers" are REPs who participate in our paid subscription plans, like Trulia Pro. Subscribers, like all REPs, get leads from us, but they also may receive third-party augmented information as described in this Policy.

**How We Share Your Information**

_Personally Identifiable Information:_ We will only share your personally identifiable information at your direction (e.g., when you request to contact a REP using our Services) and according to this Policy's terms. 

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_ : In order to provide and improve our Services and to share relevant ads with you, we use and disclose to our advertising and analytics partners non-personally identifiable information that we collect, including cookie data, some log data, and mobile data. We also share anonymous profiles of users who view a property with REPs. We will never re-identify non-personally identifiable information by combining it with personally identifiable information. 

Some of our Services require that you opt into additional sharing: 

_Direct Contact with a REP_ : If you fill out a form to contact a REP (or use any other contact forms available on our Sites) or call a REP via our mobile site or app, we may share personally identifiable information that you share with us and information about your use of our Services with the party you wanted to contact. This may include data you input such as home search criteria or Log Data that we collect as you use the Services. If a REP wants to contact you based on the anonymized profile of Trulia pages you visited, we will contact you to see if we can make that connection. Sometimes, if we are working with a third party to improve the leads we provide to our subscriber REPs, we may provide that third party with additional but limited personally identifiable information for the sole purpose of their carrying out their duty to us. 

_Mortgage Services:_ If you request a mortgage quote using our services, you authorize us to share the personally identifiable information necessary for our partners to deliver the service. They are not permitted to use the information for any other purpose. 

_Referrals:_ If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Site. Trulia stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. Your friend may contact us at [customerservice@trulia.com](mailto:customerservice@trulia.com) to request that we remove this information from our database. 

_Facebook Custom Audiences and Promotions:_ If you have not opted out of email communications with us, we will use your email address (and Facebook ID, if we have collected it) to promote Trulia content to you via Facebook's Custom Audiences feature and other Facebook advertising or promotional tools. The Custom Audiences feature allows us to reach out to our users via Facebook if those users have already shared their email addresses or Facebook IDs with us. 

We do not allow anyone else to access the user lists we use for Facebook promotions, and Facebook itself will never receive any of our users' data. (Facebook receives a hash, a kind of digital fingerprint, of our users' data in order to make a match on its own servers, but they never receive any actual data.) If you do not want to receive promotions as part of our Custom Audiences campaigns, unsubscribe from our email list via one of the emails you receive from us, and we will remove you from our Custom Audiences list within 7 days. 

_Social Sharing:_ When you use any social sharing function we may provide to share our products and Site (e.g., sharing on Facebook), your sharing activity will be processed through a third party's site or service. These third parties' privacy policies, not ours, govern the collection and use of the information collected on those sites. 

_User-Generated Content:_ If you use our user-generated content services, like posting a question, answer or blog on this Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

Professionals may add testimonials to their own profiles on Trulia. They are responsible for obtaining consent to publish any personal information of those persons who submit said testimonials to them. 

We may post user content, including testimonials and reviews, on our website. Some of it may contain personally identifiable information. We obtain customers' consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their names along with their testimonial. 

If you want to remove your personal information that is being displayed on our website under public pages, please contact us at [customerservice@trulia.com](mailto:customerservice@trulia.com).

Website _Third-Party Ad Services:_ We use third-party ad services to deliver ads to you on our Services. These third-party ad servers may collect and use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Services in order to present advertisements that may be of interest to you.
