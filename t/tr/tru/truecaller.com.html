            </header>
            <p>
                In Truecaller´s mission to build the most accurate and complete phone community accessible to anyone, anywhere across the globe, Truecaller is depending on
                the Users sharing certain information. Being a collaborative community the top-priority of Truecaller will always be the relationship with its community.
            Truecaller is therefore firmly committed to the security and protection of the personal integrity of the Users of the Services (as defined in the <a href="/terms-of-service"><u>Terms of Service</u></a>) and their contacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes what personal information You may share with Truecaller, as data controller, and other Users when activating and using the
                Truecaller Services, how Truecaller receives, collects and uses this data and how You may opt-out at any time, altogether preventing use of the data shared
                via the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Information Collected and Received</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Installation</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you install the Truecaller App, Truecaller will collect some technical information from Your device in order to be able to provide You with the
                Services, namely Your IP address, the unique device ID number and what operating system, operator, screen resolution and version of the Truecaller App You
                use. This information is used to verify that the User device is properly registered and will not be used to identify You personally or be transferred to
                third parties. We will, however, use this data for statistics and user support as long as You use the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
            For details regarding permission usage in connection with installation on the Android platform, please see the Truecaller FAQ at <a href="http://www.truecaller.com/support">www.truecaller.com/support</a> .
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>User Profile</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Where the User registers a user profile in the Truecaller App and via an sms or inbound call verification confirms being the holder of a certain number,
                the information up-loaded to the profile section of the Truecaller App will be received and stored by Truecaller until the User changes or deletes such
                data or terminates the Services. Compulsory information when creating a profile page is the User’s first name, last name and phone number and additional
                information that may be provided at the User’s option include, but is not limited to, photo, gender, street address and zip code, county of residence,
                email address, professional website, Facebook page, Twitter address and a short status message.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that the User personally is responsible for any Content up-loaded to and displayed in the user profile.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Identifiers</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, You may provide us with Your user identifier information regarding certain third party services, i.e. Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter,
                necessary for the application to interoperate with such third party services. In that case Truecaller will store and process also that information (and
                also a mapped photo where applicable), for as long as You use the Services and will not use this information for any other purpose than required in order
                to obtain interoperability and functionality in relation to such third party services. Please note that we never store any passwords to the mentioned third
                party services.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Contact Information</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Where the Truecaller App is obtained from other sources than Apple App Store or Google Play, You may share the names and numbers contained in Your device’s
                address book (“Contact Information”) with Truecaller for the purpose described below under <em>Enhanced Search</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where the Truecaller App is obtained from Apple App Store or Google Play, we will only use Contact Information for the sole purpose of recognizing and
                recommending You to people You may know within the Truecaller community.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to Contact Information, if You choose to activate use of a third party Social Network Service, such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIN or Twitter,
                within the Truecaller App, Truecaller may up-load, store and use the list of identifiers associated with said services linked to the Contact Information in
                order to enhance the results shared with other Users.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    Please note that no other Contact Information than the phone numbers and thereto attached names will be received, stored and used from the User’s
                    address book. Other numbers or information that may be contained in your device’s phone book will be filtered away and will therefore <u>not</u> be
                    stored or used by Truecaller. Addresses, passwords and credit card numbers and any other similar information will automatically be prevented from being
                    entered into the Truecaller database by our safety algorithms, that filters any numbers and other information stored in the phone book in a number
                    sequence not compatible with that used for telephone numbers. Please also note that You can always <u>choose</u> not to share Contact Information with
                    Truecaller and if You have shared information and changed Your mind, You can easily delist Your number or opt-out to render your entire Contact
                    Information unavailable for search in the database for Enhanced Search.
                </em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Call Block</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Where a User within the Services reports a phone number as spam, Truecaller stores that phone number in combination with the User’s RegisterID in order to
                maintain the User’s spam list online but also for the purpose of building a community based spam blocking directory. On the Android platform, the User can
                also add a name to the phone number in question that will only be visible to that User.<em></em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Use, Sharing and Disclosure of User and Contact Information</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Information related to the User or Contact Information will only be used to
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) display the name associated with a certain number at a manual number search against the Truecaller database,
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) automatically display the caller’s name when a call is received, as enabled by the Enhanced Search functionality, as described below, to Users who have
                activated that functionality, and indicate possible mutual contact points with the caller or when an incoming call may be spam,
            </p>
            <p>
                (c) “update phonebook” and display the “who viewed my profile” functionalities of the Services,
            </p>
            <p>
                (d) provide limited API for queries against the Truecaller database for a selected number of Truecaller partners,
            </p>
            <p>
                (e) enable the Truecaller Name Search, as described below, to Users who have activated that functionality, and
            </p>
            <p>
                (f) contact You from Truecaller for verification purposes or with information pertaining to the Services, e g newsletter e-mails and similar notifications.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Enhanced Search functionality and database</em>
                <br>
                To improve the Services, Truecaller has created a searchable database where the Users generate the content and via the Enhanced Search functionality are
                offered access to this database, containing Contact Information from those Users who permit such aggregation. In return these Users are allowed to access
                to the database by querying it. Queries against the database are only allowed through the Truecaller Services by Users who have explicitly approved of the
                Service's functionality and integrity restrictions as contained in the <a href="/terms-of-service"><u>Truecaller Terms of Service</u></a>, the <a href="/api-license-addendum"><u>API License Addendum</u></a> and this Privacy
                Policy. <em></em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The queries against the Truecaller Enhanced Search database are processed only if a numeric phone number is attributed to the query and only if no results
                are published by an associated or partnering database of Truecaller. The response given to the queried number will be the associated name to that number,
                if any name is available.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    It is important to notice the following distinctions. As an integrity and security measure, only numeric queries are allowed against the Truecaller
                    database for Enhanced Search, i e there will be no result to a name query. Name searches may, however, give result via the Services if a partnering or
                    associated database to Truecaller has numbers available to the name queries. The Users contributing to Enhanced Search can therefore rely on that the
                    Contact Information provided, as a personal integrity precaution, will not enable anyone searching for the number to a certain person direct access to
                    that number. In some cases, Users may, however, use the Services to forward a request to a named person in order to get in touch, please see below
                    about the Truecaller Name Search service.
                </em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The database may also – via a “social graph” algorithm - be used to show the User how many other Users that he or she has in common with another User and
                to suggest other contacts they may have in common. Please note that, if You are presented as a person that the User who made the query may know or as a
                “similar” person, some of Your profile information entered by you, excluding phone number, will be disclosed to such User.<em></em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Name Search</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Your name and telephone number and any other information You choose to submit on Your User Profile will be visible to the person You reach out to when
                requesting a contact via the Truecaller Name Search service. Your request will be forwarded to that person via an SMS and he or she may choose to share the
                phone number with You (of which You in such case will be informed of via a push notification), or not, at his or her own discretion, but may also block
                further request from You or to opt-out of the service altogether at any time. Nobody will under any circumstances receive more than three contact requests
                via the Truecaller Name Search service during any 24 hours and has anybody received nine request during the last 72 hours, that person will not receive
                additional requests for the next 72 hours. Excessive requests not delivered will be put on hold in chronological order, unless the recipient actively
                allows further requests to be forwarded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Via the Truecaller Name Search service You may be recommended, via a push notification, when there are new contacts that you may know and be interested in
                getting in touch with.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Opt-Out and Delist Numbers</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                If a User chooses to disable the Enhanced Search functionality, the Contact Information made available by that User is disabled and will thereafter not be
                accessible for queries. If any persons do not wish to have their names and phone numbers made available through the Enhanced Search or Name Search
            functionalities, they can exclude themselves from further queries by notifying Truecaller via its website at <a href="http://www.truecaller.com/">www.truecaller.com</a> or as set forth in the contact details below.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Miscellaneous</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the above Truecaller may disclose information related to the Users and Contact Information if we believe such action is necessary to:
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us;
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or
            </p>
            <p>
                (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users or members of the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to provide you with the Services you have requested, Truecaller may sometimes, if necessary, share Your above mentioned information and traffic
                data with trusted partner service providers and/or agents, i.e. banking organizations or other providers of payment and analytical services or SMS
                services. Truecaller will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and
                traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following is a description of how Truecaller may share information about you with trusted third party partners. Should Truecaller add additional
                partners, this description will be updated:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Truecaller uses a third party partner company in order to send You or a third party you wish to contact SMS when you use the Services. In order to send
                you the SMS, we send the third party company Your and the relevant third party’s phone numbers. This third party SMS partner is contractually obligated
                only to use these phone numbers for the transmission of requested SMS.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Truecaller may use Push Notification Services to notify you about up-dates and important information. In such cases, Your phone number may be part of
                the notification. This message is sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to Your device. You may, however, at any time-opt out or
                disable push notifications in the Truecaller App.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Truecaller may also send a queried telephone number to Twitter in order to verify it against the Twitter API or retrieve the holders’ Twitter ID or
                Twitter photo, if available. If the Twitter ID is available, Truecaller will display a Tweet and follow button in the Users’ Truecaller App, which the User
                may use to send an open tweet to, and start to follow, the holder of the number. The Truecaller App is not, however, designed to be a Twitter communication
                application and You will not be able to retrieve the replied or further tweets to the Truecaller App. When using the Twitter functionalities You are bound
            by the Twitter Terms of Service, located at <a href="http://twitter.com/tos">https://twitter.com/tos</a>, and the Twitter privacy policy, located at <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The submission of Contact Information by You and the processing thereof by Truecaller is constitutionally protected under the applicable law, see below.
                Truecaller may, however, disclose information contained in the Service and about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other
                issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary, always provided, of course, it is also lawful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Truecaller may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences from using the Truecaller Services, which will be used to measure and
                improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data. Any and all information which is voluntarily submitted in feedback
                forms or any surveys that You accept to take part in is used for the purposes of reviewing this feedback and improving the Truecaller software, products
                and websites.

                Truecaller servers may automatically collect data about Your Internet address when You use the Truecaller Services. This information, known as an Internet
                Protocol address, or “IP Address”, is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer or other device by Your Internet service provider whenever
                You are on the Internet. When You request pages from the Services, our servers may log Your IP Address and, if applicable, Your domain name. Your IP
                Address is used to help identify You and to gather demographic information about our Users as a whole. Truecaller’s servers may also record the referring
                page that linked you to Truecaller (e.g. another web site or a search engine); the pages You visit on the Services; the web site you visit after
                Truecaller’s web site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings
                you are using; any search terms You have entered on this web site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by Truecaller’s servers.
                Truecaller uses this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with servers, and to administer our Services. Such
                information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.
            </p>
            <p>
                Corresponding data may be collected and used for the same purposes when You enable and use the “search the web” functionality within the Truecaller App.
