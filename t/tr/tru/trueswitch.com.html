            <p>Esaya, Inc. ("Esaya") has created this privacy policy 
              ("Privacy Policy") in order to demonstrate our commitment 
              to customer privacy. Privacy on the World Wide Web site located 
              at <a href="http://www.trueswitch.com">http://www.trueswitch.com/ 
              </a>and other computer systems operated by Esaya (collectively, 
              the “Website”), is of great importance to us. Because 
              we gather important information from our users, we have established 
              this Privacy Policy as a means to communicate our information gathering 
              and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change this 
              Privacy Policy and will provide notification of the change at least 
              thirty (30) days prior to the change taking effect.</p>
            <p>
              Please be aware that the TrueSwitch Wizard, Website and Services 
              are not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If you 
              have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or 
              use the Website nor should you sign up for the Services offered 
              by Esaya.
            </p>
            <p>Any capitalized terms used and not defined in the Privacy Policy 
              are defined in the Terms of Service.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>1. COLLECTED INFORMATION</strong><br>
              We require users who sign-up to use the TrueSwitch Internet Service 
              Provider (“ISP”) switching services ("Services") 
              offered on our Website to provide their User ID and / or e-mail 
              address and passwords for their old and new Internet accounts. This 
              information is required to authenticate your access to each ISP 
              service and e-mail account as well as to provide the Services of 
              copying your personal data (including, stored e-mails, address books 
              and calendar / scheduling information), and forwarding e-mails from 
              your old e-mail account to your new e-mail account. We may need 
              to collect additional information if you wish to utilize the account 
              cancellation component of the Services. In such cases, we will only 
              collect the additional information required to initiate cancellation 
              of your old account.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              If payment is required for the Services, Esaya will request your 
              name, mailing address, phone number, credit card information and 
              other information to securely process the financial transaction. 
              This billing information is not used by Esaya for marketing or promotional 
              purposes. Esaya uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit 
              card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution 
              chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information 
              provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              Using the Services requires the Website to temporarily host data 
              and information ("Data") to copy your personal data and 
              forward e-mails from your old Internet account to your new Internet 
              account. Such Data may include forwarded e-mails, contents of your 
              address books, number and size of messages received, the domain 
              name and addresses of e-mail senders, and the number and size of 
              e-mail attachments. When messages or information is retrieved from 
              your old Internet account, it is stored in a queue for processing. 
              Once the messages or information is sent to your new Internet account, 
              the messages or information is deleted. Esaya does not scan the 
              messages or information for specific words or phrases and will not 
              read, share, distribute, print, reference or disclose to third parties 
              private e-mail communications or other messages or Data that are 
              transmitted using the Services excepting as required for the purpose 
              of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of 
              the Terms of Use, or as may be required by law.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              Esaya also collects information about your usage of various components 
              of the Services, including the number of e-mails, address book entries, 
              favorites and calendar entries copied to your new account, the number 
              of Change of Address Notification and Update Contact Information 
              Notification messages sent on your behalf and whether or not you 
              selected E-mail forwarding and help with account cancellation. You 
              can access this information via the My TrueSwitch section of the 
              Website at <a href="/mytrueswitch">https://www.trueswitch.com/mytrueswitch/login.jsp</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              We may also collect Website usage statistics such as Internet addresses, 
              browser types, domain names and page requests. This information 
              is logged to help diagnose technical problems, prepare for network 
              load demands, and to administer our Website in order to constantly 
              improve the quality of the Services.</p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>2. CORRECTING/UPDATING/DELETING INFORMATION.</strong><br>
              You have the right to access and correct, update, and/or delete 
              your Information at any time. You can do so via the My TrueSwitch 
              section of the Website accessible at <a href="/mytrueswitch">https://www.trueswitch.com/mytrueswitch/login.jsp</a>.<br>
              Your User ID to login to My TrueSwitch is your new e-mail address 
              and the password that you originally used for that account when 
              you used TrueSwitch. A request to revise or edit your personally 
              identifiable information may not be accommodated if it would result 
              in incorrect information. Requests for deletion of certain key information, 
              such as e-mail address, may require closing your TrueSwitch account.</p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>3. COOKIES</strong><br>
              When you interact with the Website we strive to make that experience 
              easy and meaningful. When you come to our Website, our server sends 
              a cookie to your computer. Cookies are small text files that Web 
              browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us 
              whether users and visitors have visited the Website previously.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely 
              recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself by 
              signing-up for the Services, you remain anonymous. Cookies come 
              in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist 
              only during an online session. They disappear from your computer 
              when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. 
              Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your 
              browser or turned off your computer. They include such information 
              as a unique identifier for your browser.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              Our Website uses session cookies containing encrypted or encoded 
              information including your username and session ID. This information 
              allows us to process your online transactions and requests. Session 
              cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've 
              logged in and are required in order to use the Services. Our Website 
              also uses persistent cookies, that only our Website can read and 
              use, to identify the fact that you are a TrueSwitch user or prior 
              Website visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful 
              about the security and confidentiality of the information stored 
              in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers 
              or passwords in persistent cookies.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology, invisible GIFs, 
              web bugs, or action tags, may be used to assist in delivering the 
              cookies on the Website. This technology tells us how many visitors 
              clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on a page. We 
              do not use this technology to access your personally identifiable 
              information; it is a tool we use to compile aggregated statistics 
              about Website usage. We may share aggregated Website statistics 
              with partner companies but do not allow other companies to place 
              clear gifs on the Website.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies 
              will be able to browse the Website but may not be able to successfully 
              use the Services.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>4. THIRD-PARTY SITES</strong><br>
              The Website contains links to other web sites. Should you click 
              on an advertisement in an e-mail message or on the Website, the 
              advertiser, or a company on its behalf, may collect information 
              or set and access cookies on your machine. Esaya is not responsible 
              for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. 
              Users and visitors will need to check the policy statement of these 
              others web sites to understand their policies. Users and visitors 
              who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information. 
              It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private 
              and confidential.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>5. ESAYA SENDS "CHANGE OF ADDRESS NOTICE" MESSAGES</strong><br>
              As part of the Services, a standard "Change of Address Notice" 
              containing your new e-mail address is e-mailed to the contacts listed 
              in your address book. Including your new e-mail address in the "Change 
              of Address Notice" message is intended to aid you in informing 
              your contacts of your new e-mail address.<br>&nbsp;<br>
              The "Change of Address Notice" feature is enabled by default 
              in the TrueSwitch Wizard, but can be disabled by selecting the “Custom 
              Switching” mode, then de-selecting the "Notify Contacts" 
              option. The "Change of Address Notice” message contents 
              can be customized by selecting the “Custom Switching” 
              mode, selecting the "Notify Contacts" option and then 
              editing the message text in the window.</p>
            <p><br>
              <strong>6. ESAYA SENDS "UPDATE CONTACT INFORMATION NOTIFICATION" 
              MESSAGES</strong><br>
              As part of the Services, an “Update Contact Information Notification” 
              is e-mailed to the contacts listed in your address book. Including 
              your contact information in the "Update Contact Information 
              Notification" message is intended to aid you in informing your 
              contacts of your new e-mail address and other personal contact information, 
              plus facilitate their providing you with their own updated contact 
              information.<br>&nbsp;<br>

              the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. 
              When the Website is accessed using Netscape Navigator, or Microsoft 
              Internet Explorer versions 4. 0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL)

              firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or 
              access from outside intruders. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized 
              access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of 
              Data.<br>
