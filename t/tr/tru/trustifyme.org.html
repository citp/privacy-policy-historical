<h1>Trustify-me Privacy Policy</h1>

  <li>When ordering we may       ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number,       credit card information or other information. You may, however, visit our       site anonymously. </li>

<li>Like  many websites, we use "cookies" to improve your experience and gather  information about visitors and visits to our websites. Please refer to the  "Do we use 'cookies'?" section below for information about cookies  and how we use them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information Use</h2>
<p>We may use the information we collect from you when you make a purchase , respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways: </p>


<ul type="disc">
  <li>To personalize your website       experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product       offerings in which you are most interested. </li>
  <li>To allow us to better       service you in responding to your customer service requests. </li>

<h2>Information Protection</h2>

<p>We apply a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is controlled behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via 128-Bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases using a random 16-digit encryption code, to be only accessed as stated above. For your convenience on future orders, and to automate the monthly and/or annual recurring transaction process, you can store your credit card information longer than 60 days if you select the "Keep my payment method on file for easy checkout on future orders" box during checkout. </p>

<h2>Do we use "cookies"?</h2>
<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider stores on your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For example, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about website traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
<p>We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>

<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the telephone by contacting customer service.</p>

<p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
