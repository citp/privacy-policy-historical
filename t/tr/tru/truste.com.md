POLICY HIGHLIGHTS**

TRUSTe's mission is to build trust online among businesses and consumers. For businesses, we believe this begins with privacy accountability and transparent privacy practices.

**For Consumers:  
**

_Watchdog Complaints  
_

We encourage you to use [TRUSTe’s Watchdog Dispute Resolution process](http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint) to report and resolve privacy complaints you may have concerning TRUSTe Sealholders or to report misuse of TRUSTe trademarks. If you choose to file a Watchdog complaint about a TRUSTe Sealholder, we require that you provide your name, email address, city, state, country, postal code, name of the Web site, URL, and a description of the privacy issue you are reporting. Any additional personal information you provide on the Watchdog Complaint Form is optional; we will use the information you provide to investigate your complaint and to send you a Watchdog Customer Satisfaction Survey once your complaint is resolved. We encourage you to complete the survey; whether you do so or not is entirely up to you. 

We will not share your name or email address with the TRUSTe Sealholder that is the subject of your privacy complaint, or anyone else outside TRUSTe, unless you give us explicit permission to do so. Please be aware, however, that if you do not permit us to share your name and email address, our ability to successfully resolve your complaint may be limited. 

If you are a resident of a European Union Member State, and your Watchdog complaint concerns the offline information practices of a TRUSTe EU Safe Harbor Program Sealholder, you have two other options for filing your complaint: you may fax your complaint to us at (415) 520-3420, or mail it to TRUSTe Watchdog Program, 55 2nd Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105. We will use the personal information you provide in the manner described above for all Watchdog Complaints.

We post information about Watchdog Complaints on our “For Consumers” page on a monthly basis, but only in aggregated form (i.e., without identifying individual complainants). 

_Consumer Opinion Surveys_

We occasionally conduct online consumer surveys to learn about your views on important privacy issues. We do not collect personally identifying information in these surveys. We use the survey data to improve our programs and services, and may publicize the results as a public service. 

Learn more about our Web site information practices in the “For all Visitors” section of this Privacy Statement.

_Sign-Up for TRUSTe Programs and Services  
_

If you apply to become a TRUSTe Web Seal Program Sealholder through our Web site, we will use the personally identifying information you provide there (e.g., your name, address, email address and company information) to follow up with you about your application and to assist you in the certification process. If you provide us the personal information of others (including but not limited to, name and email address of a colleague who will assist you in completing your application), we will use that information only for the purpose of sending your colleague a user name and password to access your application. 

If your company is a TRUSTe Web Seal Program Sealholder, we will use the information in your application to both provide you with ongoing TRUSTe support and communicate regularly with you. From time to time we will also offer you the opportunity to receive information about privacy-related products or services offered by our third-party partners. We will not share your personally identifying information with these third parties, other than service providers, unless we have your explicit permission to do so. 

We will use information submitted through our Web site to analyze the characteristics of our Sealholders in order to improve our services to them. We will occasionally provide aggregated statistics about our Sealholders in reports made available to them, to third parties, or to the general public. These reports will not identify individual TRUSTe Sealholders. 

If you wish to sign up for TRUSTe programs other than the Web Seal Program, or to simply obtain information about TRUSTe programs and services, visit our [“Certification Center”](https://getcertified.truste.org/ecommerce/) page or [“Contact Us”](http://forms.truste.com/go/truste/learnmore) form. On those pages you’ll be asked to enter your name, email address, phone number, and additional company information. We’ll use this information to contact you about your request, to assist you in the application process or to follow up with you about the programs and services in which you have expressed an interest. We will not share the information you provide with third parties, other than service providers, without your explicit permission. 

You can ask us to delete the information you provided on our “Contact Us” page by contacting us as [privacyquestions@truste.com](mailto:privacyquestions@truste.com). You may unsubscribe from any of our e-mail communications with you by following the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our email communications or by visiting <http://forms.truste.com/go/truste/unsubscribe>.

_Customer Service Inquiries - LivePerson

 _TRUSTe Sealholders  
_

If you are currently a member of a TRUSTe program, you can begin the process of renewing your TRUSTe seal by clicking on our How to Renew page. If you provide information on our Contact Us form, because you are requesting information about additional TRUSTe programs, we will use the contact information you provide there to respond to your request. We will not share this information with third parties, other than service providers, without your explicit permission unless otherwise provided in this Privacy Statement.

Occasionally we conduct customer satisfaction surveys so that our Sealholders can provide feedback on their experience in the TRUSTe certification process and their participation in our programs. Contact information requested in these surveys is optional. We use the survey responses to improve our programs and services to Sealholders. We also occasionally share this survey data with third parties, but only in aggregate form, i.e., without disclosing personal information or identifying individual Sealholders.
