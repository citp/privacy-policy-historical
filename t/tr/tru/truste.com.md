We use email links located on the "contact us" page and other areas of the site to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have.

We may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard the information. Your personal information is only shared with third parties with your explicit permission.

·         Submitting a Watchdog Report

TRUSTe created the Watchdog Dispute Resolution Mechanism to provide you with a mechanism for reporting and resolving privacy violations, misuse of the trustmark, or specific privacy concerns pertaining to a member Web site. We request your name, email address, name of the Web site, URL, and description of the privacy violation. This information is used to look into the alleged violation and bring it to a satisfactory resolution. Certain personally identifiable information like your name and email address may be shared with the member site, but only if you indicate that we have your explicit permission to do this by marking the appropriate boxes. If you do not give us your permission to share your personally identifiable information, then we will not share it with anyone outside of TRUSTe. However, in some cases, this may limit our ability to successfully resolve your complaint. Any contact information a user provides on the Watchdog page is optional and will not be used for any other purpose than to investigate and respond to your report. Aggregate information about Watchdogs is posted on TRUSTe’s Web site on a monthly basis.
