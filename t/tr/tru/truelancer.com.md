It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information. **Note that we combine the information we collect from you from the Site, through the Service generally, or offline.**

By accessing or using the Service, you consent to the information collection, disclosure and use practices described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that certain features or services referenced in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on the Service at all times. Please also review our Terms of Service, which governs your use of the Service, and which is accessible at <https://www.truelancer.com/terms-service>. 

By visiting [www.truelancer.com](https://www.truelancer.com/) you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Policy.

  * Truelancer does not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to third parties. 
  * Truelancer does not share your contact information with other users or third parties without your consent. 
  * Any personally identifiable information that you provide to Truelancer will be secured with industry standard protocols and technology.



### 1\. INFORMATION COLLECTION

Truelancer is an online marketplace that connects clients & freelancers. Users of the Service may be **Clients** (anyone utilizing the Truelancer platform to request services to be performed by a Freelancer) or **Freelancers** (any company, individual user, or groups of associated individual users or companies utilizing the Truelancer platform to offer services to Clients). Freelancers may also use the platform as clients to work with other Freelancers. 

**Information You Provide to Us**

  * **Personal Information:** In the course of using the Service (whether as a Client or Freelancer), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific individual and can be used to contact or identify you ( **“Personal Information”** ). Examples of Personal Information include your name, email address, company address, billing address, and phone number. 
  * **Payment Information:** If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect certain payment information, such as credit card, PayPal, Payoneer or other bank account information, and billing address. 
  * **Identity Verification:** We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth or taxpayer identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete tax filings. We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your government-issued identification or photo or a billing statement. 
  * **General Audience Service:** The Service is general audience and intended for users 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone younger than age 18. If we become aware that a child younger than 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child younger than age 18 and believe that Truelancer has collected Personal Information from your child, please contact us at: legal@truelancer.com. 
  * **Non-Identifying Information:** We also may collect other information, such as zip codes, demographic data, information regarding your use of the Service, and general project-related data (“Non-Identifying Information”). We may aggregate information collected from Truelancer registered and non-registered users ( **"Truelancer Users”** ). We consider usernames to be Non-Identifying Information. Usernames are made public through the Service and are viewable by other Truelancer Users. 



**Information Received from Third Parties**

We also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records or third parties may provide information in connection with a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a third-party service). If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as described in this Privacy Policy. 

**Information Collected from Users Automatically**

We and our third party service providers, including analytics and third party content providers, may automatically collect certain information from you whenever you access or interact with the Service. This information may include, among other information, the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to the Service, areas within the Service that you visited, and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate with websites. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality. 

The information we collect also includes the Internet Protocol ( **“IP”** ) address, your location (If you allow) or other unique device identifier ( **“Device Identifier”** ) for any device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) used to access the Service. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access the Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Service. 

**The technology used to collect information automatically from Truelancer Users may include the following:**

  * **Cookies:** Like many websites, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that remain on your computer or similar device (such as to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service and to track your compliance with the Truelancer Terms of Service) and session ID cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session (for example, to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how Truelancer Users interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage by Truelancer Users and web traffic routing on the Service). You may be able to instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Service. 
  * **Web Beacons:** We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” and/or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of what content on our Service is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Service, to monitor how Truelancer Users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. 
  * **Embedded Scripts:** We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also employ software technology known as an Embedded Script. An Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service. 



In addition, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may use a variety of other technologies (such as tags) that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes and we may use third parties to perform these services on our behalf. 

**User Profiles** You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, and may include Personal Information, photographs, examples of your work, information on work previously performed via the Service and outside the Service, skills, hourly pay rates, income from Truelancer, feedback/rating information and other information, including your username (“Profile”). The information in your Profile may be visible to all Truelancer Users and the general public subject to the privacy choices you make within your Truelancer Profile. You may edit certain information in your Profile via your account and may choose to limit who is able to view certain content you post to your Profile. If, in any case, you believe that an unauthorized profile has been created about you, you can request for it to be removed by contacting us at **support@truelancer.com**. 

To request removal of your personal information from our website, contact us at **support@truelancer.com**. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. 

### 2\. INFORMATION USE

WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT:   


  * To provide and improve the Service, complete your transactions, and address your inquiries, process your registration, verify the information you provide is valid and for compliance and internal business purposes; 
  * To contact you with administrative communications and Truelancer newsletters, marketing or promotional materials (on behalf of Truelancer or third parties) and other information that may be of interest to you.

If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly. You also may request, sometimes through your use of an SNS or similar interactive feature or third party application, that we share information about you with a third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances. 
  * **Internal and Business Transfers:** Truelancer may share information, including Personal Information, with its company MyRemoteTeam Inc., subsidiaries, and affiliates, primarily for business and operational purposes.
