When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, in the limited circumstances where this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 

Data relating to bank cards and other payment methods are stored by our secured payment service provider 2Checkout for as long as reasonably required for business purposes or as reasonably required to comply with their legal obligations. By subscribing to the services offered on the Website, you expressly agree to this storage. 

#### 6\. Information Safety

We take reasonable technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 

This measures include but are not limited to: 

  * SSL [certificates](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.truesocialmetrics.com&latest)
  * PCI / DSS [verification](https://sealserver.trustwave.com/cert.php?customerId=39b353b4d37e4114b8aa8f1fad618132&size=105x54&style=) / (that includes policies of password encryptions, data encryptions, payment information storing, access limitation etc.)

  * Our data processing and storage happens in monitored data centers managed by Amazon. 
  * For logging into most of the data sources, our tools use OAuth. This is a secure authentication method, which means that you never have to type your password into our tools, as the authentication happens on a webpage hosted by the data source (eg. Google, Facebook etc.).

  * Session cookie used by the application to store state between page views (such as your current logged in information)

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, excessive or manifestly unfounded.
