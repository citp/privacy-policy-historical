Depending on the action, we may collect your name, email address, email format preference (HTML vs. Text), address, interests, and similar information. For financial transactions such as donations or store purchases, we will need to collect your credit card number. We use customer information collected to send the requested information, complete the requested transaction, and present the most relevant information to our listeners based on their interests. We never sell, share or trade any of our customer information with other companies.

Any transaction that can be completed online may also be completed via phone or mail, should you have concerns about security. Please see our contact page for information on reaching our customer service team.
