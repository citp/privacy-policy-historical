            <h2><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h2>
<p>(October 2019)</p>
<p>By creating a profile on or using any of the Trustpilot websites including, but not limited to www.trustpilot.com, (the ”Website”) you accept the terms contained in this Privacy Policy, which govern the processing of your personal data on the Website.</p>
<p>We, Trustpilot, Inc., 245 5th Avenue, 4th floor, New York, NY 10016, USA (“Trustpilot”) recommend that you print and keep a copy of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>1.&nbsp; Collecting information on the Website</h3>
<p>1.1&nbsp; Master data</p>
<p>When you create a profile on the Website, we collect the following master data: Your username, your password and your email address. The purpose of the collection of this information is to identify you as user when you log on to the Website. Furthermore, you can choose to add more information to your profile, such as your photo and demographic information.</p>
<p>1.2&nbsp; Reviews</p>
<p>When you make a review of a company, we collect the information you state in the review, including which company you review, which purchase(s) the review concerns, and how you evaluate the company.</p>
<p>1.3&nbsp; Cookies</p>
<p>The Website uses cookies. Cookies are digital information which is stored on your computer. The cookie does not identify the individual user but the user’s computer, and it is used for different purposes. You can read more about what cookies the Website uses and for what purposes below.</p>
<p>1.4&nbsp; IP adresses and browser settings</p>
<p>When visiting the Website, the IP address and the browser settings of your computer are registered. The IP address is the numerical address of the computer used when visiting the Website. Browser settings are e.g. the type of browser you use, browser language, timezone etc. The IP address and browser settings are registered to enable Trustpilot to trace the used computer in case of misuse or unlawful actions in connection with the visit on or use of the Website. Further, the IP address is used to derive your approximate location (city level).</p>
<p>1.5&nbsp; Newsletter</p>
<p>If you sign up for Trustpilot’s newsletters, Trustpilot register the information supplied by you (e.g. your name, email address etc.). If you no longer wish to receive newsletters from Trustpilot, you can unsubscribe by logging on to your profile and edit your information.</p>
<p>1.6&nbsp; Information from other services, including Social Network(s)</p>
<p>As part of our services, we provide you with the possibility of connecting your profile on the Website with your profile on social networks such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter (“Social Network(s)”). Some information about you will automatically be collected from Social Networks when connecting your Trustpilot profile with your profile on Social Networks.</p>
<p>The information collected from Social Networks depends on what information you have made available on the network and your privacy settings for sharing such information on the network. Depending on the settings, we may e.g. collect the following information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and/or username</li>
<li>E-mail address</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Profile photo</li>
<li>Location</li>
</ul>
<p>When you request to have your Trustpilot profile connected to a profile on a Social Network, you will be informed on which information we will collect from the network in question before your request is executed.</p>
<p>The purpose of collecting information from Social Networks is to connect members of your network, which are both users of Trustpilot and of one or more of the Social Networks, and thereby both increase the confidence in the reviews made by the members of the network as well as create a better user experience on the Website.</p>
<p>Trustpilot does not collect other personal identifiable information from visitors of the Website, unless the visitor provides the information to us.</p>
<h3>2.&nbsp; Disclosure of personal data</h3>
<p>2.1&nbsp; Disclosure of data on the Website</p>
<p>Please note that your consent to these guidelines implies that your profile on the Website may <strong>not be anonymous</strong>.</p>

<p>Other information provided by you on the Website, including photos and reviews, are automatically made available for other users of the Website. In some instances, the companies you review will also receive information about your review.</p>

<p>When you make a contribution to the Website your approximate city location (based on your computer’s IP address, see section 1.4, or based on location data provided by your mobile phone or other device) is made available to other users of the Website.</p>
<p>Social Networks</p>
<p>If you connect to a Social Network, information such as your profile photo, your name, year of birth and approximate location will be collected from your profile on the Social Network and used to identify you on the Website. <strong>Consequently, all users of the Website will, subject to information available from the Social Network, be able to identify the reviews created by you</strong>.</p>
<p>If your contacts or your contact’s contacts (jointly referred to as “Connections”) on the Social Network also have connected with Trustpilot, we may display on the Website how you are connected to these Connections through the Social Network.</p>

<p>2.3&nbsp; Disclosure to other services</p>
<p>A main purpose of Trustpilot is to increase the exposure and the availability of the reviews made on the Website. Hence, we permit other services to show the reviews created on the Website thus increasing other consumers’ knowledge of your reviews.</p>
<p>The categories of third parties to which the information is disclosed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search engines, including e.g. Google and Bing,</li>
<li>Operators of consumer portals and business portals, including price comparison websites, shopping guides etc.</li>
<li>Companies or services that have been reviewed on the Website or which have a relationship with Trustpilot</li>

<h3>3.&nbsp; Data controller</h3>
<p>3.1&nbsp; The information for which Trustpilot is the data controller</p>
<p>Trustpilot shall be data controller of the master data you enter in connection with your creation of a profile or registration for newsletters, i.e. your name, your password and your email address, as well as registration of your IP address.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Trustpilot shall be the data controller of the information which is disclosed to other services, cf. section 2.3. Danish data protection laws govern collection of data by Trustpilot in the EU.</p>
<p>3.2&nbsp; The information for which you are the data controller</p>
<p>You shall be data controller of the content you choose to disclose on the Website and for the data disclosed on your profile on Social Networks, which is the consequence of the connection of your profile on the Website with your profile on the Social Network.</p>
<p>3.3&nbsp; Links to websites</p>
<p>The Website contains links to other websites. Note that by clicking such links you will be transferred to other websites for which Trustpilot is not the data controller. We thus recommend that you always read the personal data policy of these websites, as their procedure for collecting and processing personal data may be different from ours.</p>
<h3>4.&nbsp; Data processor</h3>
<p>Trustpilot uses an external company for maintaining the technical operation of the Website. This company is the data processor with regards to the personal data for which Trustpilot is the data controller.</p>
<p>By accepting this personal data policy, you accept that Trustpilot also allows the data for which you are the data controller be processed by the same data processor.</p>
<p>The data processor shall solely act according to instructions from Trustpilot. By accepting these terms and conditions, you authorize Trustpilot to give such instructions to the data processor which are necessary for the processing of data in accordance with this personal data policy and for the purpose of use of the Website.</p>
<p>The data processor has made necessary technical and organizational safety measures against the information being accidentally or illegally destroyed, lost or deteriorated, and against the information coming to the knowledge of unauthorized persons, is misused or in other ways is processed in violation with the act on processing of personal data. On your request – and against remuneration of the data processor’s current hourly rates at any time for such work – the data processor shall supply you with sufficient information to demonstrate that the above-mentioned technical and organizational safety measures have been made.</p>
<p>Trustpilot may now or in the future process and/or store personal data in the U.S. If you access or use the Website from a location outside of the U.S., you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal data in the U.S.</p>
<h3>5.&nbsp; Security measures</h3>
<p>Trustpilot will use commercially reasonable efforts to see that the recorded data, including the personal information, under its control is handled using appropriate security measures. Trustpilot regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, Trustpilot cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to Trustpilot. Emails sent via the Website are not encrypted, and Trustpilot therefore advises you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.</p>
