# Privacy policy | Truecaller

In Truecaller´s mission to build the most accurate and complete phone community accessible to anyone, anywhere across the globe, Truecaller is depending on the Users sharing certain information. Being a collaborative community the top-priority of Truecaller will always be the relationship with its community. Truecaller is therefore firmly committed to the security and protection of the personal integrity of the Users of the Services (as defined in the [_Terms of Service_](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service)) and their contacts. 

This Privacy Policy describes what personal information You may share with Truecaller, as data controller, and other Users when activating and using the Truecaller Services, how Truecaller receives, collects and uses this data and how You may opt-out at any time, altogether preventing use of the data shared via the Services. 

**Information Collected and Received**

_Installation_

When you install the Truecaller App, Truecaller will collect some technical information from Your device in order to be able to provide You with the Services, namely Your IP address, the unique device ID number and what operating system, operator, screen resolution and version of the Truecaller App You use. This information is used to verify that the User device is properly registered and will not be used to identify You personally or be transferred to third parties. We will, however, use this data for statistics and user support as long as You use the Services. 

For details regarding permission usage in connection with installation on the Android platform, please see the Truecaller FAQ at [www.truecaller.com/support](http://www.truecaller.com/support) . 

_User Profile_

Where the User registers a user profile in the Truecaller App and via an sms or inbound call verification confirms being the holder of a certain number, the information up-loaded to the profile section of the Truecaller App will be received and stored by Truecaller until the User changes or deletes such data or terminates the Services. Compulsory information when creating a profile page is the User’s first name, last name and phone number and additional information that may be provided at the User’s option include, but is not limited to, photo, gender, street address and zip code, county of residence, email address, professional website, Facebook page, Twitter address and a short status message. 

Please note that the User personally is responsible for any Content up-loaded to and displayed in the user profile. 

_Identifiers_

In addition, You may provide us with Your user identifier information regarding certain third party services, i.e. Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter, necessary for the application to interoperate with such third party services. In that case Truecaller will store and process also that information (and also a mapped photo where applicable), for as long as You use the Services and will not use this information for any other purpose than required in order to obtain interoperability and functionality in relation to such third party services. Please note that we never store any passwords to the mentioned third party services. 

_Contact Information_

Where the Truecaller App is obtained from other sources than Apple App Store or Google Play, You may share the names and numbers contained in Your device’s address book (“Contact Information”) with Truecaller for the purpose described below under _Enhanced Search_. 

Where the Truecaller App is obtained from Apple App Store or Google Play, we will only use Contact Information for the sole purpose of recognizing and recommending You to people You may know within the Truecaller community. 

In addition to Contact Information, if You choose to activate use of a third party Social Network Service, such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIN or Twitter, within the Truecaller App, Truecaller may up-load, store and use the list of identifiers associated with said services linked to the Contact Information in order to enhance the results shared with other Users. 

_Please note that no other Contact Information than the phone numbers and thereto attached names will be received, stored and used from the User’s address book. Other numbers or information that may be contained in your device’s phone book will be filtered away and will therefore _not_ be stored or used by Truecaller. Addresses, passwords and credit card numbers and any other similar information will automatically be prevented from being entered into the Truecaller database by our safety algorithms, that filters any numbers and other information stored in the phone book in a number sequence not compatible with that used for telephone numbers. Please also note that You can always _choose_ not to share Contact Information with Truecaller and if You have shared information and changed Your mind, You can easily delist Your number or opt-out to render your entire Contact Information unavailable for search in the database for Enhanced Search. _

_Call Block_

Where a User within the Services reports a phone number as spam, Truecaller stores that phone number in combination with the User’s RegisterID in order to maintain the User’s spam list online but also for the purpose of building a community based spam blocking directory. On the Android platform, the User can also add a name to the phone number in question that will only be visible to that User. __

**Use, Sharing and Disclosure of User and Contact Information**

Information related to the User or Contact Information will only be used to 

(a) display the name associated with a certain number at a manual number search against the Truecaller database, 

(b) automatically display the caller’s name when a call is received, as enabled by the Enhanced Search functionality, as described below, to Users who have activated that functionality, and indicate possible mutual contact points with the caller or when an incoming call may be spam, 

(c) “update phonebook” and display the “who viewed my profile” functionalities of the Services, 

(d) provide limited API for queries against the Truecaller database for a selected number of Truecaller partners, 

(e) enable the Truecaller Name Search, as described below, to Users who have activated that functionality, and 

(f) contact You from Truecaller for verification purposes or with information pertaining to the Services, e g newsletter e-mails and similar notifications. 

_Enhanced Search functionality and database_   
To improve the Services, Truecaller has created a searchable database where the Users generate the content and via the Enhanced Search functionality are offered access to this database, containing Contact Information from those Users who permit such aggregation. In return these Users are allowed to access to the database by querying it. Queries against the database are only allowed through the Truecaller Services by Users who have explicitly approved of the Service's functionality and integrity restrictions as contained in the [_Truecaller Terms of Service_](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service), the [_API License Addendum_](https://web.archive.org/api-license-addendum) and this Privacy Policy. __

The queries against the Truecaller Enhanced Search database are processed only if a numeric phone number is attributed to the query and only if no results are published by an associated or partnering database of Truecaller. The response given to the queried number will be the associated name to that number, if any name is available. 

_It is important to notice the following distinctions. As an integrity and security measure, only numeric queries are allowed against the Truecaller database for Enhanced Search, i e there will be no result to a name query. Name searches may, however, give result via the Services if a partnering or associated database to Truecaller has numbers available to the name queries. The Users contributing to Enhanced Search can therefore rely on that the Contact Information provided, as a personal integrity precaution, will not enable anyone searching for the number to a certain person direct access to that number. In some cases, Users may, however, use the Services to forward a request to a named person in order to get in touch, please see below about the Truecaller Name Search service._

The database may also – via a “social graph” algorithm - be used to show the User how many other Users that he or she has in common with another User and to suggest other contacts they may have in common. Please note that, if You are presented as a person that the User who made the query may know or as a “similar” person, some of Your profile information entered by you, excluding phone number, will be disclosed to such User. __

_Name Search_

Your name and telephone number and any other information You choose to submit on Your User Profile will be visible to the person You reach out to when requesting a contact via the Truecaller Name Search service. Your request will be forwarded to that person via an SMS and he or she may choose to share the phone number with You (of which You in such case will be informed of via a push notification), or not, at his or her own discretion, but may also block further request from You or to opt-out of the service altogether at any time. Nobody will under any circumstances receive more than three contact requests via the Truecaller Name Search service during any 24 hours and has anybody received nine request during the last 72 hours, that person will not receive additional requests for the next 72 hours. Excessive requests not delivered will be put on hold in chronological order, unless the recipient actively allows further requests to be forwarded. 

Via the Truecaller Name Search service You may be recommended, via a push notification, when there are new contacts that you may know and be interested in getting in touch with. 

_Opt-Out and Delist Numbers_

If a User chooses to disable the Enhanced Search functionality, the Contact Information made available by that User is disabled and will thereafter not be accessible for queries. If any persons do not wish to have their names and phone numbers made available through the Enhanced Search or Name Search functionalities, they can exclude themselves from further queries by notifying Truecaller via its website at [www.truecaller.com](http://www.truecaller.com/) or as set forth in the contact details below. 

_Miscellaneous_

In addition to the above Truecaller may disclose information related to the Users and Contact Information if we believe such action is necessary to: 

(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us; 

(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or 

(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users or members of the public. 

In order to provide you with the Services you have requested, Truecaller may sometimes, if necessary, share Your above mentioned information and traffic data with trusted partner service providers and/or agents, i.e. banking organizations or other providers of payment and analytical services or SMS services. Truecaller will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. 

The following is a description of how Truecaller may share information about you with trusted third party partners. Should Truecaller add additional partners, this description will be updated: 

1\. Truecaller uses a third party partner company in order to send You or a third party you wish to contact SMS when you use the Services. In order to send you the SMS, we send the third party company Your and the relevant third party’s phone numbers. This third party SMS partner is contractually obligated only to use these phone numbers for the transmission of requested SMS. 

2\. Truecaller may use Push Notification Services to notify you about up-dates and important information. In such cases, Your phone number may be part of the notification. This message is sent to the push notification service provider, for delivery to Your device. You may, however, at any time-opt out or disable push notifications in the Truecaller App. 

3\. Truecaller may also send a queried telephone number to Twitter in order to verify it against the Twitter API or retrieve the holders’ Twitter ID or Twitter photo, if available. If the Twitter ID is available, Truecaller will display a Tweet and follow button in the Users’ Truecaller App, which the User may use to send an open tweet to, and start to follow, the holder of the number. The Truecaller App is not, however, designed to be a Twitter communication application and You will not be able to retrieve the replied or further tweets to the Truecaller App. When using the Twitter functionalities You are bound by the Twitter Terms of Service, located at [https://twitter.com/tos](http://twitter.com/tos), and the Twitter privacy policy, located at <https://twitter.com/privacy>.

Truecaller may, however, disclose information contained in the Service and about you if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance that disclosure of information is necessary, always provided, of course, it is also lawful. 

Truecaller may from time to time ask you to provide information on your experiences from using the Truecaller Services, which will be used to measure and improve quality. You are at no time under any obligation to provide any of such data.
