## Our Pledge to You, Our Customer

TrueShip respects your privacy. We do not sell, rent, loan or transfer any personal information regarding our customers to any unrelated third parties. Any information you give us is held with the utmost care and security and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. 

Information collected on our web site is collected and used by TrueShip, LLC. and its affiliates. TrueShip will not collect any personal or business information except when specifically and knowingly provided. Examples of personally identifiable information include full name, address, email address and phone number. 

## Use of Information

Information collected by TrueShip is used internally by authorized TrueShip personnel for two main purposes. First, we collect information to figure out how to improve our site by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular. Second, we collect information to process and fulfill your product orders. If we want to collect information for other purposes, we will inform you when we collect the information. 

On occasion, TrueShip may also share non-personal, summary information regarding our customers with unrelated third parties (for example, we publicly disclose the aggregate number of registered users of our software). However, TrueShip does not share any personal information about any particular customer with unrelated third parties.
