HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION  
The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us and we take reasonable precautions to protect it.  Information that is collected that is deemed to be confidential will be collected using secure socket layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts data sent from your browser to our servers.  This data is then also encrypted in our databases, and only accessible by authorized staff within our organization.  Additionally, most Internet browsers also offer their own security features that enable end users to control how their transmissions are protected.  Please remember, however, that any personally identifiable information you send to us via the Internet is subject to the risk of unlawful interception by third parties, and that no method of safeguarding information is 100% secure.  Further, please note that, in our discretion, aggregated information that contains no personally identifiable information may not be treated as private or confidential.

CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13  
The Services are not intended for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of majority in your place of residence, you may use the Services only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian.  If we learn that we have received any information directly from a child under the age of 13 without first receiving his or her parent’s or legal guardian’s verified consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) to inform the child that he or she cannot use the Services and subsequently we will delete that information.  If you believe we might have any personally identifiable information from or about a child under the age of 13, please email us at support@truckstop.com.

Our Privacy Policy may change at any time.  If there is a significant change in the information we collect or our other privacy practices, we will provide you notice through the Services or by another means.  Your continued access and use of the Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check our Privacy Policy periodically for updates.  Your access and use of the Services following the posting of any revised Privacy Policy will be deemed acceptance of the revised policy.
