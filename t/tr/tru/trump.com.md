* **What Are Cookies?**

A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of your Device when you visit a website. Some cookies are functional and enable additional functionality when a user accesses the website (e.g. allows users to save user preferences or language suggestions). Other cookies are non-functional and allow the website and third parties to tailor messages and advertising relevant to a user’s interests. When we refer to cookies, this includes other similar technologies such as flash cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or bugs (including transparent or clear gifs). We use cookies to keep track of how you use our Sites and Services so we may provide a personalized service.

* **What Types of Cookies Do We Use?**.

We do not place cookies until you elect to continue using our Site after our cookie banner displays.

Our cookie management tool uses Cookiepedia to, with no input from us, automatically categorize cookies that we deploy on our Sites. We use the following types of cookies:

  * _Strictly Necessary Cookies:_ These cookies are necessary for the Sites to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Site(s) may not work if you choose to do so.
  * _Performance Cookies:_ These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of our Sites. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Sites. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited our Site(s).
  * _Functional Cookies:_ These cookies allow the provision of enhanced functionality and personalization, such as videos and live chats. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these functionalities may not function properly.
  * _Targeting Cookies:_ These cookies are set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant ads on other sites. They work by uniquely identifying your browser and Device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will not experience our targeted advertising across different websites.
