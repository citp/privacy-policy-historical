				<span> <h3>TrueIdentity from TransUnion Interactive is firmly committed to respecting the consumer's right to privacy and has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment.</h3>
<h3>Last updated September 20, 2016.</h3>
<h3>The Information We Collect from You</h3>
<p>TransUnion Interactive allows you to access your credit report and related information conveniently and affordably through our Web site. We collect your personal information only if you decide to purchase or enroll in one of our products or services, participate in our affiliate program, subscribe to our emails or newsletter, participate in one of our contests or surveys or transact other business with us. In order to process your transactions and provide you with quality customer service, we need your full name and current and/or billing address, your email address (so we can contact you), phone number and, if you purchase one of our products or services, a valid credit card number, your Social Security number and certain other personal information, such as your date of birth, address information, employment information, and certain credit card and loan account information. We use such personal information to authenticate the credit card number and to confirm that the person requesting your credit report really is you and not an impostor or other person improperly seeking to access your information.  If you are a consumer enrolled in our free product, we will also use your personal information in order to send you the targeted offers that are part of the free product.</p>
<h3>What Security Measures We Take</h3>
<p>TransUnion Interactive takes precautions to secure your personal information. If and when we ask you to provide your personal information, we will do so through a Web page that uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. This protocol provides security for your information by encrypting it as it travels from your computer to our computer. For security purposes we then move all of the personal information that we collect or obtain about you, including your credit report, to an environment on our proprietary network that has controls in place to limit access to and secure the data maintained therein. For more information about our security practices, please review our Security Policy at <a href="https://membership.trueidentity.com/tucm/support.page">https://membership.trueidentity.com/tucm/support.page</a>?</p>
<h3>How We Use and Share Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>If you indicate to us that you are interested in receiving information regarding other products and services including targeted offers, your name and e-mail address may be shared with a third party in order to present these offers to you. Personal information that is shared with these entities will be monitored in accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. If you prefer not to receive such information, you may indicate your preference by marking the appropriate box when you register, place an order or update your account information, and TransUnion Interactive will not send you any promotional materials.</p>
<h3>Emails</h3>
<p>As a service to you, we will email you a receipt of your purchase. Some of our membership products, such as TrueIdentity, may also include alert emails or other informational emails that are sent on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. These emails are part of the membership benefits and cannot be disabled for persons who are members of these products.</p>
<h3>Ordering</h3>
<p>When you order a credit report or other product or service, TransUnion Interactive must share some of your personal information with third parties in order to process your transaction. For example, TransUnion Interactive must share your name, address and social security number with one or more of the major credit reporting agencies in order to obtain your requested credit report, and must share your name, address and credit card account number with our credit card processing partner in order to process your payment. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
<h3>Third Parties</h3>
<p>If you indicated to us when you registered, placed an order or updated your account that you were interested in receiving information about products and services provided by TransUnion Interactive and its marketing partners, or if you opted for the free membership option, your name and email address may be shared with a third party in order to present these offers to you. These entities are only allowed to use shared information for the intended purpose only and will be monitored in accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. In the event you indicate that you want to receive offers from TransUnion Interactive and its marketing partners, your information may be used to serve relevant ads to you when you visit the site and to send you targeted offers. <strong>For the avoidance of doubt, you understand that in order to receive the free membership, you must agree to receive targeted offers.</strong></p>
<p>TransUnion Interactive also may disclose your personal information to third parties in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with, or be responsive to, legal process served on us (such as a subpoena), or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of TransUnion Interactive, our users or others. In addition, we may disclose your personal information to consultants, agents and advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is within the scope of their professional duties to TransUnion Interactive and with the understanding that such professionals will abide by our security and confidentiality policies.</p>
<p>In the event that you unsubscribe from email communications, we may share your email address with our compliance agents or approved marketing partners to prevent you from receiving additional offers.</p>

<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site or on other sites which we use for advertising. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness; and they are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous.
