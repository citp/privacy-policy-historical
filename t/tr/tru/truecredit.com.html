<p class="subTitle">TransUnion Interactive is firmly committed to respecting the consumer's right to privacy
                                        and has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our commitment.</p>
<p class="subTitle">Last updated August 17, 2010.</p>


   <p><strong>The Information We Collect from You</strong><br>
      TransUnion Interactive allows you to access your credit report and related information conveniently and affordably through our Web site. We collect your personal information only if you decide to purchase one of our products or services, participate in our affiliate program, subscribe to our emails or newsletter, participate in one of our contests or surveys or transact other business with us. In order to process your transactions and provide you with quality customer service, we need your full name and current and/or billing address, your email address (so we can contact you) and, if you purchase one of our products or services, a valid credit card number, your Social Security number and certain other personal information, such as your date of birth, address information, employment information, and certain credit card and loan account information. We use such personal information to authenticate the credit card number and to confirm that the person requesting your credit report really is you and not an impostor or other person improperly seeking to access your information.
   </p>
   <p>
      <strong>What Security Measures We Take </strong><br>
      TransUnion Interactive takes precautions to secure your personal information. If and when we ask you to provide your personal information, we will do so through a Web page that uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. This protocol provides security for your information by encrypting it as it travels from your computer to our computer. For security purposes we then move all of the personal information that we collect or obtain about you, including your credit report, to an environment on our proprietary network that has controls in place to limit access to and secure the data maintained therein. For more information about our security practices, please review our Security Policy at <a href="/policy/security.jsp" name="/policy/security.jsp1" onclick="nextpage=true">http://tui.transunion.com/policy/security.jsp</a>.
   </p><p>
      <strong>How We Use and Share Your Personal Information</strong><br>
      If you indicate to us that you are interested in receiving information regarding other products
      and services your name and e-mail address may be shared with a third party in order to present
      these offers to you. Personal information that is shared with these entities will be monitored in
      accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. If you prefer not to receive such
      information, you may indicate your preference by marking the appropriate box when you register,
      place an order or update your account information, and TransUnion Interactive will not send you any promotional
      materials.
   </p>

   <div class="privacyPolicy indent">
      <p><strong>Emails</strong><br>
         As a service to you, we will email you a receipt of your purchase. Some of our membership products, such as Credit Monitoring, may also include alert emails that are sent on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. These emails are part of the membership benefits and cannot be disabled for persons who are members of these products.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Ordering</strong>
         When you order a credit report or other product or service, TransUnion Interactive must share some of your personal information with third parties in order to process your transaction. For example, TransUnion Interactive must share your name, address and social security number with one or more of the major credit reporting agencies in order to obtain your requested credit report, and must share your name, address and credit card account number with our credit card processing partner in order to process your payment. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Third Parties</strong>
         If you indicated to us when you registered, placed an order or updated your account that you were interested in receiving information about products and services provided by TransUnion Interactive and its marketing partners, your name and email address may be shared with a third party in order to present these offers to you. These entities are only allowed to use shared information for the intended purpose only and will be monitored in accordance with our security and confidentiality policies. In the event you indicate that you want to receive offers from TransUnion Interactive and its marketing partners, your information may be used to serve relevant ads to you when you visit the site.
      </p>
      <p>TransUnion Interactive also may disclose your personal information to third parties in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with, or be responsive to, legal process served on us (such as a subpoena), or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of TransUnion Interactive, our users or others. In addition, we may disclose your personal information to consultants, agents and advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, in the good faith belief that such disclosure is within the scope of their professional duties to TransUnion Interactive and with the understanding that such professionals will abide by our security and confidentiality policies.</p>
      <p>In the event that you unsubscribe from email communications, we may share your email address with our compliance agents or approved marketing partners to prevent you from receiving additional offers.</p>

If you believe that some of the information in your credit report is inaccurate, you must contact the applicable credit reporting agency directly. Information on how to contact the credit reporting agency will be contained in the credit report that you receive if you purchase. In addition, Information about how to contact the three major credit reporting agencies is available under "Disputing Your Credit Information" on our Web site at <a href="/help/handlingInaccuracies.jsp" name="/help/handlingInaccuracies.jsp" onclick="nextpage=true">http://tui.transunion.com/help/handlingInaccuracies.jsp</a>.

   TransUnion Interactive uses two different types of cookies. One type of cookie is used so that our site "recognizes" you each time you return using the same computer, and you do not have to re-enter all your personal information on each visit. You can set your Web browser to refuse to accept this cookie, or delete this type of cookie from your hard drive, and still access our products and services, as long as you re-enter information each time you visit. The second type of cookie is needed so that we can process each step of your transactions with us. If you refuse to accept this type of cookie, you will not be able to access our products and services. Most Web browsers automatically delete this type of cookie when you terminate your session.
   </p><p>
   We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our site or on other sites which we use for advertising. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness; and they are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.
