and <strong>keep</strong> these guidelines.</p>

<a class="close-or-return" href="#" onclick="closeOrRedirect('http://www.trustpilot.co.uk');">Close and return</a> 

<h3>1 Collecting information on the Website</h3>

<p>1.1 Master data</p>

<p>When you create a profile on the Website, we collect the
following master data: Your username, your password and your email
address. The purpose of the collection of this information is to
identify you as user when you log on to the Website. Furthermore,
you can choose to add more information to your profile, such as
your photo and demographical information.</p>

<p>1.2 Reviews</p>

<p>When you make a review of a company, we collect the information
you state in the review, including which company you review, which
purchase(s) the review concerns, and how you evaluate the
company.</p>

<p>1.3 Cookies</p>

<p>The Website uses cookies. Cookies are digital information which
is stored on your computer. The cookie does not identify the
individual user but the user's computer, and it is used for
different purposes.</p>

<p>You can read more about what cookies the Website uses and for
what purposes below.</p>

<p>1.4 IP adresses and browser settings</p>

<p>When visiting the Website, the IP address and the browser
settings of your computer are registered. The IP address is the
numerical address of the computer used when visiting the Website.
Browser settings are e.g. the type of browser you use, browser
language, timezone etc. The IP address and browser settings are
registered to enable Trustpilot to trace the used computer in case
of misuse or unlawful actions in connection with the visit on or
use of the Website. Further, the IP address is used to derive your
approximate location (city level).</p>

<p>1.5 Newsletter</p>

<p>If you sign up for Trustpilot's newsletters, Trustpilot register
the information supplied by you (e.g. your name, email address
etc.). If you no longer wish to receive newsletters from
Trustpilot, you can unsubscribe by logging on to your profile and
edit your information.</p>

<p>1.6 Information from other services, including Social
Network(s)</p>

<p>As part of our services, we provide you with the possibility of
connecting your profile on the Website with your profile on social
networks such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and Twitter ("Social
Network(s)"). Some information about you will automatically be
collected from Social Networks when connecting your Trustpilot
profile with your profile on Social Networks.</p>

<p>The information collected from Social Networks depends on what
information you have made available on the network and your privacy
settings for sharing such information on the network. Depending on
the settings, we may e.g. collect the following information about
you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name and/or username</li>

<li>E-mail address</li>

<li>Gender</li>

<li>Date of birth</li>

<li>Profile photo</li>

</ul>

<p>When you request to have your Trustpilot profile connected to a
profile on a Social Network, you will be informed on which
information we will collect from the network in question before
your request is executed.</p>

<p>The purpose of collecting information from Social Networks is to
connect members of your network, which are both users of Trustpilot
and of one or more of the Social Networks, and thereby both
increase the confidence in the reviews made by the members of the
network as well as create a better user experience on the
Website.</p>

<p>Trustpilot does not collect other personal identifiable
information from visitors of the Website, unless the visitor
provides the information to us.</p>

<p>3.3 Links to websites</p>

<p>The Website contains links to other websites. Note that by

which Trustpilot is not the data controller. We thus recommend that
you always read the personal data policy of these websites, as
their procedure for collecting and processing personal data may be
different from ours.</p>

<p>Trustpilot uses an external company for maintaining the
technical operation of the Website. This company is the data
processor with regards to the personal data for which Trustpilot is
the data controller.</p>

authorize Trustpilot to give such instructions to the data
processor which are necessary for the processing of data in
accordance with this personal data policy and for the purpose of
use of the Website.</p>

organizational safety measures against the information being
accidentally or illegally destroyed, lost or deteriorated, and
against the information coming to the knowledge of unauthorized
persons, is misused or in other ways is processed in violation with
the act on processing of personal data. On your request - and
against remuneration of the data processor's current hourly rates
at any time for such work - the data processor shall supply you
with sufficient information to demonstrate that the above-mentioned
technical and organizational safety measures have been made.</p>

<h3>5 Security measures</h3>

<p>Trustpilot will see to that the recorded data, including the
personal information, is handled carefully and protected properly
following the currently applicable safety standards. Trustpilot
regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and
attacks. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure
environment, Trustpilot cannot ensure or warrant the security of
information you transmit to Trustpilot. Emails sent via the Website
are not encrypted, and Trustpilot therefore advises you not to
communicate any confidential information through these means.</p>
