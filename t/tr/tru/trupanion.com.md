# Privacy Policy - Trupanion

Effective January 1, 2017

**IMPORTANT PRIVACY NOTICE REGARDING YOUR NONPUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION:**

### Why do we have this notice?

At Trupanion, we know the importance of respecting your privacy and maintaining your trust. It is important to us that you understand the measures we have in place to protect your personal information. And, of course, we need to comply with any laws that require us to share with you how we manage this information. Please read this Notice carefully to understand what we do.

### What personal information do we collect?

The types of personal information we collect may include: 

  * Your name, address, email address, and phone number 
  * Information regarding your dealings with us, including policy information, claims history, premiums and payment information.



### How do we collect this personal information?

We collect your personal information, for example, when you: 

  * Apply for insurance, pay premiums, or make changes to your policy 
  * File a claim 
  * Provide employment information 
  * Fill out customer surveys



We also collect personal information from others, such as affiliates, or joint marketing partners or lead providers.

### How might we use or disclose your personal information?

We do not sell your personal information to anyone, for any reason. But all financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday business. In the chart below we list the reasons we might share your personal information, whether we choose to share, and whether you can limit this sharing.

Reasons we can share your personal information | Do we share? | Can you limit this sharing?  
---|---|---  
**For our everyday business purpose** — for example, to process your transactions and otherwise provide the necessary administration of your policy. | Yes | No  
**For marketing purposes** — to offer our products or services to you | Yes | No  
**For joint marketing with other financial companies** — to jointly offer products or services to you | Yes | No  
**For your veterinary service providers** — information to the providers about insurance products purchased and claims filed | Yes | No  
**To prevent fraud, comply with a valid court order, or governmental or regulatory request, or as otherwise required by law** | Yes | No  
**For our affiliates everyday business purpose** — information about your creditworthiness | No | We don't share  
**For non-affiliates to market their products or services to you** | No | We don't share  
  
### How do we protect your personal information?

We use a number of security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.

### Why can’t I limit all sharing

Federal law gives you the right to limit only (i) sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes – information about your creditworthiness; (ii) affiliates from using your information to market to you; and (iii) sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you. State laws may give you additional rights to limit sharing.

### Can I see my personal information?

Yes. You have the right to see and, if necessary, correct personal information. If you wish to review your recorded personal information, please email us at [customercare@trupanion.com](mailto:customercare@trupanion.com?). Please include your name, address, telephone number, and policy number, and let us know what kind of information you want to see. If you see any mistakes, please let us know and we will review it. If we agree, we will correct our files. If we disagree, you may file a short statement of dispute with us. Your statement will be included with any data we disclose in the future.

###  Questions?

Please feel free to call us at (855) 587-7715, or [customercare@trupanion.com](mailto:customercare@trupanion.com?) if you have any questions about this Notice.

### For California Residents:

California law requires an alternate form for your privacy choices, which we are including with this notice. You may exercise these choices using the mailed form or by the other options described in this notice.

### For Canadian Residents:

The information referred to above is stored and processed in the United States at Trupanion’s administrative offices.

### Information for Website users

We also want to make you aware of how we use online data collecting devices known as "cookies". Many commercial Internet websites use "cookies", which are files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences relating to our website. If you disable "cookies" on your browser, the website will not remember your preferences. Our "cookies" are used only when you are visiting our website. While a code in the "cookie" file enables the website to label you as a particular user, "cookies" by themselves do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information. Only you can provide that information on our website — if you expressly choose to do so or if the preferences in your browser choose to do so automatically.

"Cookies" help us understand your website usage. For example, if you have enabled this option, we may use "cookies" to personalize your experience on our website (e.g., to remember your customer ID on a login page). We may also use "cookies" to offer you other products and services that may suit your needs. During the period you are logged into our website, we log Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain name, access times, referral data (the last website address or Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you visited before logging into our website and the first website address or URL you visit after leaving our website), and your activity while using our website. While you may choose to disable cookies via your browser settings, doing so may not allow us to enhance your web user experience. Non-personally identifiable information may be collected, which may be used in website analytics services such as Google Analytics or DoubleClick campaign manager integration. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising and customize Google display network ads by visiting Google Ads settings.

We use the SSL protocol, secure servers, and security protocol to safeguard the information you submit over the internet. Email messages are not secure and may be vulnerable to viewing, alteration, and copying. This website contains links to other websites. We provide links to other websites as a convenience to persons who visit our website. If you choose to use the services provided by those websites, you may be asked by those websites to provide certain personally identifiable information. Please be aware we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites, even if our name or logo appear on those websites. Please be aware that when you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every website that you visit, as the privacy policies of those websites may differ from ours. This privacy statement applies solely to this website.

We also work with third-party internet advertising companies to direct behaviorally-targeted advertising to a variety of our website visitors. You may choose to opt out from participating in behavioral targeted advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt out page: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>. By opting out, you will stop receiving behavioral target ads from your visits to this website, but this does not mean you will be served any non-behavioral ads, nor does opting out stop information from being collected.
