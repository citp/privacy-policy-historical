(4) Regarding Trupanion.com

**

We also want to make you aware of how we use online data collecting devices known as "cookies." Many commercial Internet sites use "cookies." "Cookies" are files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences relating to our website. If you disable "cookies" on your browser, the site will not remember your preferences, and you will not be able to access a customized default home page view of our website. Our "cookies" are only used when you are visiting our site. While a code in the "cookie" file enables the site to label you as a particular user, "cookies," by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information. Only you can provide that information on our website - if you expressly choose to do so or if the preferences in your browser choose to do so automatically, in which case it may identify you by name, address or other personal information.

"Cookies" help us to understand your website usage, so we can continually improve its usability. For example, we may use "cookies" to personalize your experience on our website, if you have accepted this option (e.g., to remember your customer ID on a login page). We may also use "cookies" to offer you other insurance and financial services products that may suit your needs. During the period you are logged into our site, we log IP addresses (a number assigned to your computer when you use the Internet), browser and platform types, domain name, access times, referral data (the last site or URL you visited before logging into our site and the first site or URL you visit after leaving our site), and your activity while using our site.

While you may choose to disable cookies via your browser settings, doing so may not allow us to enhance your web experience. Non-personally identifiable information may be collected for use in Google Analytics features, such as Demographics and Interest Reporting, Remarketing, Display Network Impression Reporting, and DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads by visiting Google Ads Settings.

We use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, secure servers and security protocol to safeguard the information you submit over the Internet. It is important to note that email messages are not secure. Email messages traveling through the Internet are subject to viewing, alteration, and copying by potentially anyone on the Internet.

This website contains links to other sites. We provide links to other sites as a convenience to persons who visit our web site. If you choose to use the services provided by those sites, you may be asked by those sites to provide certain personally identifiable information. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites, even if our name or logo appear on those sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that you visit, as the privacy policies of those sites may differ from ours. This privacy statement applies solely to this website.

We also work with a number of third-party Internet advertising companies to serve behaviorally-targeted advertising to a variety of our website visitors. You may choose to “opt out” from participating in behavioral targeted advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out page: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.

By opting out, you will stop receiving behavioral target ads from your visits to this website, but this does not mean you will be served any non-behavioral ads, nor does opting out stop information from being collected.
