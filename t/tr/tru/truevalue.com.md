This includes your name, address and a phone number where we can reach you. We may keep this information to assist you in the future.

## Online Registration

Registration is an optional service. You do not have to register to browse or shop online. When you register, you are asked for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, a password that you select, and optionally, your interests. Your registration information may be used to help make your online shopping quicker and easier, by pre-filling certain parts of your shopping information.

## General

Our website uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online at our website is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone.
