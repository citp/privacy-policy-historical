We use this information to assist us as we continually assess and improve the products and services we offer.

### Collection and Use of Personal Information

When you purchase items here, we gather the following information from you in order to fulfill and track your order.

  * Your name
  * Recipient name
  * Shipping address
  * Your billing address
  * Your email address
  * Your phone number
  * Your credit card number



### Additional Security Info You Should Know

Our stores, call centers or sites may contact you regarding your order.

### Call Centers

When you contact our Call Center with a question about a product, order status or billing issue you may be asked for information that identifies you -- along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer your question. This includes your name, address and a phone number where we can reach you. We may keep this information to assist you in the future.

### Online Registration

Registration is an optional service. You do not have to register to browse or shop online. When you register, you are asked for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, a password that you select, and optionally, your interests. Your registration information may be used to help make your online shopping quicker and easier, by pre-filling certain parts of your shopping information. When you register you will also have the opportunity to sign up for future marketing information from True Value.

### Passwords

If you choose to register on this site you will be asked to create a username and password. In order to further protect your personal information, please do not share your password with anyone else. If you wish to cancel a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of your password, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/custserv/contactus.jsp).

No “phishing” allowed. We will **never** request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal data through email. This practice, called "phishing", is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from True Value requesting this type of personal information, please delete it.

### Privacy Preferences / Opt-Out 

As a registered user, you may request to see the personal information that we have about you. To access your profile information at any time, go to [My Account](https://web.archive.org/user/main.jsp).

Although you may have opted not to receive marketing communications, you may still get order confirmations, product recall notices or other order-related communications. Since True Value stores are individually owned and operated, you may have to unsubscribe from each store that you receive mail from.

### Contests, Questions or Surveys

When you ask a question, participate in a survey or enter a contest or sweepstakes we may collect your name, address, phone number and email address. We use this information to facilitate your participation in a contest or sweepstakes. At that time we may ask your permission to send you future marketing information from TrueValue.com.

### Here’s an Overview of the Security Measures on Our Site

### General

Security systems aren’t just for protecting your home. Our website uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online at our website is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone. 

Want to know how to identify a secure website? Look at the address of the page. Secure pages will usually appear with an address that starts with "https://" rather than the standard "http://".

### Verified by VeriSign™

We have obtained a VeriSign™ digital security certificate for TrueValue.com. VeriSign™ is an independent third party that authenticates the identity of others on the Internet. By registering with VeriSign™, we provide you a method of independently authenticating that the information you are sending is going to True Value.

### Information About Others

In order to process and / or deliver your order, we may share information with participating True Value retailers and other companies who require it. However, we will not use or disclose any information you provide about someone else for any purpose other than:

1\. To ship the order and confirm delivery

2\. To identify or resolve technical problems or Customer Service issues

3\. As required by law and to comply with a court order or other legal process

4\. To respond to claims that your personalized messages violate the rights of third parties

5\. To protect the rights or property of True Value Company and its affiliates

### Protecting Children’s Privacy

We recognize the importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If a child has provided our website with personally identifiable information, we ask that a parent or guardian [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/custserv/contactus.jsp).

### Information Sharing

If you have opted in to receive additional communication from True Value we may also share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as a printer, mailing house or web host) or that help us market our products and services. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. However, rest assured that these companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.

### Sale of Business

  * If some or all of the business assets of our website are sold or transferred, we would generally transfer the corresponding information about our customers. We also may retain a copy of that customer’s information.



### Legal

For the protection of our website and others, we may disclose information you provide on our website. Especially when we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with the law; to enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property or safety of our website, our users or others.
