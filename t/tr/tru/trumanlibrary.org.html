  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our web site privacy policy 
    is: </font>
  </p><ul>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We consider "personally 
      identifying information" to be: your name or a unique identifier (such as 
      an IP address), your e-mail address, your mailing address, and your telephone 
      number. <br>
      <br>
      </font>
    </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our system does not 
      use "cookies." We consider "cookies" to be computer files that a web site 
      surreptitiously places on your computer system without your knowledge or 
      permission. <br>
      <br>
      </font>
    </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our system collects 
      server log data which will include your IP address, your domain name, the 
      type of browser and operating system you used, the pages you viewed, search 
      requests, in some cases data you submitted via web forms, and, if you linked 
      to our site from another web site, that web site's address. After one month 
      from the time of collection, we aggregate this data and use it for statistical 
      purposes. This is how we discover how many "hits" our site received. The 
      aggregated data helps us to ascertain, for example, the volume of our web 
      site users' interest in portions of our web site, and to help us understand 
      how to improve the navigation and content of our web site. <br>
      <br>
      </font>
    </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Personally identifying 
      information that you provide by email or web forms will be used only for 
      such purposes as are described at the point of collection (for example on 
      a web form), such as to send information or products to you, or to respond 
      to your questions or comments. If you provide contact information, Library 
      staff or its contractors may contact you to clarify your comment or question, 
      or to learn about your level of customer satisfaction with our services. 
      <br>
      <br>
      </font>
    </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We do not sell any 
      personal information to third parties. However, we may share this information 
      in the following cases: </font> 
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A company, that 
          agrees not to sell or use personal information for other purposes, is 
          contracted to assist us with specific services; or </font>
        </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We suspect that 
          you are attempting to change or otherwise damage this web site, or you 
          are using it in violation of Federal or local laws, and we decide to 
          provide personal information to legal authorities. </font>
        </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This information 
          is subpoenaed by Congress or a court. </font>
      </li></ul>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
      </font>
    </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first time that 
      you use an area of our site that utilizes software, such as "Real Player" 
      or "Windows Media Player," it is possible that our site will provide you 
      an opportunity to go to the software manufacturer's web site so you may 
      download a related plug-in that will enable your browser to show you that 
      part of our web site. This prompt occurs because our system can tell whether 
      your browser has the needed capabilities provided by these plug-ins. Our 
      system does not read or place anything on your hard drive when recognizing 
      your browser's capabilities. While the plug-in(s) are needed to view some 
      content, you retain control and choice about conducting the download. At 
      the time that we create and post the web pages that require these software 
      plug-ins for viewing, they are provided by their manufacturer for download 
      and use free of charge. We can not guarantee, however, that the plug-in 
      will remain free, or that the manufacturer will not collect personally identifying 
      information about you when you elect to download the software from their 
      site. If you choose to visit the manufacturer's web site to obtain the plug-in, 
      please carefully review their posted policies for details about personal 
      privacy and use of downloaded plug-ins. <br>
      <br>
      </font>
    </li><li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although questions, 
      comments, and other communications that we receive generally are not retained 
      as permanent records, please note that it is possible that any mail--electronic 
      or paper--that we (or any Federal agency, for that matter) receive could 
      become part of the permanent record of the agency, if the mail is part of 
      materials that are scheduled for permanent retention. </font>
