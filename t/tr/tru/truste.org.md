·        Submitting a Watchdog Report

TRUSTe created the Watchdog Dispute Resolution Mechanism to provide you with a mechanism for reporting and resolving privacy violations, misuse of the trustmark, or specific privacy concerns pertaining to a member Web site. We request your name, email address, name of the Web site, URL, and description of the privacy violation. This information is used to look into the alleged violation and bring it to a satisfactory resolution. Certain personally identifiable information like your name and email address may be shared with the member site, but only if you indicate that we have your explicit permission to do this by marking the appropriate boxes.
