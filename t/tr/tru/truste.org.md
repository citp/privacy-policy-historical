TRUSTe’s Privacy Statement

**

Described below is our privacy policy regarding the information collected on the TRUSTe Web site. 

**

Contact Us

**

We use email links located on the "contact us" page to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard the information. Your personal information is only shared with third parties with your explicit permission.

**

WatchDog

**

TRUSTe created the WatchDog page to provide you with a mechanism for reporting privacy violations, misuse of the trustmark, or specific privacy concerns pertaining to a member Web site. We request your name, email address, name of the Web site, URL, and description of the privacy violation. This information is used to look into the alleged violation to come to a satisfactory resolution. Certain personally identifiable information like your name and email address may be shared with the member site, but only if you indicate that we have your permission to do this by marking the appropriate boxes. If you do not give us your permission to share your personally identifiable information, then we will not share it with anyone outside of TRUSTe. However, in some cases, this may limit our ability to successfully resolve your complaint. Any contact information a user provides on the WatchDog page is optional.

**

Logged Files

**

The TRUSTe Web site logs IP addresses and browser types for systems administration purposes and these logs will be analyzed to constantly improve the value of the materials available on the website. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user’s session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

**

Coordinator`s Site

**

The Licensees Only section asks you to enter your contact information into the Coordinator`s Site. This portion of the Web site is only accessible to TRUSTe licensees. Either a username and password, or confirmation number are required to enter. Contact information may include name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, and domain names. The contact information you enter at the Licensees **** Only **** section (Coordinator`s Site) is used to contact the Site Coordinator should TRUSTe have to work with the site regarding implementation, customer inquiries, and other various reasons. This information also allows us to get in contact with the appropriate people in order to conduct conformance reviews when appropriate. This information is not shared with anybody outside of TRUSTe unless verbal or written permission is given by the Site Coordinator. 

**

Privacy Wizard

**

The TRUSTe Privacy Wizard was designed to help you create a privacy statement. The Wizard asks for information such as company name, Web site name and contact information. The information that is input into the Privacy Wizard is used to generate a privacy statement, however, this information is not saved or captured in any way. The Wizard directs users to address their inquiries to whoever is entered as Web site administrator. Further, the privacy statement generated lets users know how they can contact the Web site administrator depending on what information is entered; mailing address, email address, and/or phone number. Again, this information is not used or captured by TRUSTe. ****

**

**Links**

**

The TRUSTe Web site contains links to other Web sites. We encourage you to visit these Web sites to learn more about online privacy. Please note that these Web sites' privacy policies may differ from those of TRUSTe.

**

Opt-out Policy

**

TRUSTe provides its visitors the option of opting-in as opposed to opting-out. Therefore, when there is a choice of using information for purposes other than what the information was originally collected for, TRUSTe will present the user with an opt-in box. For example, when visitors go to the "enter the drawing", they are presented with an opt-in box, asking if they would like to receive information about TRUSTe. By default, the box is NOT checked. If visitors check the box, a TRUSTe informational package will be emailed to them.
