                       What is a Privacy Statement?
                       A privacy statement is a communication to consumers about how a company
                       uses their personal information. Although businesses of all sorts create
                       privacy policies, this paper focuses solely on public-facing privacy state-

                   Why Post a Privacy Statement?
                   Privacy statements build consumer confidence. A privacy statement signals
                   to consumers that a site respects their privacy concerns and has taken the time
                   to evaluate its privacy practices and institute procedures to protect personal
                   information.
                   Consumer attitudes toward privacy issues have become tougher in recent
                   years. Studies reveal that fewer people trust businesses to handle consumers’
                   personal information in an acceptable way. At the same time, fewer people
                   put faith in existing laws to provide reasonable levels of privacy protection.1
                   Privacy statements help to allay consumer anxieties significantly. More than
                   80 percent of online consumers have read a site’s privacy statement and the
                   remaining percentile report that even a short summary of a site’s privacy
                   practices make them feel more secure online.2

                        Why Post a Privacy Statement?
                        You may be required to post a privacy statement. In recent years, a number
                        of privacy laws have been enacted, forcing many companies to play catch-up in

                   Why Post a Privacy Statement?
                   Posting a privacy statement online is the industry standard. Most Web
                   sites now post an online privacy statement. This trend is in response not only
                   to growing consumer concerns, but also mounting sentiment within the
                   industry that e-businesses were gaining the reputation of being irresponsible

                   forces a company to understand its data-handling practices and may reveal
                   potential liabilities that could threaten and undermine its brand.

                   The need to create a privacy policy too often occasions a company’s first
                   assessment of its data-handling protocol and many companies are surprised
                   to learn that their consumer data is not as well-protected--and its personnel
                   policies not as well-defined--as they may have assumed. Of course, it is
                   always better for a company to uncover any shortcomings on its own rather
                   than having them exposed to the public.

Who Creates a Privacy Statement?
Once there is a general understanding of how data flows through your organi-
zation, operations personnel can begin to dig deeper, usually by asking
questions of the people involved at each level of the data map.
Questions should be directed to any employees that come into contact with
consumer data, including the data engineers who maintain a company’s
information infrastructure, the communications personnel who seed the
customer databases, and the marketing personnel who control use of the
information stored in company databases.
Once you have a detailed understanding of how personal information is
collected, maintained, and used within your organization, the legal or commu-
nications team can step in and draft your privacy statement. At this point the
legal team can also make recommendations about how to improve data-
handling practices if problems are uncovered during the assessment period.
It’s extremely important that all the relevant parts of your organization have an
opportunity to address privacy issues during the process of creating the
privacy policy. If relevant players are left out, not only will the policy be
incomplete, it could also end up short of an accurate picture and land your
company in legal hot water.

                     What does a Privacy Statement Cover?
                     At a minimum, a privacy statement should cover the five elements of the Fair

                     passive. Active collection is the obvious form and involves information that
                     users enter about themselves into Web forms. Usually, this information is for
                     contact (like a name and address), financial (a credit card number), or identifi-
                     cation (a password) purposes. There is also information that sites can pas-
                     sively collect without users actually having to enter anything. Passive infor-

                     should disclose how customer information will be used, including marketing
                     purposes (like cross-selling, list-sharing, joint use), data to third parties, or

What does a Privacy Statement Cover?
Access.
Web sites should allow users access to update or correct information they
have provided online. If direct consumer access cannot be granted, sites
should provide a way for users to request that information be corrected or
updated.
Security.
Web sites should take security precautions to ensure data integrity. Industry
standard is to encrypt all pages asking for Social Security Numbers or credit
card data with Secured Socket Layers (SSLs). Most browsers will notify
consumers when they are on secured pages.
Redress.
Web sites should have a formal process for managing and addressing con-
sumer concerns. At the very least, contact information must be displayed, so
consumers can contact the appropriate employees should privacy issues arise.

                                What are Consumer-Friendly Privacy Practices?
                                The most privacy-conscious companies set rigorous standards for themselves
                                in protecting the privacy of their consumers. This section outlines some of the
                                industry’s best practices.
                                Notice.
Minimize the amount             What information is collected. Although there are many marketing and
of data collected.              research benefits to storing robust databases of consumer information, the less
                                information a company collects, the easier it is to limit disclosures, minimize
                                liability, increase security, and establish trust. While consumers may readily
                                disclose whatever information is required to complete their online transac-
                                tions, they become suspicious of sites that ask for extraneous information.
                                How information is used. Consumer information should not be used for
                                purposes other than what it was obviously intended. For example, if a mailing
                                address is provided for shipment of a product, the same mailing address
                                should not be used to populate lists for catalogs or solicitations, even if they
                                come from the original company that collected the address. The exception to
                                this standard is if a legal procedure requires the disclosure of consumer
                                information. A disclaimer to this extent, however, should certainly be made
                                public in a privacy statement.

                        When making disclosures about security procedures, companies should take
                        care not to disclose too much information to avoid breaches of security.

                        important to many consumers to have an unbiased, outside party weigh both

                          their information.
                          Additionally, a thorough privacy statement should cover privacy practices
                          offline as well as online, if those practices pertain to information collected
