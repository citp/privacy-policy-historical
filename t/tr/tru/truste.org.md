### How We Collect and Use Your Information

#### Watchdog Complaints

We encourage you to use TRUSTe’s [Watchdog Dispute Resolution process](https://web.archive.org/products-and-services/consumer_privacy/about_online_privacy_watchdog) to report and resolve privacy complaints you may have concerning TRUSTe Sealholders or to report misuse of TRUSTe trademarks. If you choose to file a [Watchdog complaint](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request), we collect your name, email, and location. We also request you provide the details around your complaint. Any additional personally identifying information you provide on the [Watchdog Complaint Form](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request) is optional. We will use this information to investigate your complaint and to send you an optional Watchdog Customer Satisfaction Survey once your complaint is resolved.

We will not share your name or contact information with the TRUSTe Sealholder that is the subject of your privacy complaint unless you give us permission to do so. Please be aware, however, that if we cannot share this information, then we may not be able to resolve your complaint.

#### TRUSTe Programs and Services

If you apply to become a TRUSTe Sealholder, we will use the personally identifying information you provide (e.g., your name, address, email address, company information and payment information) to follow up with you about your application and facilitate the certification process.

We also use this information to provide you with customer support and to communicate regularly with you. While providing you with customer support (including through the live chat feature on our website) we may also gather additional information from you. From time to time we will also offer you the opportunity to receive information about privacy-related products or services offered by our third-party partners. We will not share your personally identifying information with these third parties for their marketing purposes, unless we have your permission to do so.

We use information submitted through our Website or collected through email or hard copy surveys to analyze the characteristics of our customers and improve our services. We will occasionally provide anonymized aggregated statistics about our Sealholders in reports made available to them, to third parties, or to the general public. These reports will not identify individual TRUSTe Sealholders.

If you wish to sign up for TRUSTe programs other than the Web Seal Program, or to simply obtain information about TRUSTe programs and services, we will collect your name, email address, phone number, and additional company information. We use this information to contact you about your request, to assist you in the application process or to follow up with you about the programs and services in which you have expressed an interest.

#### TRUSTe Communications

If you sign up for TRUSTe newsletters, webinars, our online behavioral advertising notice opt-out reminder e-mails, or other communications or you want to contact us generally, we will collect your contact information to fulfill your request. To unsubscribe, follow the unsubscribe link that appears at the end of each communication.

#### Consumer Opinion Surveys
