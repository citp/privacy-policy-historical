TRUSTe’s Privacy Statement

**

TRUSTe is the sole owner of the information it gathers on its site.  TRUSTe will not share any of your information with any outside party without your explicit consent unless we are required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on our web site. 

**  What Information is Collected and How it is Used?**

********

·        How to Join

We collect contact information such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.  We also collect company information such as company name and web site URL. We use this information for the purpose of generating an invoice for you to print and submit with the rest of your application materials. 

·        Contact Us

We use email links located on the "contact us" page and other areas of the site to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. This information is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also file your comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard the information. Your personal information is only shared with third parties with your explicit permission.

·         Submitting a WatchDog Report

TRUSTe created the WatchDog Dispute Resolution Mechanism to provide you with a mechanism for reporting and resolving privacy violations, misuse of the trustmark, or specific privacy concerns pertaining to a member Web site. We request your name, email address, name of the Web site, URL, and description of the privacy violation. This information is used to look into the alleged violation and bring it to a satisfactory resolution. Certain personally identifiable information like your name and email address may be shared with the member site, but only if you indicate that we have your explicit permission to do this by marking the appropriate boxes. If you do not give us your permission to share your personally identifiable information, then we will not share it with anyone outside of TRUSTe. However, in some cases, this may limit our ability to successfully resolve your complaint. Any contact information a user provides on the WatchDog page is optional and will not be used for any other purpose than to investigate and respond to your report.

·        For Licensees Only

We also request information within the For Licensees Only section. This portion of the site is only accessible to TRUSTe licensees. Either a username plus password, or confirmation number is required to enter. Your username and password are used to recognize you when you return and to allow you to access your information.  We ask for contact information for the site coordinator and other company personnel. Contact information includes name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, and domain names. The contact information you enter at the Licensees Only section (Coordinator’s Site) is used to contact the Site Coordinator should TRUSTe have to work with the site regarding implementation, customer inquiries and other various reasons regarding the TRUSTe program.  This information also allows us to get in contact with the appropriate people in order to conduct compliance reviews when appropriate. In the event there is a need for a compliance review, TRUSTe will notify the site coordinator and gain their explicit consent to share the contact information entered into the For Licensees Only section of the site with a third party auditor only for the purpose of conducting the compliance review.  TRUSTe will share the contact information entered into this area of its web site if we are required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement agencies, or comply with a legal process served on our web site. 

 ·        Join the Privacy Partnership

Leading online companies have come together along with TRUSTe to bring you the Privacy Partnership campaign. Though this grassroots campaign is the result of the efforts of several companies, the information collected is used solely by TRUSTe and is not shared with any of the privacy partners. 

To demonstrate support of the campaign, we ask companies who would like to add their name to our list of supporters for name, email address, company name, and URL. The contact information requested when a company would like to add its name to the list of supporters of the Privacy Partnership campaign is used only to contact the supporter in direct regards to changes and updates affecting the campaign. The company name that is input is added to the list of supporters, which is shown on the Web site, and is linked to the URL that is entered.  This information is not used for any other purpose.

·        Privacy Wizard

The TRUSTe Privacy Wizard was designed to help you create a privacy statement. The Wizard asks for information such as company name, Web site name and contact information.  It also asks questions in regards to your company’s information collection practices. The information that is entered into the Privacy Wizard is used to generate a privacy statement, however, this information is not saved or captured in any way by our servers.

The TRUSTe Web site logs IP addresses and browser types for systems administration purposes and these logs will be analyzed to constantly improve the value of the materials available on the website.

When there is a choice of using information for purposes other than what the information was originally collected for, TRUSTe will present the user with an opt-in box.  By default, the box is NOT checked. If visitors check the box, then the user is giving TRUSTe their explicit consent to use or share their information solely for the purpose they have agreed to. 

**How to Access and Update User Information**

Reasonable access to personally identifiable information will be provided within 60 days at no cost to the user.  If access cannot be provided within that timeframe, TRUSTe will provide the user a date when the information will be provided.  If for some reason access is denied, TRUSTe will provide an explanation as why access has been denied.
