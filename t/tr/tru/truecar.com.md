By associating a social network account with our Sites, you agree that we may access and retain that information in accordance with the policies of the social network or other online service and this Notice. For example, we may be able to access account or profile information that you have provided to the social network or information about your interactions with the social network to make information available to us (such as when commenting on a blog post or using a sign-on service, such as Facebook Connect).

In addition, we may collect information about your activities on our Sites through the use of cookies, clear GIFs or web beacons, local shared objects or Flash cookies, or through other identifiers or technologies, including similar technologies as they may evolve over time. We refer to these technologies collectively as Metrics Tools.

We may allow third parties to use Metrics Tools on our Sites. The information collected by Metrics Tools may be shared with and used by us, by others acting on our behalf, or by third parties subject to their own privacy policies. Information collected by Metrics Tools may be used on this Site or on other websites or services, including those that may not be operated by us.

We and others acting on our behalf may use the information that we collect or receive to operate our business, including our Sites, as described below:

**Operate and Support our Sites and Services.** We use the information that we gather in order to operate our Sites and our services.

We may also notify a dealer when you are at the dealer’s location via geolocation information that we collect. When you choose to share your contact information with dealers, your direct interactions with those dealers will not be controlled by this Notice. You should review the applicable notices of those dealers to understand how they may use your information.

**Other Contacts.** We may contact you through telephone, text, or chat for other purposes, as permitted by law.

  


This Notice only addresses our own information practices. This Notice does not apply to information you share with third parties, including but not limited to dealers, even if we link to those third parties from a Site. These third parties may have their own privacy policies governing their use of information that you can access from their websites. Our services may be offered through third party websites or mobile applications (“Partner Sites”). This Notice does not apply to Partner Sites, unless otherwise indicated on the Partner Site.
