Trustwave                                                                                     Privacy Policy
1       INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE
      1.1     Introduction
Trustwave Holdings, Inc., (“Trustwave”), and its subsidiaries are committed to maintaining the
privacy, security, and accuracy of your personal information. As a result, Trustwave has developed
this policy to inform you of the steps it has taken to protect your privacy. In addition, Trustwave
and its employees also adhere to strict internal information security policies and procedures to
safeguard your information.
      1.2     Scope of Policy
Because Trustwave respects your right to privacy, it has implemented these privacy practices set
forth below in the provision of its services, products, and website. These privacy practices also
comply with the EU Data Protection Directive and Safe Harbor initiative, (“Safe Harbor”).
Specifically, Trustwave has implemented the following privacy practices, which address the seven
Safe Harbor principles:
              1. Notice: provide types of information collected and how it is used;
              2. Choice: allow individuals to opt out of disclosures;
              3. Onward Transfers to Safe Harbor participants:                        transfer EU citizens personal
                     information only to third parties with adequate security levels;
              4. Access to your Personal Information: allow individuals access to their personal
                     information;
              5. Security: implement protective measures;
              6. Data Integrity: take steps to ensure completeness and accuracy; and
              7. Enforcement: provide readily available independent recourse mechanism.
      1.3     Safe Harbor Participation – EU Data Protection Directive
In order to comply with the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection and provide an
adequate level of protection of personal information, Trustwave has adopted the privacy standards
necessary to participate in the Safe Harbor initiative. The European Union enacted the Data
Protection Directive in order to harmonize member states' laws in providing consistent levels of
protections for citizens and ensuring the free flow of personal data within the European Union. The
directive sets a baseline common level of privacy that not only reinforces current data protection
law, but also establishes a range of certain rights. It applies to the processing and transfer of
personal information in electronic and manual files. A key concept in the European data protection
model is "enforceability." Data subjects have rights established in explicit rules. Every European
Union country has a data protection commissioner or agency that enforces the rules. It is expected
that the countries with which Europe does business will need to provide a similar level of oversight.
The basic principles established by the Directive are: the right to know where the data originated;
the right to have inaccurate data rectified; a right of recourse in the event of unlawful processing;
and the right to withhold permission to use data in some circumstances. For example, individuals
have the right to opt-out free of charge from being sent direct marketing material. The Directive
contains strengthened protections over the use of sensitive personal data relating, for example, to
health, sex life or religious or philosophical beliefs. For more information on the Safe Harbor
initiative, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor.
