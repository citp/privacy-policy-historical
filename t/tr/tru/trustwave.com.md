These third parties may only process the data in accordance with the Trustwave entity's instructions (data processors) or make decisions (e.g., to assess eligibility for supplemental life insurance, short-term disability benefit, etc.) regarding the data as part of the delivery of their services (data controllers). In either instance, Trustwave entities will select reliable suppliers who undertake, by contract or other legally binding and permissible means, to put in place appropriate technical and organizational security measures to ensure an adequate level of protection commensurate with their status as data processors or data controllers. Trustwave entities will require external third party suppliers to comply with this Policy or to guarantee the same levels of protection as Trustwave when handling this data. Such selected third parties will have access to this data solely for the purposes of performing the services specified in the applicable service contract. If a Trustwave entity concludes that a supplier is not complying with these obligations, it will promptly take appropriate actions to remedy such non-compliance or implement necessary sanctions. Occasionally, Trustwave entities may also be required to disclose certain Employment and/or Employee Data to other third parties as a matter of law (e.g., to tax and social security authorities, garnishments, etc.); to protect Trustwave's legal rights (e.g., to defend a litigation suit); or in an emergency where the health or security of an employee is endangered.
