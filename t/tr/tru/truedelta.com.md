# TrueDelta | Privacy Policy

TrueDelta takes your privacy seriously.

Site members supply an email address in order to take part in the research. This email address will never be provided to a third party (aside from email management services TrueDelta might use to send and receive email) without your express consent with regard to a specific offer. We hate spam as much as anyone, and will never provide mailing lists to third parties.

Site members also provide information about themselves and their vehicles via forms on the site and, in some cases, personal email. All information pertaining to the cars, car buying, and the car ownership experience becomes the property of TrueDelta. That said, none of this information (names, license plates, email addresses, etc.) will be published or otherwise publicly released in a form that it can be connected to the individual member or vehicle. For people who are no longer members we will disguise email addresses by partially deleting theme upon request.

For example, while responses to the fuel economy and repair history surveys are posted directly to the site, these posted results and statistics based on data submitted for multiple cars include no way to identify the specific vehicle they pertain to or the person who provided the data unless the member includes personally identifying information in their screen name or in the text of their entry (not advised and rarely if ever done).

For security, data integrity, abuse prevention, and site usage statistics we record timestamps, IP addresses, and a member number when members login and when they enter information.

TrueDelta does not provide data to Carfax, Autocheck, or any other such services that provide information on individual cars.

We use email addresses to send members links to the quarterly car reliability survey and to inform members about site changes and new content. Members can request, manage, and cancel additional notifications for new site content by area, such as new reviews for a specific car model. Members can opt in to receiving questions about the cars they own, and can opt out of this at any time.

Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. TrueDelta uses cookies to maintain a login session (if cookies are blocked a member will be logged out each time they click to a new page) and to limit the number of pages a non-member can view per month. Neither cookie is permanent.

This policy covers how TrueDelta handles the personal information it collects. This includes information that you provide directly via various forms or email and indirectly by using the site (vehicles compared, pages viewed, etc.).

This policy does not apply to any of the websites or companies that TrueDelta links to or otherwise affliates with but does not own or control.

Once you have submitted information and it is received in TrueDelta's database, all submitted information becomes the property of TrueDelta.

We use technical and organizational measures to appropriately protect information that is under our control from unauthorized access collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, or disposal, both during transmission and once we receive it. We store all information on a secure server managed by a large, reputable host. We permit authorized employees and contractors to access information on a need to know basis, as required for their role. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.

Members are responsible for keeping this password complex, secure, and confidential. Passwords can be changed on the Profile page or via a forgotten password link near the bottom of the login page.

Some advertisers use cookies and other means to track your internet use in compliance with internet browser security rules so that they can tailor ads to you. Information includes clickstream data, browser type, time and date, subject of ads clicked on or ignored. They use this information to decide which ads to present to you. The Network Advertising Initiative has an opt out page [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). We have instructed our primary ad supplier, Google, to not use cookies for visitors from the EU.

By using the TrueDelta site and providing us with your information, you agree to the TrueDelta Privacy Policy. If you do not accept this policy, please do not use this site.

TrueDelta reserves the right to modify this policy at any time. Periodically check this page for changes. Continued use of the site implies that you accept any changes.
