# Privacy Policy

Last updated March 26, 2006

## TrueDelta's Privacy Policy

TrueDelta takes your privacy very seriously.

Panel members supply an email address in order to take part in the research. This email address will never be provided to a third party (aside from email management services TrueDelta might use to send and receive email) without your express consent with regard to a specific offer. We hate spam as much as anyone, and will never provide mailing lists to third parties.

Panel members also provide information about themselves and their vehicles, both via the standard forms and, in some cases, personal email. All such information becomes the property of TrueDelta. That said, none of this information will ever be published or otherwise publicly released in a form that it can be connected to the individual member or vehicle. In general all of the information TrueDelta provides will be in aggregate form (averages and the like).

Sometimes, though, it can be helpful to provide an illustrative example in the form of the purchase and/or repair history of a particular car. In this case TrueDelta will alter the details to disguise the actual car involved and/or will receive the explicit permission of the panel member.

There is one exception to this policy. As stated on the panel registration form, TrueDelta reserves the right to contact the appropriate department of motor vehicles (DMV) or equivalent to verify the existence of a vehicle in the panel. Even in this case no information will be provided to the DMV that the DMV does not already possess.

## What This Policy Covers

This policy covers how TrueDelta handles the personal information it collects. This includes information that you provide directly via various forms or email and indirectly by using the site (vehicles compared, pages viewed, etc.).

This policy does not apply to any of the websites or companies that TrueDelta links to or otherwise affliates with but does not own or control.

## Ownership of Information

Once you have submitted information and it is received in TrueDelta's database, all submitted information becomes the property of TrueDelta.

## Acceptance of These Terms

By using the TrueDelta site and providing us with your information, you agree to the TrueDelta Privacy Policy. If you do not accept this policy, please do not use this site.

## Policy Changes

TrueDelta reserves the right to modify this policy at any time. When a substantial change is made (i.e. beyond wording such that the meaning of the policy is altered), the change will be communicated in the email periodically sent to panel members (generally once per month). Please periodically check this page for changes. Your continued use of the site means you accept any changes.
