# Trumba Privacy Policy

###### Last Revised: June 19, 2019

Trumba Corporation (“ **Trumba** ”) provides and hosts for its clients (“Clients,” or “you) customizable web calendars including event promotion and registration tools. When you use the calendar functionality, Trumba also makes available to you online calendar, scheduling, reminder, event information and publishing, and email and text messaging services. Together, the calendar functionality and the additional functionalities offered on client calendars shall be referred to as the “Services,” which may be accessed directly from the Trumba website or through your web sites when you publish online calendars.

This Privacy Policy explains how Trumba collects, uses and discloses information when you use our Services or otherwise interact with us. In order for you to make use of Services, you will need to register for an account. If you register for a personal account, where you are the only intended user of the calendar, please note that personal accounts are not intended for and should not be used by Clients in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). If you sign up for an account and you intend to allow others, such as your customers or end users to use the calendar services, you have an enterprise account and are considered to be an enterprise user. 

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

When we use the term “ **Personal Information** ” we mean any information that identifies an individual, such as (but not limited to) an individual’s name, email address, postal address, device-specific information and log information (as described below). Any information that does not, on its own, identify an individual person is considered and treated as non-personal information. When non-personal information is combined with other information so that it does or can be used to identify an individual, this information is treated as Personal Information.
