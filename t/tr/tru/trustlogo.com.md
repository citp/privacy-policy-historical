**Re-Targeting**

Comodo permits the operation of a retargeting consumer marketing program, including, but not limited to, the provision of anonymous consumer information to a third-party provider of such a program. A link to the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer opt-out page is located at [www.networkadvertising](http://www.networkadvertising.com/) .org/managing/opt_out.asp and allows the consumer to opt-out of such retargeting programs.

**Log Files**

Comodo uses log files comprising of non-personally identifiable information to analyze trends, administer the site, track movements throughout the site, calculate the number of document and file downloads, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Information provided to Comodo will be protected by Comodo and not sold or rented to any unrelated third parties without the express consent of the information provider, except that Comodo may disclose data to its affiliates and business partners who have established similar privacy standards, when legally obligated to do so, or if disclosure is required to protect the rights over Comodo, Comodo's customers, or the users of Comodo's services. Comodo may also share aggregate demographic data that does not contain any personally identifiable information.

Validation is an essential step in receiving a Certificate from Comodo CA. This validation may require verifying your information with a third party as described in the Comodo CPS. Comodo CA may disclose the information provided to the extent necessary to verify the certificate application.
