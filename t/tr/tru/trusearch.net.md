At TruSearch, we respect the privacy of our customers and we've created this privacy statement so that you have easy access to information about our privacy practices.

The instances in which TruSearch does collect and use information are specifically described in this Privacy Policy.

  2. **Information we request, and how we use it**

In several areas during applying as an advertiser or publisher we ask you to provide various information by filling out and submitting an online form. We ask for your name, address and contact information so we can send you your account details, and so we can contact you if we have a question. We do not share or sell your personal information, including email addresses.

Occasionally, we send a TruSearch Newsletter, our email update on sales and products, to opt-in subscribers who we feel are interested in learning about sales and special events at our website. Unsubscribe instructions are included in each edition of the newsletter so that you may unsubscribe at any time.
