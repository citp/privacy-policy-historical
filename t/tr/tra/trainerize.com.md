    * By directly or indirectly accessing or making use of the services offered or made available by TSR Gym Technik Ltd.(the “ **Vendor** ”), including without limitation the Trainerize software as a service platform, and any website, application or widget associated therewith (the “ **Services** ”), and/or by clicking the acceptance button, you signify, represent and warrant that you are older than 16 years of age and that you have, and at all times shall have, the necessary power, capacity and authority to enter into, abide by, comply with and perform your obligations under this privacy policy (this “ **Privacy Policy** ”).
    * The Vendor is committed to protecting the personal information of identifiable individuals and legal entities, disclosed or provided to the Vendor on or through the Services (the “ **Personal Information** ”), and this Privacy Policy outlines how the Vendor collects, uses and discloses such Personal Information.
    * The Vendor reserves the right to, at its sole discretion, amend this Privacy Policy at any time and without notice, the most current version of which shall always be available at http://www.trainerize.com/privacy.aspx. You acknowledge and agree that your continued use of the Services, following any amendment of this Privacy Policy, shall signify your assent to, and acceptance of, such amended terms and conditions.
    * If you do not agree to any term or condition of this Privacy Policy, or any subsequently amended term or condition thereof, you cannot use the Services.
  2. Collection and Use of Personal Information 
    * You expressly acknowledge, agree and consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information as specified in this Privacy Policy. The legal bases for our processing of Personal Information are primarily that the processing is necessary for providing the Services and that the processing is carried out in our legitimate interests, which are further explained below. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Vendor may on occasion, in specific circumstances, ask you to consent when the Vendor intends to collect or use your Personal Information.
    * In the event that you choose to register as a user of the Services, you will be asked to create a unique username and private password (collectively, the “ **Access ID** ”) which will be used to create and activate an account through which the Vendor can make the Services available to you (the “ **Account** ”). You expressly acknowledge and agree that certain information such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, billing information, financial information, and certain additional information may be required by the Vendor to make the Services available to you, or may be disclosed by you on or through the Services.
    * We take steps designed to ensure that only those employees who need access to your Personal Information to fulfil their employment duties will have access to it. You expressly acknowledge, agree and consent to the Vendor collecting and using your Personal Information: 
      * to create and activate your Account;
      * to respond to any request for customer service;
      * to make the Services available to you and to other users of the Services;
      * as necessary to allow the Vendor to provide you with access to and use of the added services, features and functionality of the Vendor’s partner organizations, as incorporated into and/or linked to the Services;
      * to improve the quality of the Services, including without limitation, through polls, surveys and other similar feedback gathering activities conducted by the Vendor or any third-party;
      * to assess service levels, monitor traffic patterns and gauge popularity of different features, functionalities and service options of, or related to, the Services;
      * to create and manage your Account, and to verify access rights to the Services;
      * to bill, or render invoices relating to, your Account, and to collect any debt owing to the Vendor, and to facilitate payments between you and other users of the Services as contemplated by the features and functionality of the Services;
      * to communicate with you, including without limitation for the purpose of providing you with notifications, content, marketing materials, commercial electronic messages, and information about your Account and/or the Services;
      * to install software relating to the Services, on one or more of your electronic devices;
      * to protect against fraud or error, and to respond to claims of any violation of the Vendor’s rights or those of any third-party;
      * to protect the rights, property or personal safety of yourself, the Vendor, the Vendor’s agents, the Vendor’s users and the public;
      * to enforce this Privacy Policy, or any other agreement entered into between yourself and the Vendor;
      * as required to comply with any applicable laws, or as authorized by any applicable laws; and
      * for other purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, and for any other purpose the Vendor may disclose to you from time to time.
    * You may at any point withdraw your consent to receive the communications set out in Section 2(c)(viii). The Vendor provides an “opt-out” function within all email communications of this nature, and/or will cease communications of this nature if you inform the Vendor that you would like to “opt-out”. You however expressly acknowledge and agree that you may not “opt-out” of communications related to the Services, your Account, a bill, an invoice, or where such withdrawal of consent would frustrate the performance of a legal obligation (but the Vendor will attempt to minimize the aforementioned communications).
  3. Disclosure of Personal Information 
    * The Vendor will only disclose your Personal Information as set out in this Privacy Policy in accordance with your instructions, for the purposes set out in Section 2(c), and in any event, in accordance with applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you understand and agree that the purposes set out in Section 2(c) include the disclosure of your Personal Information to the Vendor’s partner organizations in connection with your use of the functionality of the Services. For example, if you utilize the meal planning functionality of the Services, your Personal Information may be shared with the Vendor’s partner organization that provides such meal planning service functionality.   You expressly acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information disclosed by the Vendor to others hereunder may be subject to the terms of another privacy policy other than this Privacy Policy, and that the Vendor assumes no responsibility for the privacy policies or practices of any third-party. 
    * Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage third party service providers. By using the Services, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than in your country. While such information is outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country. However, our practices regarding your Personal Information will at all times continue to be governed by this Privacy Policy and, if applicable, we will comply with the _General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR")_ requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of Personal Information from the EU/EEA to third country.
    * You expressly acknowledge, agree and consent to the disclosure of your Personal Information as specified in this Privacy Policy. When we disclose your Personal Information to third parties, we take reasonable measures to ensure that the rules set forth in this Privacy Policy are complied with and these third parties provide sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures.
    * Without limiting the foregoing, you expressly acknowledge and agree that, for the purposes of billing your Account and facilitating payments between you and other users of the Services as contemplated by the features and functionality of the Services, in each case if applicable, the Vendor may disclose your Personal Information with its Payment Processing Services Provider (as defined in the Terms of Service), banks or other third-parties in order to process payments.
  4. Retention of your Personal Information

If we learn that Personal Information has been collected on the Services from persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
