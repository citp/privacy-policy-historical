					<h2 id="documenti">Confidentiality of Your Documents</h2>
					<p>
						Translated shall make every effort, in regard to the electronic form of the service, to keep all documents and personal customer information absolutely confidential.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Information relating to the translation, the nature of the translation and any information the Customer transmits to Translated shall be treated with complete confidentiality. Translated shall not publicly divulge in any way this information without previous written authorization from the customer, with the exception of collaborators or subcontractors previously authorized by Translated and the Customer who require such information to perform their jobs.
					</p>
					<p>
						These guarantees shall not be applicable in the event that Translated is required by law to communicate such information, or in the event that such information becomes public domain, independently of divulgement of such information by Translated.
					</p>
					
					<a href="#big-text" class="rightarrow scroll"></a>
					<h2 class="redb" id="privacy">Privacy Statement</h2>
					<p>
						Translated has written this privacy statement to demonstrate its complete respect of your privacy. The text below describes the practices for collecting and distributing information in Translated's possession. This document refers to the following domains:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.translated.net/" class="extlink" target="_blank">Translated.net</a></li>
			  </ul>
					
					<a href="#big-text" class="rightarrow scroll"></a>
					<h2 class="blueb" id="information">Automatically Collected Information</h2>
					<p>
						We use your IP address (the one that unequivocally identifies the host at that particular time) and cookies to identify you while you make purchases on our site.<br> Translated uses a form to acquire information related to an order. In addition to the full name of the person placing the order, information for billing and future contacts is also registered. Translated is not given information related to credit cards - they are instead directly managed on Banca Sella's secure credit card processing server.
					</p>
					<a href="#big-text" class="rightarrow scroll"></a>
					<h2 class="greenb" id="newsletter">Newsletter &amp; emails</h2>
					<p>
						We send you emails for a variety of reasons. These may include confirmations of orders or registrations. Our communication may also include information about our services, provided you have not revoked your consent for such usage, which you can of course do at any time at <a href="//www.translated.net">www.translated.net</a> or by writing to <a href="mailto:info@translated.net">info@translated.net</a>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Any emails we send are saved by us and any emails that may be regarded as business letters will not be deleted during the statutory retention period. Furthermore, in the case of our newsletter emails, we record (e.g. by means of a so-called “tracking pixel”) whether an email is opened and which links in the email are clicked on; we do so to optimize our offers and tailor their design to meet your needs. We use this data to enable us to send newsletter contents that matches your profile. 
					</p>
					<p>
						If you wish to object to this use of your data, you can do so by unsubscribing to our newsletters. We also use service providers from the USA to send our emails. We make sure that the statutory conditions for the cross-border use of personal details are fulfilled.
					</p>
					
					
					<a href="#big-text" class="rightarrow scroll"></a>
					<h2 class="greenb" id="collaborators">Supplier and Collaborator Privacy</h2>
					<p>
						The personal information of our suppliers and freelance collaborators (suppliers, translators, interpreters, graphic designers, affiliates, consultants etc.) are processed with utmost confidentiality. The only information which is provided to third parties is the information published on our site: your username, your native language, experience and educational background. Other information including full name, date of birth, addresses and telephone numbers are only used by Translated and its authorized suppliers (e.g. accounting firms, banks, etc.) for purposes related to current jobs.
					</p>
					
					<a href="#big-text" class="rightarrow scroll"></a>
					<h2 class="blueb" id="delete">Right to Change or Delete Information</h2>
					<p>

					<h2 class="blueb" id="cookies">Navigation data and cookies</h2>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 15px;">Navigation data</h3>
					<p>The computer systems and programs used for the website's operation collect some personal data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols (e.g. IP addresses or domain names of computers used by users who connect to the site, URI [Uniform Resource Identifiers] of resources requested, the time of request, method used to submit the request to the server, file size obtained in response, numerical code for the status of the response submitted by the server - successful, error, etc., and other parameters relating to the user's operating system and computer environment). Although this sort of information is not collected to be associated with identified users, through processing and in association with data held by third parties, it could by its very nature allow for users to be identified.</p>

					<p>These data types are used solely to obtain statistical information pertaining to the website's usage and serve to check the site's correct operation; they are thus not associated with any given user ID and are deleted immediately after processing. The data could be used to ascertain responsibility in the case of computer crimes against the site: with the exception of this eventuality, data on web contacts are currently not held for more than seven days.</p>

					<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Cookies</h3>
					<p>What are cookies? Cookies are small text files sent by websites visited by users to their computers, storing information that will be retrieved on the next visit to the site.

					<p><b>Functionality</b> cookies: the website uses these cookies to facilitate its fruition (e.g. to store information gathered within a single web browser session and entered by users in forms&nbsp;while surfing through the different pages, or the use of the password memorization function), as well as cookies for collecting information with the aim of directing targeted promotional messages based on user preferences and profiles, even in real time, and developed on the basis of statistics and each user's browsing experience. The installation of such cookies requires the user's prior consent.</p>

					<p><b>Analytics</b> cookies: the website makes use of this type of cookies to analyse accesses and visits to the site, solely for statistical purposes, by collecting information in an aggregated form.

For further information, please refer to the privacy policy of Google Analytics, Google Adwords and Twitter.</p>

					<p>Users have the right to accept or refuse the use of cookies at any time, or to remove any cookies previously accepted by changing their browser settings. The following links provide an overview of how to disable cookies on your browser:</p>

					<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Social features</h3>
					<p>If users log in using the access credentials of a social networking site (e.g. Facebook or Google+, hereinafter generically referred to as <strong>"Social Channels"</strong>) i.e. associating their account to a User account on a <em>Social Channel</em>, including Twitter, the company may receive data relating to the User from the <em>Social Channel</em>, in accordance with the conditions of use and the <em>Social Channel's</em> privacy policy provisions. The company can add this information to the user data already collected through its services.
