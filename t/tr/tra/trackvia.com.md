1\. We do not reveal any personal information that we collect about you, nor any information or data that you store in your Account, to anyone else. We will share your personally identifiable information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.

During the registration process, TrackVia collects personally identifiable information (Required Information: First Name, Last Name, Email Address and Optional Information: Organization Name and Phone Number) from the Subscribing Organizations and their Users. Individuals who sign up are also required to create a user name and password for their account. TrackVia uses this information to communicate with organizations during the demo period via email and phone outreach to help get organizations up and running. In addition, TrackVia sends a monthly newsletter to all users who have not opted out of receiving email correspondence from TrackVia. TrackVia may also collect personally identifiable information at other times, such as when responding to product support inquiries. This information is only used to contact the user to help resolve support inquiries. TrackVia may also contact the user via email to announce improvements to the TrackVia interface. In addition, the TrackVia application allows you to store data and information that is personally identifiable, private, or sensitive. TrackVia may use such information in the aggregate only for its own internal purposes. Account administrators also input their Credit Card information (card type, name on card, billing address, city, state, zip, country, card number and expiration date) when signing up for a paying account. Credit card numbers are stored with payment gateway [ **AUTHORIZE.NET**](http://authorize.net/) and no TrackVia employee can see credit card numbers. We will not sell, rent or release a Subscribing Organization’s or User’s personally identifiable information, application data, or stored information to any other party, except at the request of the Subscribing Organization or under certain rare special circumstances such as court order.

2\. TrackVia analyzes information about you only on a basis that does not personally identify you. In order to improve our Service, provide content and develop applications and services that are useful to our Subscribing Organizations and Users, TrackVia may automatically gather information on an aggregate basis about the applications, services and pages of the TrackVia application that Users visit and use. A Subscribing Organization’s or its Users’ personally identifiable information cannot be linked to or discerned from any of this information. TrackVia may also use demographic information and profile data about Subscribing Organizations and Users for these purposes.

3\. TrackVia does not use personally identifiable information to track site visitors. However, once a visitor chooses to create a demonstration account, then TrackVia is able to link a customer’s personally identifiable information (First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Organization Name and Phone Number) via a cookie. In order to offer our Services and to enable certain application features and functionality, TrackVia uses cookies. Cookies are used to determine when a users’ account has been inactive for four hours. For security purposes, TrackVia automatically logs users out of an account that has been inactive for over four hours. Cookies are also used to identify IP addresses of site visitors enabling us to determine site pages visited. This information is only used internally to identify opportunities to improve our website and application.

If you choose to use our referral service to inform someone about our site, we will request their name, email address, company name, and phone number.
