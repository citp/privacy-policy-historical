The advertisements that you see displayed on this website are delivered on our behalf by a third party advertising company.

**Security**

Our website is a "VeriSign Secure Site" and keeping information about you secure is very important to us. However, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk. Sensitive information, for example, your security information and credit card details, is encrypted to minimise the risk of interception during transit.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a very small text file placed on your computer by a web browser, which has been sent by a web server. It is essentially an "identification card" relating to you. The main purpose of our cookies is to identify you when you visit our website. Each time your browser requests a web page from our server, the browser sends the information in the text file back to the server and lets the server know that you have returned to that web page. We use cookies to provide you with a better service tailored to suit you. We will store your cookies for a maximum of three months.

Cookies help you to save time. For example, if you register for our Services, a cookie helps us to remember who you are and what your preferences are. Next time you return, we can fill in any questions that you have already answered. The more you tell us about yourself, the more we can help to find information or products you want.

If you do not accept incoming cookies then the performance of our website on your system will not be to full standard or our website may not serve at all.

**Transferring your information abroad**

Information supplied by you to us will only be transferred abroad by us or our agents for the purpose of performing contractual obligations to you, or when you have given your prior consent to such transfer.

**Your Rights**

You have certain rights under the Data Protection Act 1998. For example, we will always let you have a copy of all personal information we have about you should you request it. We may charge you a fee for a copy of such information.
