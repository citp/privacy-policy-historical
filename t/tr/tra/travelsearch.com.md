# KAYAK - Privacy Policy

_Effective as of May 1, 2013_

Our goal is to make KAYAK the most trusted company in online travel.

KAYAK is a search engine that saves you time and money. We search the web for the best fares and rates to help you make your purchase. Registration on KAYAK is strictly voluntary. You do get some valuable information and access to certain great features if you do register, but membership is not necessary to get our great rates and fares.

### What's Your Sign?

KAYAK does not collect any of your personally identifiable information (“PII”) when you do basic searches on the site. However, certain services we provide require you to authorize us to collect PII, including your name (and the traveler name, if different), email address, phone number, password, credit card information, passport number and billing address. Our software uses the PII to personalize and manage the KAYAK website for you. Here are some examples of services we can provide if you authorize us to use your PII:

With your credit card information and billing address, we can facilitate your reservations.

Your name, travel dates, destination, itinerary, supplier (airline, hotel etc.), passport number, email address, telephone number, credit card information and billing address may be necessary to process your booking on our site and/or to provide you valuable information about our services or those of our partners.

If you choose KAYAK personal trip management service (the “My Trips Service”), you authorize us to collect your travel information in order to create and maintain your travel itineraries.

So, remember, if you do decide to use any of these KAYAK services and give us PII about you, you are telling us that this PII is true, accurate and current. Also, you are telling us that you have the authorization to provide us with that PII. 

In order to make our site more efficient, we may also collect certain information (such as destination or site usage behavior) based on your use of KAYAK. We may use this information to display advertising that you find interesting and suppress advertising that you might find boring or annoying. For example, we might show you travel offers from your home airport. Also, we may use this information to send you targeted email-marketing messages that you might find interesting. 

To help us debug problems with our software, we may collect some technical information from your browser software (such as Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer), screen resolution and the website that referred you to us.

### We'll Keep You In The Loop

When you choose to register with us, KAYAK logs you in automatically using your email address. This makes it easier as you don't have to create and remember a login identifier. The use of your email address for login also allows KAYAK to assist you with forgotten passwords issues. If you do register with us, or otherwise provide us your e-mail address, KAYAK will save your information and recognize you regardless of where you login. So if you are using a friend's computer or mobile device, we'll know it's you and display your searches and preferences when you do login. 

From time to time, KAYAK may send you emails that we think are of interest to you regarding our services or those of our partners. Our emails are sent from a KAYAK address and are sent to your real email address. We will retain your e-mail address for such use If you are either a registered user and send email booking confirmations to our My Trips Service, or if you are not a registered user but previously provided us your e-mail address. Oh, and if you’ve never registered on KAYAK and you send us email booking confirmations, we’ll send you an email asking you to register. We’ll also send you an email if you send us your email booking confirmations but we are unable to recognize the travel provider or otherwise to create your consolidated itinerary. Every email that we send has an opt-out URL, so you can be unsubscribed when you want.

### In This Case Sharing Is Not Caring

We may share information you provide us with third parties for our legitimate business purposes, including vendors who perform services on our behalf. For example we may share your name, contact information, and billing information with our vendors in order to process your booking request. We may also share your information from time to time as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. 

What's yours is yours. We won't sell your name, email address, phone number, credit card information, passport number or billing address to anyone. There might be an exception in the event KAYAK itself is sold or if there is otherwise a change in corporate ownership. In this case we would transfer your PII to our buyers so that they could continue to provide the same great KAYAK service. Also, if you use the My Trips Service, you can send, or grant access to, your itinerary to your friends and family. Once displayed on publicly-viewable web pages, that PII can be collected and used by others.

If you book on our site, we will share your PII with the selected hotels, airlines and car rental companies to complete your booking and/or to comply with applicable law. We may also share this PII with our corporate affiliates.

From time to time, we will also share aggregated usage information with others. This type of information does not contain your identity or anything personally identifiable to you.

### If The Police Come Knocking At Our Door

KAYAK may disclose to authorized law enforcement personnel the PII from anyone who poses a threat to our interests. This might include those that are attempting to commit fraud or those who conduct activities that could bring harm to us or others. We assume that this is not you so please don't worry. KAYAK may also disclose information about you in response to a legal action or where otherwise required by law, to enforce our rights, to professionals who provide services to us, and generally to service providers who perform services on our behalf and have agreed in writing to protect and not further disclose your information.

### You Are The Boss

KAYAK members and site visitors have control over the use of their personal data. Since you are the boss on KAYAK, you always can change your account settings in the "My Profile" page on KAYAK. Further, you can always delete your account [here](https://web.archive.org/zap) (or send us an e-mail at if you provided us your e-mail address and want it removed from our database).

### Protecting Your Information

KAYAK has a security program intended to keep the PII stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access. We store your PII in secure data centers located in the United States and in Switzerland. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Third party security firms review our internal security policies and documentation regularly. PII may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third party vendors, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy. The bottom line is, when it comes to information security, we mean business.

### Accessing and Correcting your Information

If you have submitted PII to us and would like to have access to it, or if you would like to have it removed or corrected, please contact us using the contact information provided below. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request; however, in some cases we may not be able to allow you to access certain PII in certain circumstances, for example if it contains PII of other persons, or for legal reasons. In such cases, we will provide you with a reasonable explanation of why it is not possible to grant access to your PII.

### Cookies (Not The Kind You Eat With Milk)

When you visit KAYAK we may store information about your web session and assign you one or more 'cookies'. Your browser will store these cookies on you computer or mobile device in a small file. For example, when you decide to login as a KAYAK member, we store encrypted information. We and our advertising partners may use transparent pixels that, if used, allow us and our advertising partners to track website usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed and whether and when you have opened a HTML email. You may turn off your cookies using your browser settings, but this will affect your use of our website.

KAYAK does make money by selling advertising as well as referrals from searches on our site. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use PII (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

### We Will Email You Sometimes

With the exception of emails confirming registration, emails that include information about your account, emails relating directly to an itinerary, travel profiles or reservations created through the My Trips Service, and service announcements and administrative messages that are considered part of your account membership, we will give you the ability to control communications you receive from us. This might include information we believe will be of use and interest to you, including targeted email marketing messages. If you decide that you are no longer interested in receiving email marketing communications from us, you may follow the instructions in our marketing emails to unsubscribe from our marketing email list.

### Every Website Has Its Own Voice and Policies

Although we work with responsible third parties, their business policies may include different privacy policies and practices than we have. So when you click through to third party websites, our privacy policies no longer apply. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these provider websites.

### Big Kids Only Please

KAYAK does not knowingly collect PII from minors. If we become aware of the fact that a minor is attempting to submit this PII, we will inform the minor that he or she is ineligible to do so. We will then remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us PII, you may contact us to delete it.

### Our Website is Run from the United States

Our website is run from the United States and is intended for U.S. customers; our servers and data centers are located in the U.S and in Switzerland. If you are accessing our website from outside the U.S., by providing us PII about you, you agree that the PII may be transferred and stored in the U.S. and in Switzerland, each a jurisdiction which may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security protections than those of your own jurisdiction. As a result, your PII may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those jurisdictions according to laws in those jurisdictions. Subject to the applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will provide appropriate safeguards to maintain protections on your PII.

### Should We Evolve, Change, Self Actualise

KAYAK reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If there are material changes to this statement on how KAYAK will use your PII, we will prominently post these changes prior to implementing them and if you are registered with us, attempt to email you using your current email address on record with us regarding these material changes.
