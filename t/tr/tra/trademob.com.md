## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information on our privacy and data protection policies and does inform you with regard to this website about what data we collect, how we process it and for what purpose. Safeguarding your privacy is of paramount importance to us, our policies reflect industry best practice. We may change this policy at any time in which case we will issue a new version of this document, available for download from our website. You may wish to visit our website from time-to-time to ensure you have our latest Privacy Policy.

**What sort of data do we collect on this website?**

We automatically collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit this website and use this information to help us understand how people use our Site. Our website can be visited without providing any personal information.

Therefore, we do not collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email, address, credit card information, or anything else that can personally identify you on behalf of our clients. However, where we receive requests for information, direct emails or other communications sent to Trademob, outside of the work we do on behalf of our clients, we may hold this PII.

**How does our technology work?**

Our technology uses technologies such as anonymous pixel tags or anonymous cookies to make the mobile advertisements you see more relevant to you and also to help us understand browsing and buying habits so that we can measure the success of our clients’ mobile advertisements. Any such profiling is done by using an anonymizer and by segmenting profiling data. Data collected by Trademob is only retained in an aggregated form, so that information about an individual cannot be retrieved. All the data we hold is protected by multiple layers of physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, to secure it against accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, disclosure, loss or destruction.

**What happens to the data we collect?**

From time-to-time we may share the aggregated, non-individual specific, data we hold with Publishers and Networks for reporting and accounting purposes, as well as other unaffiliated third parties for various purposes such as statistical or educational analysis. In these cases we work with organisations we believe to have appropriate safeguards in place to protect data at the levels we require. In situations where we are obligated by law, we may also disclose information in order to comply with such requests.

**How can you take control of your privacy?**

You may choose to opt out of the Trademob advertising program at any time by clicking here. This will not prevent you from seeing mobile advertising but Trademob will neither store, nor use any information regarding your interests to tailor the adverts you may be seeing. If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests. This opt-out applies only to Trademob advertising services and does not affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks. This opt-out functionality is cookie-based. In order for the opt-out to work on your computer, your web browser must be set to accept third-party cookies. You can configure your web browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you buy a new computer, change web browsers, or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again in case you still do not wish the advertising cookie to be served to you.
