This site is owned and operated by [Traffic-Splash.com](http://www.traffic-splash.com/). Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Traffic-Splash.com, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. 

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

Definition of the Information Traffic-Splash.com gathers and keeps track of. 

Traffic-Splash.com gathers two types of information about users: 

1\. Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive more information on our services, special promotions or to receive our newsletter. 

2\. Information Traffic-Splash.com gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Traffic-Splash.com derives its revenue mainly from its services, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our services tailored to our users. Under no circumstances does Traffic-Splash.com divulge any information about an individual user to a third party.

### Traffic-Splash.com Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:

### OPTIONAL VOLUNTARY INFORMATION

We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users: 

1\. **Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)**

We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Traffic-Splash.com gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration. 

2\. **"E-mail this to a friend" Service**

Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose. 

3\. **Polling**

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Traffic-Splash.com may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users. 

4\. **Surveys**

Traffic-Splash.com may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party. 

### USAGE TRACKING

Traffic-Splash.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Traffic-Splash.com does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). 

Traffic-Splash.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

### COOKIES
