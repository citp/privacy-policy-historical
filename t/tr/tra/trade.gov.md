Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting an International Trade Administration (ITA) web site. ITA promotes U.S. exports, protects U.S. business interests abroad and enforces U.S. trade laws. In support of these activities, ITA is occasionally required to collect business or personal information from our customers. We do not collect this type of information without the voluntary consent of the site visitor.

The main purpose of this policy is to inform our visitors that you have rights under the Privacy Act, that all business or personal information provided to ITA is on a voluntary basis, and that information provided will be protected to the extent permitted by the [Privacy Act of 1974](http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/privstat.htm) and the [Freedom of Information Act of 1966](http://www.usdoj.gov/04foia/foiastat.htm). At each location where information is collected, we make every effort to explain explicitly how the information you provide will be used, and we allow you to determine if you consent to provide such information.

Voluntarily submitting information constitutes your consent for ITA to use the information for the purpose stated and indicates to us you are aware of ITA's Privacy Policy provisions.

If you register on one of our web sites to obtain a benefit, report a trade complaint or use any of our services, you may submit personally identifiable information, such as name, title, name/size of company, or address. Certain ITA services are reserved for U.S. firms and we may use the registration information to contact you for verification purposes before allowing access to the requested service. Information collected from the public on our websites has been authorized by [_The Office of Management and Budget (OMB)_](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/index.html) as required under the [_Paperwork Reduction Act_](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/pra_memo111401.pdf).
