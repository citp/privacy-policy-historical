Thank you for visiting Trans-Siberian Orchestra's official web site. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used on this site. 

By registering on our web site, you agree to our collection and use of your personal information as outlined below.

We will not share with or disclose to third parties any personally identifiable information without your prior consent, except as set forth herein. 

Agents and contractors of Trans-Siberian Orchestra (and the related companies that operate, design, maintain and host this site) who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for the Trans-Siberian Orchestra official web site. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosure may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identity in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data. 

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request or if we believe, at our sole discretion, that there is reasonable concern to notify a law enforcement agency about suspicious, threatening, obscene or slanderous content on any section of the web site. 

We may use personally identifiable information to contact you about participating in surveys, to respond to your inquiries, to notify you about Trans-Siberian Orchestra-related events and to notify you of any prizes you may have won. We also may use this information to notify you about changes in our Privacy Policy. The Trans-Siberian Orchestra official web site makes every effort to ensure that your information is secure on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. As a result, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra official web site cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

TSO Fan Club Ticketing: 

Trans-Siberian Orchestra will be selling an allotment of tickets for each show prior to our on sale. The TSO Fan Club will be offered these tickets in advance of the general public. Be sure to sign up for the TSO Fan Club so you can get an email with the information on when the pre sale starts. Tickets purchased through our website may be limited in certain cities. If there is a ticket limit it will be posted on the cities ticketing page. 

We try and keep the tickets to great seats. As more and more members order tickets, there is a strong probability that some members will be allocated seats to the sides of the stage, as well as in upper tier or upper bowl sections. Seat locations are determined by the best tickets available at the time of purchase. Refunds and exchanges are not permitted.
