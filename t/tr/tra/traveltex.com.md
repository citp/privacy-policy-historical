The following is the privacy policy for this site (all pages starting with www.TravelTex.com):

  1. Cookies are used only to allow the site to welcome you back to the site should you visit the site again and to set your chosen site parameters as they were on your last visit. We do not use cookies to collect any information other than just described. Note: A cookie file contains unique information a web site can use to track such things as passwords, lists of pages you've visited, and the date when you last looked at a specific page or to identify your session at a particular web site. We do not use cookies for any of these purposes.
  

  2. If you send us an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, or fill out a form that e-mails us this information, we will only use the personally-identifiable information to respond to your request and analyze trends. We may redirect your message to another government agency or person who is in a better position to answer your question.
  

  3. If you enter any contact information in the Travel Planner for use in travel planning, this information will only be sent to another source such as a travel agency where you specifically request your Travel Planner information to be sent.

 **HTTP header, "referer"** \- The referer specifies the page from which the client accessed the current page.

 **System date** \- The date and time of the user/cl request.

 **Full request** \- The exact request the user/client made.

 **Status** \- The status code the server returned to the user/client.

 **Content length** \- The content length, in bytes, of the document sent to the user/client.

 **Method** \- The request method used.

 **Universal Resource Identifier (URI)** \- The location of a resource on the server.

 **Query string of the URI** \- Anything after the question mark in a URI.

The site also determines the browser type and video resolution that you are using so as to best deliver the sites content for viewing and operation.
