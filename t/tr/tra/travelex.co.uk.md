We collect and process your information in the following ways:

**_Information you give us:_**

  * You give us information about yourself when you purchase or use Travelex Services, or communicate with us (whether in writing, by phone or by any other means), or enter into any of our competitions, promotions or surveys.

This is generally to provide you with the services that you request from us, to keep you informed and to improve your customer experience and the quality of the Travelex Services. In some instances we use this information to send you marketing communications we think are relevant to you, but we only do this where it is lawful to do so or you have given your consent to receiving this information.

Where data is anonymised, we ensure that it cannot be used (singularly or with other data) to re-identify you.
