## How personal information is collected

### Profile

A profile is a set of information for each individual User that details their viewing preferences. We do not use stored user settings for marketing purposes. User settings (chart settings, toolbars, buttons, etc.) are kept solely for the purpose of customizing User experience when using Website. We do not share your private profile settings with any third parties.   
When you create your profile on Website you agree that other users or visitors may access your public profile on our Website and see any information you've made available about yourself. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.   
For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. We use a session cookie to control access to our paid areas.   
A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser's help file directions. If you are a Paid User and you have checked the "Remember me" box on our logon page, we store your Username and Password in persistent cookies so that you do not need to re-enter that information each time you visit the Website.   
**You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of the Website nor will you be able to access the paid areas if cookies are disabled.**

### Log Files

Like most websites, we use web server log files. Records in our log files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISP's), referring pages, exit pages, platform types, and date/time stamps. We use web server log files to administer the site, to provide broad traffic information for site planning purposes, and to ensure that our terms of service agreement is being adhered to. IP addresses are not tied to personally identifiable information in our web server log files. 

### Web beacons (Clear GIFs)

Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that allow us to track usage patterns, count users who have visited a particular page, etc. Web beacons collect only limited information, including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. These beacons do not carry any personally identifiable information and are only used to track the effectiveness of Website. We use Web beacons in connection with Google Analytics service. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the website. Google will store this information. Please refer to Google's privacy policy to get more information. 

### Security

We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in order to protect certain information that you submit. This type of technology protects you from having your information intercepted by anyone, while it is being transmitted to TradingView or PayPal . While on a secure page, such as our order form, the "lock" icon in the browser window is displayed, confirming that a secure, encrypted connection has been established with the Website. We work hard to ensure that our Website is secure and that we meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards, such as firewalls, authentication systems (e.g., passwords and personal identification numbers), and access control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data.   
We also do our best to protect user information offline. All of our users' personal information is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need to see the information to perform their jobs are allowed to access it. The servers that store personally identifiable information are located in a secure environment in a locked facility. 

### Links to other sites

At our discretion we can add links (web links) to other sites (web sites) from our Website. These sites can be run by third parties with separate and independent privacy policies. We, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the content, activities or privacy policies of those linked sites. We suggest you read the privacy policy of each and every site that you visit. We remind you that this privacy policy applies only to information collected by our Website (TradingView.com). 

### Our hosted charting solutions

Some of our business partners use our charting solutions on their own websites. Such sites may display messages like "Powered by TradingView" or similar. Even if those messages are present, we do not control the privacy policies of those sites. We suggest you read the privacy policy of each and every site that you visit. 

### Public Profile

When you create your profile on Website, you agree that other users or visitors may access your public profile on our Website and see any information you've made available about yourself. When browsing the Website for trading ideas, they will only be able to view your: market information (Ideas published, Markets allocation, Top Mentioned Symbols), social information (followers and following lists), contact information (About section, location, Twitter, website), your community status (Moderator or PRO badges). Your email address won't be visible (until you will decide to make it visible). 

### Public Charts and Ideas

Our Website allows Registered Users to share their Charts with indicators and comments added (i.e. Ideas) with the rest of the Internet via our Publish Idea feature. Use of Publish Idea feature is considered to be voluntary disclosure of personal information by you.   
Paid Users can make their Ideas available only for particular persons they want and not for everybody (using "Publicly visible chart" checkbox). 

## How personal information is used

### Account Administration

We send all new Users a welcome activation email to verify their email address.   
Paid Users will also receive a notification email from PayPal if there are any issues with billing their cards for monthly auto-renew subscriptions.   
Users cannot opt-out of these messages, though they can deactivate their account. 

### Announcements and Newsletters

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out service-related announcements or important newsletters.
