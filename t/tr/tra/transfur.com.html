<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p>
    We will not sell, share, or rent information collected on this site to others in ways 
    different from what is disclosed in this statement. Transfur collects information from our 
    users at several different points on our website.
</p>
    
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>
    In order to use portions of this website, a user must first complete the registration
    form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such
    as user name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about
    the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional
    for the user to provide demographic information (such as gender).
</p>
    
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
    A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information
    about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable
    information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply
    terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have
    to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a
    user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this
    is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.
</p>
    
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p>
    We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement,
    and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not
    linked to personally identifiable information.
</p>
    
<h2>Links</h2>
<p>
    This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Transfur is not
    responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users
    to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each
    and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy
    statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
</p>
    
<h2>Surveys &amp; Contests</h2>
<p>
    From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.
    Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user
    therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information
    requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and
    demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will
    be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used
    for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
</p>
    
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
    This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users
    submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both
    online and off-line.
</p>
    
<h2>Site and Service Updates</h2>
<p>
    We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able
    to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information
    about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and
    in regards to issues relating to their account via email.
</p>

<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
<p>
    Transfur will not notify users directly about changes to our privacy policy. Users
    are responsible for checking this page for any policy changes.
