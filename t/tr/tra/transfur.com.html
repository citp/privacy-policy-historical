    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        Transfur is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not
        sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed
        in this statement. Transfur collects information from our users at several different
        points on our website.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Registration</h2>
    <p>
        In order to use portions of this website, a user must first complete the registration
        form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such
        as user name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about
        the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional
        for the user to provide demographic information (such as gender).
    </p>
    
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information
        about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable
        information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply
        terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have
        to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a
        user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this
        is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Log Files</h2>
    <p>
        We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement,
        and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not
        linked to personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>
        This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Transfur is not
        responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users
        to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each
        and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy
        statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Surveys &amp; Contests</h2>
    <p>
        From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.
        Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user
        therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information
        requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and
        demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will
        be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used
        for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users
        submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both
        online and off-line.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Site and Service Updates</h2>
    <p>
        We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able
        to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information
        about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and
        in regards to issues relating to their account via email.
    </p>

    <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
    <p>
        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage
        so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and
        under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Transfur will not notify users directly about changes to our privacy policy. Users
        are responsible for checking this page for any policy changes.
