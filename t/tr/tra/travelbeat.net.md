# TravelBeat.net — Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement is part of Experience Omnimedia's [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.travelbeat.net/termsofuse.html "TravelBeat.net Terms of Use Agreement") (the "Agreement") and informs you of our practices with respect to the online collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by this Website. Personal information is information that allows us to contact you (such as email address, home address, or telephone number) or other information that, when linked to your name or contact information, allows us to personalize your visit to the Website by providing you with information that suits your interests.

We are the owner of this Website and retain all ownership rights to the information collected at this site. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Statement. Any changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted here and delivered to an email address provided by you.

This site may make available chat rooms, blogs, forums, message boards, and news groups. Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in any chat room, blog, forum, message board, or news group.

We collect personal information from you on the Website when you voluntarily submit it to us. We may request specific personal information, such as your name and email address as well as demographic information, such as your Zip code, when you register a screen name at the Website. You may also be provided the opportunity to provide us with your postal address in order to receive offline publications and/or promotions from us.

We may use certain non-personally-identifiable information from your web browser, such as your computer's IP address, to administer the Website, to help diagnose problems with our server, to analyze trends, to track users' webpage movements, to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This Website may also use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. We may let other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Disabling cookies may result in receiving less than the full benefit from the use of this Website.

Like you, we do not like to receive unsolicited emails, or "spam." Except as otherwise provided in the "Disclosure of Personal Information" section, below, we will not sell, rent or share your email address with anyone. We may, however, share your postal address with our trusted partners so that they may provide you with information or offers that may be of interest to you.

If you subscribe to one or more of our newsletters, we will use your email address to deliver the newsletters to you. We may also use your email address to send you information about us and our services or to send you promotional material on behalf of our advertisers and partners.

We may use other information that you provide to us to show you content in which you may be interested and to display the content according to your preferences.

Online Surveys. From time to time, we may conduct online surveys. These ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like Zip code or age). We may use the information that you provide us to provide you with additional information about our company and promotional material on behalf of some of our partners.

Supplemental Information. To enhance our ability to tailor this site to your preferences, we may combine information that you provide us on registration and other online sign-up forms with other information about you that we may obtain through your use of our service.

Shopping/Commercial Services. This Website may offer shopping services, which may be offered by us or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our site offers shopping or other commercial services, you will use a customer order form to request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us contact information (like name or email address), financial information (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like Zip code or age).

We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products and services. By submitting your credit card and related personal information to the Website, you are authorizing us to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.

We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. We may also use contact data to get in touch with you. We will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval.

Disclosure of Personal Information. We may disclose or transfer your personal information, including contact information such as your email address, in the following circumstances:

  * To enforce our [Terms of Use Agreement](http://www.travelbeat.net/termsofuse.html "Terms of Use Agreement");
  * To protect our rights and property as well as those of our affiliates;
  * When we reasonably believe that it is justifiable in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or harmful activities, suspected fraud, or threats to the safety, security, and/or welfare of users, employees, third-parties, and property;
  * With our agents, advisors, and partners, consistent with the foregoing;
  * As compelled or authorized by applicable law or in connection with legal or regulatory proceedings;
  * To a new and/or successor entity, in the event that we and/or our corporate subsidiaries, are acquired by, transferred to, or merged with another company, in whole or in part; and
