Once a client has signed up with Verbumsoft, future mailing may periodically be sent out to the Verbumsoft client base, introducing new products, product updates, and important Verbumsoft news and information. Our users and clients have the option of receiving the Verbumsoft company newsletter. Should a client choose to receive the newsletter via e-mail, we will not distribute the user e-mail address for any other purpose than the sending of our newsletter or other Verbumsoft service information. If a user would like to cease receiving the newsletter or other promotional e-mail correspondence from Verbumsoft, they may send an e-mail request to [service@verbumsoft.com](mailto:service@verbumsoft.com) and immediately be removed from future mailings. Verbumsoft requires a valid, working e-mail address upon account setup in order to send our client account information details, including a welcome packet, and account username and password.

This third-party is used only to process credit card charges, and does not store or distribute customer credit card or billing information.
