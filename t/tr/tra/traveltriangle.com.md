  1. **Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**  
We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name,phone number, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with TravelTriangle.com. While you can browse some sections of our site without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do require registration. We do use your contact information to send you offers based on your previous orders and your interests. 
  2. **Use of Demographic and Profile Data**  
We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal information to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses.

We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in--and to display content according to your preferences.
