This Privacy Policy also explains how We use and maintain that information.

Three types of data and information are collected by Us or shared with Us:

**Non-personal Information:**  
Which is non-identifying and non-identifiable information, without particular reference to the identity of the user from which such information was collected: When you visit our Website, information about your visit (e.g. how you navigate the site) may be collected and stored. This information may include the length of your visit, the date and time of your visit, the pages you look at and the sites you visit before and after leaving our site. It does not include personally-identifiable information such as your name, mailing or email address or telephone number.

We also may share this general non-identifiable information with our affiliates, suppliers, sponsors and advertisers.

**Personally-Identifiable Information:** Which is individually identifiable information that identifies an individual, or may with reasonable effort identify an individual, either alone or in combination with other information, or may be of private or sensitive nature.

As part of this voluntary registration, we may request contact information (such as name, mailing address, email address, etc.) and other data required for operating these services. We may only collect personal information from you if you voluntarily provide it. By voluntarily providing this personal information to us, by sending us a comment or suggestion, you will be consenting to the collection, use and distribution of your personal information by us for the purposes set out herein. You are under no obligation to provide us with personal information and may access and enjoy many parts of our website without providing us any personal information.

**"Cookie”:** We keep track of the pages visited by our users by placing a small entry-in text file, called a "cookie", on your hard drive. A cookie is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. Cookies do not reveal personal information. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself such as email address, purchases and preferences. Cookies cannot read data from your hard drive.

The Site may contain electronic images known as “web beacons” which are also sometimes called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering cookies, allow us to count visitors to the Site pages and to deliver services via the Site.

### Use and sharing of information

For the purposes of IT hosting and maintenance all the personal data we process is located on servers within the USA. No 3rd parties have access to your personal data unless the law allows them to do so. We have a Data Protection regime in place to oversee the effective and secure processing of your personal data. Your information that you provide us with will be kept with us until you notify us that you no longer wish to participate/benefit from Service. You can easily opt-out by emailing to us via [info@traffichunt.com](mailto:info@traffichunt.com).

In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information will likely be among the assets transferred. We also reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
