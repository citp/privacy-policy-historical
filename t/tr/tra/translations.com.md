**Notice**  – TransPerfect treats all material sent to us from our clients, vendors, and employees (collectively, "CVEs") as confidential in accordance with its current confidentiality undertakings with CVEs.  Confidentiality provisions are required as part of all of our contracts with all of our clients vendors and employees; each separate entity must sign a confidentiality agreement prior to becoming affiliated or working with TransPerfect.  

All emails sent to TransPerfect (globally) are routed through a third party SPAM filter (AppRiver) which is located in the United States. This means all email correspondence originated outside of the United States with an end destination other than the United States still must travel through the United States before arrival at the desired location.

TransPerfect utilizes a network of over 4,000 freelance vendors to assist in the process of translation. They may receive, as part of the assignment, the name of the client they are working on but no Personal Data about that client, unless such contact information is needed to perform the assignment (such as the cases of onsite interpretation projects, onsite document review, etc.). These freelance vendors may also have access to any Personal Data within the source documents and reference material sent to them for translation. However, in all cases, the freelance vendors will be subject to confidentiality undertakings in which such freelance vendors undertake to keep such information confidential and only use such information in accordance with their projects.

All vendors who will be processing Personal Data of EU citizens or residents are required to sign the EU Data Protection Agreement and EU Standard Contractual Clauses. These documents address common requirements concerning Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Access, Security, Data Integrity and Enforcement of the Personal Data with respect to the Personal Data.  Any EU vendor has the right to terminate its working relationship with TransPerfect and request the deletion of Personal Data pertaining to them. However, as permitted by applicable law, TransPerfect will continue to maintain its historical business records in such a way so that TransPerfect may retain its historical knowledge and relationships concerning any legal or regulatory inquiries which may later arise. This practice is in the best interests of both parties so that identifying information relating to a particular matter is accessible but sufficiently discrete so that TransPerfect does not accidentally contact them for projects in the future.

**Choice**  – TransPerfect's clients have the choice concerning what Personal Data is accessed, used or retained. In order to conduct business with our clients it is necessary to maintain contact information and specific billing information, but the extent of the information stored can always be discussed with a TransPerfect Client Services Representative. Additionally, if there is a specific concern about the Personal Data found in the information provided to process a language services project (such as source, reference material, etc.), we recommend redacting this information prior to sending it to TransPerfect or discussing alternative solutions with your TransPerfect Client Services Representative. In addition, other steps may be taken which may include the forced anonymization of information and limitation of translation efforts to de-identified data only.

In order to better serve our client's needs and provide further information concerning services, TransPerfect may, from time-to-time, send information on additional services we provide. Should any client decide that this information is not desirable, a client may opt-out of receiving this information by informing their Client Services Representative or by contacting the TransPerfect Privacy Officer.   
TransPerfect employees have a choice concerning what information is shared with other employees, affiliates and third parties (such as clients). Such information will only be provided pursuant to such employees written consent and not used for any other purpose.

**Access and Correction  **– Any individual CVE may request a copy of the Personal Data TransPerfect has collected from TransPerfect's Privacy Officer in accordance with applicable law, in addition to receiving confirmation of the contents of any Personal Data relating to the individual. Under applicable law, such individual CVE then has the right to correct, amend or delete information when it is inaccurate.

Clients may do so by contacting their Client Services Representative or by contacting the TransPerfect Privacy Officer.  
Except as may be required by law or during a registrar or regulatory audit, TransPerfect will not provide this data to a third party without the consent of the CVE.

Vendors can do so by contacting [EDPA@transperfect.com](mailto:EDPA@transperfect.com), a dedicated e-mail address to which such inquiries can be sent directly.

Employees can do so by contacting the TransPerfect Human Resources department or the TransPerfect Privacy Officer.

**Data Integrity  **– TransPerfect is dedicated to ensuring that all data maintained is accurate, updated, and relevant for the use contemplated by the CVE and will take all required steps to ensure the data is accurate, complete and current. This process is accomplished by regular email and written correspondence with CVEs; however, it is highly recommended that CVEs continue to monitor the information provided to TransPerfect and remain proactive with requesting access to any Personal Data and advising TransPerfect of the need for corrections as needed.

**Data Security**  – TransPerfect has strict physical and logical security procedures to ensure that all digital and paper records are secured (such policy is available for dissemination to clients upon written request to the TransPerfect Privacy Officer). These records are accessible only by approved staff. All critical systems (e.g., servers) are accessible only by a small number of authorized staff. TransPerfect's information security is managed internally and is routinely audited to ensure conformity with TransPerfect procedures and recommended industry standards.

TransPerfect undertakes to verify compliance with its Privacy Policy not less than once per year and in connection with TransPerfect's annual review and internal compliance measures. TransPerfect will use its best commercial efforts to ensure that compliance with this Privacy Policy is maintained and that the Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, and continues to conform to applicable law. We encourage CVEs to raise and discuss any issues or concerns with TransPerfect's Privacy Officer directly who address and resolve such complaints regarding the use of data and noncompliance with our Privacy Policy. All issues will be officially documented within the framework of our ISO 9001 certified quality management system.

TransPerfect is committed to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) as well as FDPIC, and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and/or Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.

TransPerfect provides information regarding the below through policies and trainings:

  * TransPerfect is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)
  * The possibility, under certain conditions, for the individual to invoke binding arbitration
  * The requirement for your organization to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements
  * TransPerfect's liability in cases of onward transfers to third parties



With respect to complaints related to our Privacy Policy that cannot be resolved through our internal process, we agree to abide by the dispute resolution procedures established by the Privacy Shield frameworks.
