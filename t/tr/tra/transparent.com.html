<h1>Transparent Language, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We also adhere to the principles of purpose limitation and data minimization. Therefore, we only store your personal data for as long as it is necessary to achieve the purposes mentioned here or as long as the storage periods required by law. After discontinuation of the respective purpose or expiry of these deadlines, the corresponding data will be blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions. Our legal basis for the deletion or blocking of personal data is Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) c) GDPR.</p>

<h3>Information Control</h3>
<p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), and to request the deletion or restriction of your information. Transparent will respond to requests about these matters within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessing and updating your information:</strong> Should you wish to access or update any of your information, you can contact us through any of the forms on the site, or by email at info@transparent.com. Likewise, you have the right to contact us and request an electronic file with a copy of your information.</li>
<li><strong>Opting out of communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, by updating your email preferences within the Site, or by contacting Transparent at info@transparent.com.</li>
<li><strong>Accepting or declining cookies:</strong> Cookies are small files which can be placed on your computer's hard drive to allow websites to respond to you as an individual. With cookies, web Sites can tailor their operations to your needs, likes, and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Within the Site, we use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes, then remove the data from our system. The cookies in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. Please be aware that if you choose to decline cookies, some or all of the Site may be inaccessible or non-functional.</li>
<li><strong>Requesting that we forget you:</strong> If you no longer want Transparent to continue storing information about you, you may contact us and request that your account be forgotten. When we receive such a request, we will retain your data for 30 days. If you change your mind during this period, you can contact us again to stop the process of being forgotten. If you have not contacted us within 30 days, your account will be permanently forgotten.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
<p>Transparent will not sell, distribute, or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so. However, we may use the following sales and marketing products for web analytics and social media marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. ("Google"), on the Site. Google Analytics uses its own cookies to evaluate site usage, compile site activity reports, and provide other services related to website activity and internet usage on behalf of Transparent. Google is a U.S. company that uses servers in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>Google AdWords:</strong> If you reach the Site via an advertisement sent by Google, Google AdWords sets a cookie on your computer. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages on the Site and the cookie has not expired, we and Google may recognize that you clicked on the ad and were redirected to this page. Google is a U.S. company that uses servers in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>HubSpot:</strong> HubSpot tracks, documents, and manages many interactions on the Site to help us assess the effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategy. HubSpot programs access data collected on the Site from services such as Google AdWords and compile reports that provide information about the demand for our products and our clientele. HubSpot also uses cookies to track Site visitors in real time and recognize potential customers among them. Finally, HubSpot email tracking provides a notification when a customer opens an email sent by us and clicks on the link to our offers. We can then respond to the customer with a personal email or an automated answer. HubSpot is a U.S. company that uses servers in the United States, and has signed a data processing agreement with us to keep our data safe.</li>
<li><strong>HubSpot LiveChat:</strong> HubSpot LiveChat is built into the Site to let our users communicate with Transparent employees. HubSpot LiveChat collects access data such as IP address, browser, and operating system type as well as the dial-in location from users of the live chat. In addition, cookies are used to collect further data about user behavior. HubSpot has represented to us that it processes this information solely to improve its own services. HubSpot stores and processes all collected data on servers located in the United States.</li>
<li><strong>SurveyMonkey:</strong> SurveyMonkey lets Transparent create surveys that users of the Site may choose to participate in. We use these surveys to collect user opinions and feedback that helps us improve the Site and our products. Surveys are anonymous but may allow users to submit questions along with their email address. SurveyMonkey attempts to distinguish users by using their IP addresses as identifiers. SurveyMonkey is a U.S. company.</li>
<li><strong>TypeForm:</strong> We uses TypeForm to create data input forms that allow users to submit technical support cases and other customer service requests. TypeForm is a Barcelona-based online Software as a Service (SaaS) company that specializes in online form building and online surveys.</li>
<li><strong>GrooveHQ:</strong> We use GrooveHQ for technical support case management, knowledge base, and LiveChat. GrooveHQ is a U.S. company.</li>
<li><strong>CloudAMQP:</strong> We use CloudAMQP to host an instance of RabbitMQ, which is used to send data to Transparent servers for processing. Information is not stored by CloudAMQP and is encrypted in transit.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS):</strong> We use AWS to host content, send emails and notifications, maintain access logs, and provide support within Transparent authoring tools. AWS encrypts data at rest and uses secret keys to control who can access various data points.</li>
<li><strong>HotJar:</strong> HotJar allows Transparent to gather anonymous data about how users interact with the Site. Over time, we analyze that data to improve the Site's usability and determine the most used features. From a single visitor session, HotJar may create a heatmap; visually recreate the session by replaying mouse movements, page scrolls, and click coordinates; evaluate the user's progress through various steps; and note which fields of a form a user filled out before abandoning it. Visual recreations of sessions will not include sensitive or personal information entered by the user. HotJar attempts to distinguish users by using their IP addresses as identifiers. HotJar also uses cookies to distinguish new users from returning ones to avoid redundant behaviors. HotJar is a U.S. company.</li>
<li><strong>BlueSnap:</strong> BlueSnap processes Transparent's payment transactions. Transparent also uses a cart hosted by BlueSnap servers to gather customer payment info at purchase time, which means Transparent never has access to that info. After a transaction has taken place between BlueSnap and a Transparent customer, Transparent may view transaction information such as date, customer email, customer name, customer address, amount, payment method, and product purchased, but not payment info. BlueSnap is a U.S. company.</li>
<li><strong>FeedBlitz:</strong> We use FeedBlitz to send emails to voluntary subscribers to our blogs and Word of the Day service. FeedBlitz is a U.S. company.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress:</strong> We use WordPress to power our blogs. WordPress may collect the name, email address, and IP address of users who voluntarily choose to comment on our blog articles. WordPress is a U.S. company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our legal basis for the use of these third-party products is provisions 6 (1) b) and 6 (1) f) of GDPR.</p>
