<p>
As a user of Travelocity's web sites, mobile applications and services (collectively, the "Travelocity Service"), you are in control of your travel-planning. We know you want to remain in control of your personal information as well. As one of the pioneers in online travel, we realize that earning and retaining your trust is of paramount importance and it's a responsibility we take very seriously, every day.
</p>
<p>
That's why we've provided this Privacy Policy, which sets forth Travelocity's policies regarding the collection, use and protection of the personal information of those using Travelocity Service. Personal information means information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card number.  
</p>
<p>
We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy, and become familiar with it, but you should know that <strong>we do not sell or rent our customers' personal information to third parties.</strong>.
</p> 
<p>
Please note that we review our Privacy Policy from time to time, and we may make periodic changes to the policy in connection with that review. Therefore, you may wish to bookmark this page and/or periodically review this page to make sure that you have the current version. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains the following:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="#info">What personal information we collect from you and how we use it</a> 
</li><li><a href="#share">With whom (if anyone) your personal information is shared</a>
</li><li><a href="#optout">How you can opt-out of receiving our promotional e-mails</a>

<p></p>

<p>	
<a name="info"></a><span style="font-weight:bold">What personal information does Travelocity gather from me and how is this information used?</span><br>
</p><p>
You are not required to provide any personal information to us unless and until you choose to make a purchase or sign up for one of our e-mail newsletters or other services as described below. We do not knowingly permit the Travelocity Service to be used by any person under the age of eighteen and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children (meaning those younger than thirteen years of age). A valid credit or debit card is required to make a purchase using the Travelocity Service
</p>

<p><i>Making a Purchase</i><br>
In order to purchase travel and related services using the Travelocity Service, you must provide us with certain personal information such as your name, your credit card number and expiration date, your credit card billing address, your telephone number, your e-mail address and the name or names of the person(s) traveling (if not you). We may also ask you for other personal information, such as your frequent traveler numbers. We require this information so that we can process, fulfill and confirm your reservations and transactions and keep you informed of each transaction's status. If you are making a reservation for one or more travelers other than yourself, you will need to make sure that each of these other travelers agrees, in advance, that you may disclose their personal information to us. For your convenience, we make certain information about your reservation available to you or other persons authorized by you to receive such information. For example, if you forgot your flight number, you or another person authorized by you may retrieve that information from us after providing information sufficient in our view to confirm your identity or that such other person is authorized by you to receive that information. 
</p>  

<p><i>Express Consent To Receive Pre-Recorded And Text Messages</i><br>
When you make a booking using the Travelocity Service, we request that you provide us with a contact telephone number. We will use your telephone number in the event that we need to inform you of changes or other matters that may affect your booking or trip, such as changes due to flight delays, inclement weather, and cancellations. We may use an automatic telephone dialing system, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, or text messages to provide you with such updates. When you provide us with a cellular, wireless, or mobile telephone number as the contact number for a trip, you agree that you are providing us with your express consent to receive prerecorded voice messages or text messages from Travelocity or our third party suppliers and content providers ("Third Party Suppliers") related to your booking. If you do not wish to receive these trip updates on your mobile phone, please provide us with another telephone number.</p>


<p><i>Member Registration</i><br>
If you choose to register as a member of Travelocity, you must provide your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, a unique login name, password, and password validation, and a password hint to help you remember your password. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including: (i) personal identification; (ii) to complete air, hotel, car, and other reservations; (iii) to allow us to contact you for customer service purposes, if necessary; (iv) to customize the content of the Travelocity Service to meet your specific needs; and (v) to make product improvements to the Travelocity Service. In addition, we need your e-mail address to confirm your new member registration and each reservation you transact using the Travelocity Service. As a Travelocity member you will also occasionally receive updates from us about fare sales in your area, special offers, new Travelocity services, and other noteworthy items. However, you may choose at any time to no longer receive these types of e-mail messages. Please see our Opt-Out policy described below for details.
</p>
<p><i>Member Profile</i><br>
As a Travelocity member, you can choose to complete your online profile by providing us with travel preferences, frequent-traveler or affinity numbers, credit-card billing information, paper ticket delivery address, and other personal information. This information is primarily used to assist you in making reservations quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly. For example, you can store your airline frequent-flyer numbers so that when your make a reservation on that airline using the Travelocity Service, we can automatically pre-fill the frequent-flyer number input box for you. 
</p>

<p><i>TSA Secure Flight</i><br>
Under the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure Flight program, most air passengers are now required to provide their full name, date of birth, and gender (plus redress number, when applicable). We will not permanently store this personal information for any travelers, aside from the required entries in the air reservation record. We will not disclose this information to any third parties other than the applicable airline(s). If you are making a reservation for travelers other than yourself, you should make sure each traveler agrees, in advance, that you may disclose their personal information to us.</p>

<p>Secure Flight is a federally mandated program set forth in the <em>Secure Flight Final Rule</em>, published in the <em>Federal Register</em> Volume 73, Number 209.  The TSA privacy notice can be found in Section 1560.103 of the <em>Secure Flight Final Rule</em>:</p>

<blockquote>The Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires aircraft operators to collect information from you for purposes of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Providing this information is voluntary; however, if it is not provided, you may be subject to additional screening or denied transport or authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA Privacy policies, or to view the system of records notice and the privacy impact assessment, please see TSA's Web site at <a href="http://www.tsa.gov">www.tsa.gov</a>.</blockquote>


<p><i>Newsletters and FareWatcher Plus<span class="smark">SM</span></i><br>
Travelocity's Real Deals and other newsletters and our FareWatcher Plus<span class="smark">SM</span> service are optional benefits you may choose to subscribe to that keep you up to date with the latest special travel deals and low airfares. FareWatcher Plus<span class="smark">SM</span> tracks the prices of airline tickets to your favorite places. When the price for one of your favorite trips changes based on your preferences, Travelocity will notify you of the change via e-mail. Your e-mail address and preferred round trip city pairs are necessary to receive FareWatcher Plus<span class="smark">SM</span> e-mails.
</p>  

<p><i>Online Surveys</i><br>
Travelocity values opinions and comments from members, so we frequently conduct online surveys. Participation in these surveys is optional. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to the Travelocity Service and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for customers. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.</p>

<p><i>Promotions &amp; Sweepstakes</i><br>
Travelocity frequently sponsors promotions and sweepstakes to give customers the opportunity to win great travel and travel-related prizes. Information collected by us for such activities can include contact information and survey questions. We use contact information to notify contest winners and survey information to develop promotions and product improvements to the Travelocity Service. 
</p>
<p><i>Third Parties Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</i><br>
Travelocity may share your personal information with third parties when you engage in certain activities on our site that are sponsored by third parties, such as electing to receive information or communications from a third party (such as a hotel company or a tourism board for a particular destination), or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party. Travelocity may also share your personal information when you respond to promotional materials from Travelocity and authorize a third party to use your personal information for purposes such as, for example, sending you additional promotional materials, providing you a product or service, or entering you in a contest, sweepstakes or game. We refer to all of these activities and requests as "Sponsored Activities." When you participate in Sponsored Activities, you will either be required or requested to agree that Travelocity may send your personal information (such as, in some cases, your mailing address or e-mail address) to the sponsor, and the sponsor may use your personal information in accordance with the sponsor's privacy practices. <em>In each case described in this section, Travelocity will only share your personal information after receiving your consent</em>. You should know that when Travelocity shares your personal information with a third party under any circumstance described in this section, your personal information will become permanently subject to the privacy policy of the third party, and the third party will not be restricted by Travelocity's Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information. 
</p>

<p><i>Automatic Logging of Session Data</i><br>
We automatically log generic information about your computer and your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call "session data". Session data consists of things such as device information, IP address, operating system and browser software information, and the activities conducted by the user while using the Travelocity Service. An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our systems. It is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. We may also use some session data, such as the pages you visited on our site, to send you e-mail messages (such as "Good Day to Buy") focused on destinations that you may be interested in, unless you had previously opted out of receiving such messages. We also use session data to help prevent fraud or unauthorized use of our site. 
</p>

Similarly, cookies may be placed by our third-party advertising companies. These companies may use aggregated statistics about your use of the Travelocity Service and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about travel-related goods and services that you may be interested in. The information they collect does not include your personal information.</p>

<p>The third-party advertising companies may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of ads. Any such information is anonymous.

<p><i>Submitted Content</i><br>
You can contribute to the Travelocity Service in a number of different ways, including by providing journals, recommendations, reviews, opinions, news articles, directories, guides, text, photographs, illustrations, graphics, logos, audio clips, images, information, data, photographs, software, messages, ideas, comments, questions, or other materials for public display on the Travelocity Service (your "Submitted Content"). Note that if you include personally identifiable information in your Submitted Content, it can be used and viewed by others. We are not responsible for the information you choose to include in your Submitted Content.</p>

<p><i>Third Party Services </i><br> 
We may allow you to access third party services, such as Facebook and Twitter, that enable you to share your selected Submitted Content with those services, and import information about who you are connected with on those other services so you can connect with them using the Travelocity Service. Where we provide such functionality, such as on IgoUgo.com, you can always opt out on your IgoUgo account page. Some of those third party services may also provide us with information from your accounts there to enhance and personalize your use of the Travelocity Service. For example, you can allow Facebook to tell us who your Facebook friends are so you can follow their activity on the Travelocity Service  (including on IgoUgo.com). You can, at any time, adjust your IgoUgo settings to remove this feature, by changing your Facebook preferences on the site. You can also further modify your privacy settings with those other services directly. For example, you can adjust your privacy settings on Facebook to prevent your Facebook friends from sharing information about you from their Facebook accounts with us.</p>


<p><i>Other</i><br>
From time to time we may add or enhance services available using the Travelocity Service. To the extent these services are provided and used by you, we will use the information you provide to facilitate the service requested. For example, if you email us with a question, we will use information such as your email address, name and the nature of the question, to respond to your question. We may also store such information to assist us in making the Travelocity Service better and easier to use.</p>
<br>

<p>
<a name="share"></a><span style="font-weight:bold">With whom (if anyone) will my personal information be shared?</span><br>

</p><p>
When you reserve or purchase travel services using the Travelocity Service, we provide to the airline, hotel, car-rental agency, travel agency or other involved Third Party Supplier only that portion of your personal information that is needed for the successful fulfillment of your travel arrangements. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of all such Third Party Suppliers as their policies may be materially different from this Privacy Policy. We may also share personal information among our corporate affiliates at Sabre Holdings Corporation. For example, we book most of our travel services through the Sabre Global Distribution System, a leading processor of travel bookings worldwide which is operated by an affiliated company, and in doing so must provide certain of your personal information to them (as we would with any other GDS we now use or may use in the future). The Sabre privacy policy is available at <a href="http://sabre-holdings.com/privacy/coreData.html">http://sabre-holdings.com/privacy/coreData.html</a>. We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of our site. We may provide anonymous statistical information based on this data to suppliers, advertisers, affiliates and other current and potential business partners. We may also use such aggregate data to inform these third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their web sites. Occasionally, Travelocity will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and contest-entry processing, or will contract with a third party to provide co-branded products, such as a Travelocity credit card. In such cases, Travelocity will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information we provide to such third parties is protected by a confidentiality agreement and is to be used solely for the purpose(s) for which it has been provided.  See "<a href="#moreinfo">What other information should I know about my privacy?</a>" below.

In addition, if Travelocity or substantially all of its assets are acquired, the personal information of our customers will most likely also be transferred in connection with such acquisition.
