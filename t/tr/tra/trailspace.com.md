# Privacy Policy - Trailspace.com

Individuals who visit the Trailspace website are important to us. Because visitors to our website are important, we do not capture personal information about them without their permission. We endeavor to collect only the minimum amount of information needed to meet the purposes for which the website was created.

## Log Files

Like most websites we maintain log files. The information collected in our log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp.

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web services and help us understand how people are using our services. We analyze our website logs to continually improve the value of the materials available on our site. The information in our website logs is not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link it with the individuals that browse our website.

## Personally Identifiable Information

"Personally identifiable information" is information about a person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. It includes, for example, an individual's name, street address, email address, or phone number.

Personally identifiable information will not be collected unless you voluntarily provide it. For example, by sending an email message, including such information in an online form (such as a gear review, forum message, or member profile), or signing in using a social media account. Your choice not to participate in these activities will not impair your ability to access the information on this website.

## Message Boards, Public Forums, and Gear Reviews

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or by signing in with a social media account - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

## Cookies

Trailspace may use cookies on a limited basis in order to track your visit to our website or for other purposes. Trailspace does not use cookies to track or store personally identifiable information.

Some of our business partners (for example, advertisers) may also use cookies on our site. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Trailspace only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

## Third Party Advertising

The graphical and text-based ads appearing on this website are delivered to users by several Web advertising partners. Information about users' visits to this site, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site.
