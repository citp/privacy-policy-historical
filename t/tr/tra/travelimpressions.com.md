Travel Impressions assists you in finding travel suppliers and making arrangements that meet your individual needs. We consider various factors in identifying travel suppliers to you and recommending specific itineraries. In this role, we are acting as an independent third party and not as a fiduciary. We want you to be aware that certain suppliers pay us commissions as well as incentives for reaching sales targets or other goals, and from time to time may also provide incentives to our travel counselors. Certain suppliers may also provide compensation to us for various marketing and administrative services that we perform for them, such as granting them access to our marketing channels, participating in marketing programs and supporting technology initiatives. In addition, our parent company, American Express, receives compensation from suppliers when customers use the American Express® Card or other American Express products to pay for supplier products and services. From time to time we may enter into other business relationships with suppliers and these arrangements, including levels and types of compensation and incentives we receive, are subject to change. In identifying suppliers and recommending itineraries, we may consider a number of factors, including supplier availability and your preferences. The relationships we have with suppliers may also influence the suppliers we identify and the itineraries we recommend.
