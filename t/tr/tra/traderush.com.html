on choosing the correct direction of an asset's price, from the given 
strike price, by the selected expiry period.  Once a trade is initiated,
 traders receive a confirmation screen showing the asset, strike price, 
the chosen direction (CALL or PUT), and the investment amount.  When 
prompted by this screen, trades will initiate in 3 seconds unless the 
Trader presses the cancel button. <a target="" href="http://www.traderush.com/AboutUs"> TradeRush.com</a> offers the fastest 
option expires available to the public and transactions can be as fast 
as `15 minutes in regular binary options, and as fast as 60 seconds in 
the 60 second platform.  Although the risk when trading binary options 
is fixed for each individual trade, the trades are live and it is 
possible to lose an initial investment, particularly if a trader chooses
 to place his entire investment to a single live trade.  It is highly 
recommended that traders choose a proper money management strategy which
 limits the total consecutive trades or total outstanding investment.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="color: rgb(97, 100, 105); font-family: Arial; font-size: 11px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: justify;"><font size="1"><br></font></p><p style="color: rgb(97, 100, 105); font-family: Arial; font-size: 11px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: justify;"><font size="1">**<b>It is recommended to use Google Chrome web browser when trading on TradeRush.com. </b><br></font></p></div>
