<h5>Last Updated on May 15, 2005</h5>

<h5>TravelPost.com does not send spam or sell email addresses.</h5>

<p><a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.travelpost.com&amp;sealid=101"><img src="images/clickseal.gif" width="91" height="73"></a></p>

<p>TravelPost.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to
build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site http://www.travelpost.com. Because
this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact
us at the following email address: "help [at] travelpost {dot} com". If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry
has not been satisfactorily address, you should contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php. 
TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.</p>

<h5>Privacy Policy</h5>

<p>We at TravelPost.com ("TravelPost", "we," or "us") recognize that your privacy is important to you.  We have created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain our privacy practices so you will understand when and how personally identifiable information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our web site located at <a href="home.aspx">www.travelpost.com</a> (the "Site"). BY ACCESSING OUR SITE, YOU CONSENT TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.</p>
<h5>No Spam Policy</h5>
<p>We at TravelPost are opposed to spam. Our No Spam Policy and Terms of Service prohibit all users from engaging in any activity involving spam on our service. Violations of these policies may result in immediate termination of service and legal action against any spammer. TravelPost's <a href="tos.aspx">Terms of Service</a> expressly prohibit users from uploading, posting, emailing, transmitting or otherwise making available junk mail, commercial advertisements, or other form of commercial solicitation on the TravelPost website or through TravelPost's services.</p>
<p>Any violation of our policies, by sending unsolicited email advertisements to or through TravelPost.com computer systems, will use or cause to be used TravelPost servers, located in California. Accordingly, any unauthorized use of TravelPost computer systems is a violation of our policies and certain federal and state laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. §1030 et seq.), Section 502 of the California Penal Code and Section 17538.45 of the California Business and Professions Code. Such violations may subject the sender and his or her agents to civil and criminal penalties.</p>
<h5>Changes to Privacy Policy</h5>
<p>From time to time, we may need to update our Privacy Policy because of changes in the law, in technology, in our business, or in our attempts to better serve your needs.  If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post a notification on our Site and update the effective date above. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site.  Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our privacy policy whenever you visit this Site to see if it has been updated since your last visit.</p>
<h5>Use By Children Under 13 Years of Age Prohibited</h5>
<p>TravelPost is intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons under 13 years of age are prohibited from registering on TravelPost.</p>
<h5>What Information Does TravelPost Gather?</h5>
<p>We collect two basic types of information from our Site.  Personally identifiable information is information that is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a user's name,e-mail address, or information about activities that is directly linked to that person.  </p>
<p>Our definition of personally identifiable information does not include "aggregate" information.  Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or user from which individual user identities have been removed.  Aggregate data may include anonymous demographic information such as country of origin, citizenship, ZIP code, age, gender, preferences and survey information.  In other words, how you use our Site may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Site, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data.  Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our user's needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site.</p>
<p>The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to us is completely at your discretion.  Some areas of our Site are accessible without registration of any kind, and you can browse those areas of our Site.  Other areas of our Site require registration in order for you to participate in the services offered.  It is not mandatory for you to register and provide information to us, but please realize that in order for us to serve you better or provide particular features, you will need to provide certain information to access some areas of our Site.</p>
<p>We collect information you give us when you register at and use our Site.  Examples include the following:</p>
<h5>Registration Information</h5> <p>When you register at our Site, we may collect various kinds of contact information about you including your name, e-mail address, date of birth, and other personally identifiable information.  </p>
<h5>TravelPost Postings and Product and Service Reviews</h5> <p>Please note that information that you post on our Site by using our TravelPost services may viewed by the general public, and may also be stored on our systems for a period of time or indefinitely.  You should not post any personally identifiable information that you do not wish to make publicly available.</p>
<h5>Submissions and Customer Service</h5> <p>From time-to-time we may post surveys, contests or sweepstakes on our site, which may request personally identifiable information, demographic information and customer feedback.  Contests may require contact information or other demographic or personally identifiable information in order to determine eligibility. We may use information collected from surveys and contests to notify and contact winners of those contests. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to participate and disclose information.  Also, we may collect information that identifies you personally when you send us comments, questions or suggestions.</p>

<h5>Cookies and Passive Data Collection</h5>  
<p>We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us.  For example, when you visit the Site, our systems automatically collect standard user information and clickstream data for all users, including a user's IP address, operating system, and page views.  Information may be automatically collected through the use of "cookies" which are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p>Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive by a web site when you visit. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about your visit so that when you return to the site, the site knows who you are and can personalize your visit.  In general, we may use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how to improve our site by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to personalize the site and improve the site experience. Cookies are not tied to your personally identifiable information. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting.  You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. If you decide not to accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our site available to the general public but you may not be able to use some of the site's features or services and you may have a less satisfactory experience.</p>
<p>We and the companies that serve advertisements on our Site use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps inform us and them about what content is active. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web user. Clear gifs are not tied to your personally identifiable information. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and very small, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the website would read the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. The information would then go back to the advertising company.  In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails, to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to know how well customers respond to certain communications.</p>

<h5>Third Party Links and Ad Servers</h5>
<p>We provide links to third party websites, which may, or may not, use cookies, pixel tags and web tags. We also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers, to display advertisements on TravelPost. Ad servers may also use these tools to compile information about where users saw particular advertisements, and to determine which ads were clicked on. We are not responsible for, or have any control over, the privacy policies of those third party websites and ad servers, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when linking directly from TravelPost.</p>



<h5>How Does TravelPost Use The User Information?</h5>
<h5>Internal Use of Personal Information</h5>
<p>In general, we use personal information internally to serve our users and enable them to take maximum advantage of our services.  For example, we may use personal information to contact our users relating to their registration to our service, to anticipate and resolve problems with our Site, to respond to customer support inquiries, and to send other TravelPost administrative and systems-related messages.  We reserve the right to send such communications to our users without offering the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.  We do not send advertisements, newsletters, or any other commercial solicitations to our users.  You should review the following section to understand when TravelPost discloses personal information to non-affiliated third parties. </p>
<h5>Disclosure of Personal Information</h5>
<p>We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except (i) when we have your consent to do so, (ii) as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested, (iii) when required by law, or (iv) when permitted to protect our rights or property.  </p>
<p>Business Transfers:  Information about our users, including personal information, will be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide the Site or fulfill products, sale or pledge of company assets as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.</p> 
<p>Protection of TravelPost and Others:  We release personal information, at our sole discretion, when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights or property, or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.</p>

Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the TravelPost website in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security.
