# Translation Service - Confidentiality - Translated

#### I. Privacy Policy

Translated S.r.l., a company incorporated under Italian law with registered offices on Via Indonesia, No. 23, 00144, Rome, Italy (hereinafter, Translated) — in compliance with the requirements in Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of April 27, 2016 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter GDPR) and Italian data protection law — respects and protects the privacy of users of the site referred to as the translated.com domain, putting in place every possible and proportionate effort not to harm the rights of its users.

The purpose of this privacy policy is to help users understand the procedures that Translated uses in the area of privacy, including what personal data is collected, why it is collected, how it is used, how it is protected, and which individual rights users possess.

This privacy policy does not apply to, and excludes our responsibility, in terms of privacy, information, or other practices of third parties, including third parties who manage websites or services to which the translated.com site refers.

This privacy policy applies to all personal data that Translated acquires or processes when users interact with the translated.com website. Examples include: purchasing and using our services, responding to marketing communications, and contacting Translated customer service. These interactions may involve visitors, clients, suppliers, and/or partners.

Furthermore, Translated processes personal data in areas other than the translated.com site, which require other privacy policies.

#### II. General Information on Data Processing

In this privacy policy, the term “personal data” signifies information that refers to users. It allows us to identify users, directly or in combination with other information in our possession.

##### Users of the Site in General

Translated processes user data based on consent. By using or consulting Translated's site, users explicitly agree to this privacy policy and consent to the processing of their personal data in relation to the purposes and methods described below, including any disclosure to third parties, if necessary, for the provision of service. The provision of data and, consequently, the consent to the gathering and processing of data is optional. The user can deny consent, and may revoke consent at any time. However, denying consent may make it impossible to provide certain services and the browsing experience on the site may be compromised.

##### Clients

Translated shall do everything possible, consistent with the electronic form of service, to maintain the utmost confidentiality in its performance of services. All texts, the nature of the work performed, the personal data of the client communicated for translation purposes, and any information transmitted by the client to Translated are subject to the strictest confidentiality and the personal data collected shall be processed in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR.

In particular, Translated shall use the information provided for the execution of the contract (and for the eventual implementation of pre-contractual measures) and such information can not — without the prior written consent of the client — be disclosed publicly or to third parties, except to its authorized employees or their authorized subcontractors, should their operational or advisory intervention require knowledge of such information. The above guarantees do not apply if Translated is obliged by law to disclose such information, or in the event that such information is, or enters, in the public domain regardless of the disclosure of the same by Translated. This similarly applies to cases in which the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person require the processing of personal data, or where the processing is necessary for the protection of a legitimate interest of Translated or third parties, which is of a higher nature than the rights of the data subject.

##### Suppliers and Collaborators

The personal data of our freelance suppliers and collaborators (suppliers, translators, interpreters, graphic designers, affiliates, consultants, etc.) shall be treated in strict confidence. The only information that shall be communicated to third parties is the information published on our site, such as username, mother tongue, work experience, and studies. Other information such as first name, last name, date of birth, addresses, and telephone numbers shall be processed only by Translated and its authorized suppliers (i.e., accountants, banks, etc.), exclusively for the purpose of the correct execution of the employment relationship with the same and fulfillment of any legal obligations.

#### III. Automatically Collected Information. Web Browsing Data

As with all websites, this site also makes use of log files in which information from user visits is automatically collected and stored. The information collected could include the following:

  * Internet Protocol (IP) Address
  * Type of browser and device parameters used to connect to the site
  * Name of the Internet Service Provider (ISP)
  * Date and time of visit/request
  * Number of clicks, where applicable
  * Method used to submit the request to the server
  * Size of the file obtained in response
  * Digital code indicating the status of the response given by the server
  * Other parameters related to the operating system and the user's IT environment



The information listed above is handled automatically and collected in an exclusively aggregated form in order to verify the correct functioning of the site, and for security reasons. For the purposes of security (spam filters, firewalls, virus detection), automatically registered data may also include personal data such as IP address (the one that uniquely identifies, at least at that time, the host of origin), which could be used — in compliance with the laws in force on the subject — to block attempts to damage the site, harm other users, the carrying out of malicious activities, and activities that constitute a crime. This type of data is used to protect the site and its users.

The listed data is used for the sole purpose of obtaining anonymous statistical information on the use of the website and to check its correct functioning. Consequently, data is deleted immediately after processing. The data used for security purposes (the blocking of attempts to damage the site) is kept for seven days.

However, no data transmission and no storage system can be guaranteed as 100% secure. Users who have reason to believe that their interactions with us are no longer secure are asked to kindly report the issue immediately.

In addition to the Data Controller, in certain cases other parties involved in the running of the website may have access to stored personal data (administrative, sales, legal department, and system administrator personnel) or external individuals (such as third-party technical service providers, mail couriers, hosting providers, IT companies, and communication agencies) which may, if necessary, be appointed by the Data Controller to handle personal data.

The personal data of users shall be kept for as long as necessary, or permitted, in light of the purposes for which it is collected. The criteria adopted for determining storage times are as follows: (i) the period of time in which users regularly use the translated.com site; (ii) the need to fulfill a contract or a legal obligation to which we are subject; (iii) the opportunity to retain data in light of our legal position (for example, with regard to time limits, disputes, or regulatory compliance checks).
