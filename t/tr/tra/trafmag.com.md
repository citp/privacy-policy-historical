#### Privacy policy of on-line advertisement demonstartion

Our technique enables us to demonstrate the users the most relevant advertisements, based on methods of analysis of user activity in the network. The information we gather is never combined with personal data, the advertisements are generated based on anonymous data.

#### Types of anonymous data we gather

Our technique presupposes the usage of non-personal data only. This data contains the history of the web-sites you have visited, advertising links you have followed, the goods you have viewed on the pages of on-line stores, the goods you have added to cart and so on.

#### What this information is used for

All this information helps us choose the advertisement from our partners, which will be most suitable for you. We choose the advertisements based on your prior activity on the web-pages of on-line stores and the non-personal data we have gathered.
