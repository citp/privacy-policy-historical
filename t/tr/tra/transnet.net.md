  * Personal details and employment history and other items as input into the profile and or application 
  * Details of the communication made between Transnet and the applicant and or candidate for the purpose of recruitment activities 
  * Such other data that can easily be collated with other data and thereby enable the identification of the applicant and or candidate 



Transnet uses the applicant and or candidate's personal information for the purposes of providing them with recruitment information; screening for recruitment; and confirming their job application records. If an applicant and or candidate are employed by Transnet, his/her personal data will be continuously used for employee management purposes.

Companies belonging to Transnet and its Operating Divisions will jointly use the personal information of applicants and or candidates for the purposes set forth above.

Transnet accepts, within reasonable limits, an employment applicant's requests for disclosure, amendment and deletion of his/her own personal information. However, Transnet is unable to accept any such requests concerning information related to the screening for employment, to avoid any possible consequence affecting Transnet proper and normal course of business operations. Any personal information of any applicants and or candidates retained by Transnet will, after the purposes of its use have been met, be either, destroyed or deleted by adequate measures.
