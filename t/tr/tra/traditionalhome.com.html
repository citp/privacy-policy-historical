	<h3><a name="Children_Under_13"></a><strong>Children Under 13:</strong></h3>
	<p>Meredith cares about protecting the privacy of children.
	  We won’t knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide
	  us any personally identifying information. Children
	  should always get permission from their parents before
	  sending any information about themselves (such as
	  their names, email addresses, and phone numbers)
	  over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We encourage
	  you to become involved in your children’s online
	  experience, and to share your interest in our sites
	  with your young ones. If you’re under 13, please
	  do not register with any of our sites or provide
	  us with any personally identifying information (such
	  as your name, your email address or your phone number).
  </p><p><a href="#top"> Return to top</a>   
	
  </p><h3><a name="Information_We_Collect"></a><strong>Information We Collect:</strong></h3>
	<p>The information we gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1) information you supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites. Third-party providers featured on, or linked to from, our sites, such as vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may gather information, as well.</p>
	
	 
	
	<h4>Personally Identifying Information</h4>
	<div class="indent">
	  <p><strong>Registration Information.</strong> To use certain features on our sites, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect personally identifying information about you, including your name, mailing address, email address, user name and password. We may also ask for some additional information, such as, hobbies, age, browser type, and the like, but you’re free to register without providing this information if you prefer. In addition, at various other points on our sites, we may ask you for personally identifying information, including when you: place an order for products, complete a survey, or report a problem with one of our sites. We use this information to process your orders, to tailor our sites to your interests and to make them more useful to you, and to help improve our sites generally.</p>
	  <p><strong>Contests and Other Promotions.</strong> From time to time, we may offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, you’ll have to provide some information about yourself (such as your name, address, and email address). We may share this information with sponsors of the contest or other promotional partners, but we will always identify the other parties involved (for example, in the contest rules) and provide notice that your registration may be disclosed to these parties. We don’t control these third parties’ privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection and use of your information. We urge you to review their privacy policies and learn how they will use your information before participating. If you don’t want us to collect the information requested in connection with a promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do not participate in the promotion.</p>
	</div>
	<h4>Tracking Information</h4>
	<div class="indent">
	  <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> To help us serve your
	          needs better, we use "cookies" to store and
	          sometimes to track user information. A cookie
	          is a small amount of data that is sent to
	          your browser from a web server and stored
	          on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie contains
	          a unique number that allows our sites to
	          identify your computer. For example, cookies
	          allow us to keep track of your user name
	          and password (if you are a registered visitor)
	          so you don’t have to re-enter that information
	          each time you visit one of our sites. We
	          also use cookies to make sure you don’t see
	          the same ads repeatedly when you visit our
	          sites. The help function on most browsers
	          contains information on how to set your browser
	          to notify you before accepting cookies or
	          to disable cookies entirely. However, if
	          you don’t accept cookies, you may not be
	          able to take advantage of various features
	          on our sites that are available to other
	          visitors. In addition, our advertising and
	          marketing partners may use their own cookies. </p>
	  <p><strong>Third-Party Advertising Services.</strong> We
	            use the services of DoubleClick, a third-party
	            advertising and email delivery company
	    to serve and target advertisements that you see
	    on the pages of our sites, to serve and target
	    promotions or other marketing messages, and to
	    send e-mails from us. DoubleClick also collects "clickstream data," information about your visit to our sites and to third-party sites that can be aggregated and used to target advertising on this and other sites, and used for marketing research and other similar purposes. This clickstream data does not include personally identifying information such as your name, address, email address or telephone number. DoubleClick uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and collects information directly from our users. We share website usage information about visitors to our sites who have received a targeted promotional campaign with DoubleClick to facilitate targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and DoubleClick note some of the pages you visit on our website through the use of pixel tags (also called "clear gifs" or "web beacons"). If you would like to know more about DoubleClick information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures,
	        please see the privacy statement on the <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" target="_blank">DoubleClick website</a>.</p>
	  <p><strong>Browser Level Information and IP Addresses.</strong> When
	            you use our sites, we may also collect
	    information about your access time and your computer
	      configuration, including the type of browser
	    software you use, the operating system that you’re
	    running, the resolution of your computer monitor
	    and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your
	    IP address is a number that is used by computers
	    connected to the Internet to identify your computer
	    so that data (such as the web pages you request)
	    can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell
	    us who you are. Like the IP address, none of the
	    other information described in this paragraph identifies
	      you personally. We collect this information for
	      purposes of aggregated reporting on site activity
	      that we, and our advertisers, may use. For example,
	      we may want to know how long the average user
	    spends on our site, which pages or features get
	    the most attention, and the like. The aggregated
	    information helps to understand our audience and
	    confirm the value of advertising on our websites.</p>

	<h3><a name="How_your_information_will_be_used"></a><strong>How Your Information Will Be Used:</strong></h3> 
	
	<p>Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a customized experience when visiting our sites and to make our sites more valuable to you. </p>
	
	 
	
	<div class="indent">
	  <p><strong>Vendors and Service Providers.</strong> To
	    make your experience on our sites more useful and
	    enjoyable, we may offer some features (such as
	    chat rooms and email newsletters) in conjunction
	    with third party providers ("Provider Partners")
	    that specialize in operating such services. We
	    share with each of these Provider Partners such
	    information as is necessary to provide you with
	    the services we provide you in conjunction with
	    that Provider Partner. Their use of this information
	    will be subject to the terms of their respective
	    privacy policies, which you can find on their websites. <em>We will not provide your email address to such third parties unless it’s necessary to provide the services you have requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored promotion.</em> </p>
	  <p><strong>Sites to Which We Link.</strong> We also may provide links to other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don’t control. When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our websites, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you’re visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services through our sites, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it appears that you’re on one of our sites throughout the transaction. The provider’s privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can’t find the privacy policy of any of our providers via a link either from the site’s homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information.</p>
	  <p><strong>Shopping.</strong> When you are ready to make a purchase through one of our sites, we will ask you to provide us with certain information, including your contact details (such as your name, address, telephone and email), and your billing information (such as your credit card number and the date that your card expires). We will use the information you provide us to process your transaction and to contact you regarding your purchase if necessary. We will share this information with the relevant merchant to the extent necessary to facilitate your purchase (for purposes such as customer service, verification, fulfillment and billing purposes). We may share non-financial information with such merchants in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
	  <p><strong>Our Other Websites.</strong> When you register for one of our sites, the information that you provide will be added to a centralized Meredith database so that you will simultaneously be registered for our other sites as well. We may share the information that we collect from you with other divisions of Meredith so that we and they can offer you products and services that we may believe may be of interest to you.</p>
	  <p><strong>Postal Address Lists.</strong> If you provide us with your postal address, we may include that address in postal address lists that we sell or rent to third parties. If you would like us to stop including your postal address in such lists, please send us a letter (which should be addressed to Meredith Corporation, Opt-Out Postal, Attn: Circulation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309), requesting that we remove your postal address from these lists. If we receive such a letter from you, we will act as promptly as possible to remove your postal address from future postal address lists that we sell or rent to third parties.</p>
	  <p><strong>Other Disclosures.</strong> We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our <a href="http://www.traditionalhome.com/visitoragreement">Visitor Agreement</a>, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites, the public, or Meredith Corporation. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Meredith Corporation, substantially all of our assets, or one or more of our sites (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets. </p>

If you have opted to receive a particular newsletter, you can always unsubscribe later either (1) by following the ’unsubscribe’ link located near the bottom of each newsletter, or (2) by going to <a href="https://w1.buysub.com/servlet/CSGateway?cds_mag_code=TRH&amp;cds_page_id=85415">My Account</a>,

	  <p><strong>Promotional Emails.</strong> If you provide us with your email address, from time to time we may send you emails about Meredith products, services and special offers (such as special Meredith magazine subscription offers) that we believe may be of interest to you. When you register, you will also be given an opportunity to tell us whether you would like to receive emails about products, services and special offers from third-party providers. Though we hope that you will find both types of promotional emails helpful, if you decide that you no longer wish to receive either or both types of emails, please go to the <a href="https://secure.traditionalhome.com/common/profile/member/optout">Email Preferences</a>  page and update your preferences.

We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our sites is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don’t want people to know your name or email address, for example, make sure not to include it in any message you post publicly.

	<h2><a name="Your_California_Privacy_Policy"></a>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
	<p><strong>(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</strong></p>
	
	 
	
	<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 - also known as the "Shine the Light" law -  California residents have a right to request certain information from each business they patronize regarding that business's disclosures of personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.  Generally, if a business has disclosed personal information regarding its California customers to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, the business is required to provide, upon request and free of charge, a list of the names and addresses of all such third parties, together with a list of the categories of personal information that was disclosed.</p>  
	
	 
	
	<p>The "Shine The Light" law creates an exception for businesses that adopt and disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a policy of not sharing personal information for direct marketing purposes without offering their customers choices to prevent such disclosures.  These businesses are not obligated to provide the lists described above and may respond to requests from California customers by notifying them of their rights to prevent disclosures of personal information for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free means of exercising those rights.  </p>
	
	 
	
	<p>Meredith Corporation qualifies for this latter exception.  As further explained in our <a href="#Online_Privacy_Policy">Online Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://secure.meredith.com/privacy/policy.html">Offline
	Privacy Policy</a>, we offer our customers choices to prevent the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.  To prevent such disclosures of your information, please follow the instructions in our "Shine The Light" Customer Notice, which is included below for your convenience.  You can also request a copy of this Notice by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@meredith.com">privacy@meredith.com</a>.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request for per California customer during the course of any calendar year and we reserve the right not to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>
