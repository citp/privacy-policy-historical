      <p>Welcome to our website! <i>Traditional Home</i> is a service 
	  provided by Meredith    Corporation. Since 1902, Meredith has been committed to providing our 
        customers with products and services characterized by outstanding quality, 
        customer service and value. Our Online Privacy Policy continues our commitment 
        to serve you and to protect your privacy online. NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY 
        POLICY APPLIES ONLY TO OUR ONLINE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION.</p>
      <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our

      <p><b>Children Under 13</b>:<br>
        Meredith cares about the safety of children. Kids under 13 are not allowed 
        to register with our website or to participate in public posting areas 
        on our sites. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any 
        personally identifying information. Children should always get permission 
        from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such 
        as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, 
        to us or to anyone else. We encourage you to become involved in your children's 
        online experience, and to share your interest in our sites with your young 
        ones.</p><a name="information"></a>
      <p><b>Information We Collect</b>:<br>
        The information we gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1) 
        information you supply when you register or initiate transactions, and 
        (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites. 
        Third-party providers featured on or linked to by our websites, such as 
        vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may gather 
        the same kinds of information.</p>
      <p>Personally Identifiable Information</p>
      <p>To use certain features on our sites, we ask you to register. When you 
        register, we collect personally identifiable information about you including 
        your name, mailing address, email address, user name and password. We 
        may also ask for some additional information, for example, hobbies, age, 
        browser type, and the like, but you're free to register without providing 
        this information if you prefer. In addition, at various other points on 
        our sites, we may ask you for personal information including when you: 
        place an order for products, complete a survey, and report a problem with 
        one of our sites. We use this information to process your orders and to 
        help improve our sites.</p>
      <p>From time to time, we also may offer contests or other promotions involving 
        marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one 
        of these contests or promotions, you'll have to provide some information 
        about yourself (such as name, address, and email address). We may share 
        this information with co-sponsors of the contest or other promotional 
        partners, but we will always identify the other parties involved (for 
        example, in the contest rules). We don't control these third parties' 
        privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection 
        and use of personal information. We urge you to review their privacy policies 
        and learn how they will use the information before participating. If you 
        don't want us to collect the information requested in the promotion, or 
        to provide it to our cosponsors or partners, please do not participate 
        in the promotion.</p>
      <p>Aggregate Information</p>
      <p>To help us serve your needs better, we use "cookies" to store 
        and sometimes to track user information. A cookie is a small amount of 
        data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your 
        computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our 
        sites to identify your computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep 
        track of your user name and password (if you are a registered visitor) 
        so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you visit our 
        site. We also use cookies to make sure you don't see the same ads repeatedly 
        when you visit our sites. The help function on most browsers contains 
        information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting 
        cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, 
        you won't be able to take advantage of various features on our sites that 
        are available to other visitors. In addition, our advertising and marketing 
        partners may use their own cookies. </p>
      <p>We use the services of a third-party advertising and email delivery company 
        to serve and target advertisements that you see on the pages of our sites 
        and to serve and target promotions or other marketing messages and to 
        send e-mails from us. This advertising company also collects "clickstream 
        data," information about your visit to our site and to other sites, 
        that can be aggregated and used to target advertising on this and other 
        sites, and used for marketing research and other similar purposes. This 
        clickstream data does not include personally identifying information such 
        as your name, address, email address or telephone number. This advertising 
        company uses cookies for many of the same reasons we do, and collects 
        information directly from our users. We share web site usage information 
        about visitors to our web site, who have received a targeted promotional 
        campaign, with this advertising company for the purpose of targeting future 
        campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. 
        For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company note some 
        of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of pixel tags (also 
        called clear gifs). If you would like to know more about its information 
        gathering practice and "opt-out" procedures, please see the 
        privacy statement on the DoubleClick website by clicking <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" target="_blank">here</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>When you use our sites, we may also collect your browser type, access 
        time, and/or Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and keep records 
        of this information. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers 
        connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such 
        as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does 
        not tell us who you are. Like the IP address, none of this other information 
        identifies you personally either; we collect it for aggregate reporting 
        on site activity that we, and our advertisers, may use. For example, we 
        may want to know how long the average user spends on our site, which pages 
        or features get the most attention, and the like. The aggregate information 
        helps to understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising 
        on our websites.</p><a name="information2"></a>
      <p><b>How Your Information Will Be Used</b>:<br>
        Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a customized 
        experience when visiting our sites and to make our sites more valuable 
        to you. We try to ensure that the banner advertisements we deliver to 
        you are consistent with your interests. We may also email you with messages 
        and advertising that we think may be of interest to you. </p>
      <p>To make your online experience more useful and enjoyable, our sites include 
        links to other websites, and provide access to products and services offered 
        by third-parties. We share with these third-parties such information as 
        is necessary to provide the products or services. We will not provide 
        your email address to such third-parties unless it's necessary to provide 
        services you have requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored 
        promotion. For example, we will provide your name and email address to 
        a marketing partner from which you're purchasing goods or services. We 
        also may provide links to other websites, and provide access to products 
        and services offered by third-parties, whose privacy policies we don't 
        control. When you access another website or purchase products or services 
        or conduct other transactions through our websites, use of any information 
        you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site 
        you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you 
        provide information in the course of obtaining products or services through 
        our sites, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy 
        policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it appears 
        that you're on our site throughout the transaction. The provider's privacy 
        policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any 
        of our provider partners via a link either from the site's homepage or 
        from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should 
        contact the provider directly for more information.</p>
      <p>In addition, we may share some personal information (but not your email 
        address) with other companies that offer marketing information or products 
        that we think will be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive 
        such mailings, please tell us. Send your request with your name and complete 
        address to Circulation Department, Meredith Corporation, 1716 Locust Street, 
        Des Moines, Iowa 50309-3023.</p>
      <p>We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release 
        is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our <a href="termsofuse.htm">Visitor Agreement</a>, or 
        to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites, the 
        public, or Meredith Corporation. As our business grows, we may buy or 
        sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Meredith Corporation, 
        substantially all of our assets, or one or more of our sites (or substantially 
        all of its assets) is acquired by another company, information on our 
        visitors would be among the transferred assets.</p>
		<a name="correct"></a>
      <p><b>How to correct or update your information</b>:<br>
        Meredith Corporation believes strongly in providing you with the ability 
        to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to 
        us. To update the information retained about you please visit our <a href="membercenter.htm">Member 
        Services</a> area.</p>
		<a name="optout"></a>
      <p><b>Opt-out Information for</b>:
      <br>
        Newsletters: If you no longer wish to receive e-mail newsletters, you 
        can either (1) follow the 'update newsletter preferences' link located 
        near the bottom of each message or (2) go to the <a href="membercenter.htm">Member Center</a> and click 
        on the link to 'update your profile' and change your newsletter selections 
        on the third page.</p>
      <p>Promotional E-mails: If you do not wish to receive email promotions from 
        us, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:dropme@mdp.com">dropme@mdp.com</a> with "Opt-out of Marketing" 
        in the subject line to "opt out." Of course, you may change 
        your preferences at any time. We will make any changes you request as 
        quickly as we can. </p>
		<a name="security"></a>
      <p><b>Security and Passwords</b>:<br>
        The personally identifiable information we collect is securely stored 
        within our database, and we use standard, industry-wide procedures such 
        as encryption, firewalls and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting 
        your information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no 
        security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our 
        database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted 
        while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information 
        you include in a message you post to any message board, discussion group, 
        or other public posting area on our sites is available to anyone with 
        Internet access. If you don't want people to know your name or email address, 
        for example, make sure not to include it in any message you post publicly. 
        Please see our <a href="termsofuse.htm">Visitor Agreement</a> for more information related to posting 
        materials on our sites, including our use of such materials.</p>
		<a name="misc"></a>
      <p><b>Miscellaneous</b>: <br>
        The Internet is an evolving medium. If we need to change our Privacy Policy 
        at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect. 
        By visiting any of our sites, you agree that your visit, and any dispute 
        over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy and our <a href="termsofuse.htm">Visitor Agreement</a>. 
        Please read both carefully before using or registering with any of our 
        sites.</p>
