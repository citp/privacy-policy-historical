        We respect the privacy of those who visit our web site and those
          who become subscribers. In accordance with this, we have created this
          policy in order to demonstrate our privacy commitment to our users:</p>
        <h5> What this Privacy Policy Covers</h5>
        <ul>
          <li> This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable
            information that we collect when you are on our site, and when you
            use our services. This policy also covers our treatment of any personally
            identifiable information that third parties share with us.</li>
          <li> This policy does not apply to the practices of organizations that
            we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5> Information We Collect</h5>
        <ul>
          <li> We collect personally identifiable information when you register
            for an account, when you use our services, and when you visit our
            pages. We may also receive personally identifiable information from
            third parties.</li>
          <li> When you register with us, we ask for your name and email address,
            and you may also supply other personal details and interests if you
            want to. Once you register with us and sign in to our services, you
            are not anonymous to us.</li>
          <li> <strong>Log File Information:</strong> We also automatically receive and record information on our server
            logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information
            and the page you requested. This information is not linked to your
            account and will not be used to identify you.</li>
          <li><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> When you visit our web site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of our service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear Gifs Information:</strong> When you use our web site, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Company account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make us better for our users.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>DoubleClick DART cookies</h5>
        <ul>
          <li> We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s  DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are  browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising  (including some Google AdSense advertisements).&nbsp; This cookie is used to  serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based  targeting”).&nbsp; The ads served will be targeted based on your previous  browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about  visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when  viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).&nbsp; DART uses  “non personally identifiable information”.&nbsp; It does NOT track personal  information about you, such as your name, email address, physical  address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account  numbers or credit card numbers.&nbsp; You can opt-out of this ad serving on  all sites using this advertising by visiting <a linkindex="32" href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          <li>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or  third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing  preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; However,  this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as  other websites.&nbsp; This could include the inability to login to services  or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</li>
          <li>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any  advertising program.&nbsp; Unless you have settings that disallow cookies,  the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie  will be added. </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How We Use This Information</h5>
        <ul>
          <li> We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of our web site. Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the web site(for instance, in User Content you post) becomes available to the public.

          <li>By providing us with your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by sending an email message to support@travelsignposts.com with the word "No email" in the subject field.  Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. </li>
          <li>We may use certain information about you and/or your User Content without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how our web site is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions.</li>
          <li>We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the site. We have the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation, if in our sole opinion, such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. We also reserve the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</li>
          <li>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.        </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h5>
        <ul>

            to anyone.</li>
          <li> We will only send personally identifiable information about you

              <li>We have your consent to share the information; </li>
              <li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or </li>
              <li>We find that your actions on our web sites violate the Terms
                of Service</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Company (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</li>
          <li>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</li>
          <li>Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, we will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the Company, our users or others.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Company services.</li>
          <li>We allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on our web site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on our web site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</li>
          <li>We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</li>
          <li>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. Our privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers. </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How We Protect Your Information</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
