We may also receive personally identifiable information from third parties.</li><li> When you register with us, we ask for your name and email address, and you may also supply other personal details and interests if you want to. Once you register with us and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.</li><li> <strong>Log File Information:</strong> We also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information and the page you requested. This information is not linked to your account and will not be used to identify you.</li><li><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> When you visit our web site, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.
