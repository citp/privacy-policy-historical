This information may be collected from you during any interactions you have with us, for example when you visit our website, make a booking, call us or send us an email, answer a survey, enter a contest or a draw or subscribe to a loyalty program organized by Transat or on behalf Transat. It may also come from one of our suppliers who provides services to you on our behalf or from one of our suppliers or partners, for example when you book via a travel agency.

### What personal information do we collect?

#### **Identification**

Your name, date of birth, gender, nationality and passport number. If your minor children are included in the booking, we will collect their identification information.

When providing sensitive personal information, explicit consent to the processing of this information must be given. This sensitive personal information will be used strictly to allow us to provide any special services requested and to fully perform our obligations.

#### **Third Party bookings**

A third-party booking is when a family member, friend, travel agent or another person (“Third Party”) makes a booking on your behalf. This Third Party will necessarily provide us with the same personal information that we would collect from you directly in order to complete your booking. In such circumstances, the Third Party will have ensured that you have been made aware of the content of this privacy policy and that you consent to supply your personal information to us.

### How do we use your personal information?

SSL allows a secure connection between your internet browser and our internet server, using a private (or secret) key to encrypt the information.

In addition, we require any third-party suppliers who handle our customers’ personal information to comply with data protection legislation relevant to the services they are providing.

In this respect, we specify that : (i) Canada has been recognized by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection, likewise New Zealand, Argentina, Switzerland and Israel ; (ii) with regard to the transfer of data to the United States, your personal information will only be transferred to third-parties who undertook to provide guarantees as to the secure processing of personal data in accordance with the Privacy Shield recognized by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection; for additional information, please refer to the website [www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/); (iii) for other countries, we have ascertained that the recipients of your personal information have put in place the appropriate safeguards in order to ensure that your personal information is adequately protected, the whole in accordance with the data protection legislation in force.
