<p>This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting,
using, and disclosing your information. Users can access the Transifex
service (the "Service") through our website www.transifex.com,
applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties.
A "Device" is any computer used to access the Transifex Service, including
without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other
consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access
of the Transifex Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using
our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage,
disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the
different forms of data, content, and information described below are
collectively referred to as “information.”</p>
<h3>1. The Information We Collect And Store</h3>
<p>We may collect and store the following information when running the
Transifex Service:</p>
<p><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> When you register an account, we collect some
personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or
other billing information, email address and home and business postal
addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us
access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or
to use your social networking information if you give us access to your
account on social network connection services. When you invite others
to join Transifex by using our referral page, we send them a one-time
email for that referral. You may also provide us with your contacts’ email
addresses when sharing folders or files with them. We may also receive
Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other
users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to
refer Transifex to you.</p>
<p><strong>Files.</strong> We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access
with the Transifex Service ("Files"). If you add a file to your Transifex that
has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate
all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a
duplicate.</p>
<p><strong>Log Data.</strong> When you use the Service, we automatically record information
from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This
may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type,
the web page visited before you came to our website, information you
search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers
associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps
associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata
concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> We also use "cookies" to collect information and improve our
Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device.
We may use "persistent cookies" to save your registration ID and login
password for future logins to the Service. We may use "session ID
cookies"" to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand
how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web
traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing
its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a
cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however,
you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.</p>
<h3>2. How We Use Personal Information</h3>
<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> In the course of using the Service, we may collect
personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal
Information”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and
improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better
understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve
your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product
announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from
us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those
communications, or update your account settings information.</p>
<p><strong>Geo-Location Information.</strong> Some Devices allow applications to access
real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). We may use this
information to optimize your experience. Also, some of the information we
collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to
approximate a Device’s location.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics.</strong> We also collect some information (ourselves or using third
party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which
can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this
information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of
the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our
Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the
authorization needed for the Service to process their requests. As of the
date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics and KISSMetrics.
To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, click <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">here</a>, and
to learn more about the privacy policy of KISSMetrics, click <a href="http://www.kissmetrics.com/privacy">here</a>, learn how
to opt out of that services click <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a> for Google and <a href="http://www.kissmetrics.com/user-privacy">here</a> for KISSMetrics.</p>
<h3>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p><strong>Your Use.</strong> We will display your Personal Information in your profile page
and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in
your account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how
much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what
information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of
anonymity. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.
We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may also
share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you
use a third party application to access your account (see below). Through
certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make
some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and
quickly disseminated.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.</strong> We may use certain
trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze,
and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage,
maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment
processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third
parties may have access to your information only for purposes of
performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those
in this Privacy Policy. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use
RackSpace storage service to store some of your information (for example,
your Words). We use Stripe to manage your online payment service. You
can find more information on Rackspace’s data security <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/whyrackspace/network/datacenters/">here</a> and
from Stripe's online payment system <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Applications.</strong> We may share your information with a third party
application with your consent, for example when you choose to access
our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what
those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust
the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of
Transifex's Rights.</strong> We may disclose to parties outside Transifex words
stored in Transifex and information about you that we collect when we
have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a)
comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the
safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud
or abuse of Transifex or its users; or (d) to protect Transifex’s property
rights.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of
all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part
of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a
prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your
Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different
Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding
the information.</p>
<p><strong>Non-private or Non-Personal Information.</strong> We may disclose your non-
private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage
statistics of our Service.</p>
<h3>4. Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>
<p>If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete
the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile
by changing your account settings. If your personally identifiable
information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may
update or delete it by making the change on your account settings. In
some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law.
For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please
contact privacy@transifex.com. We will respond to your inquiry within 30
days.</p>
<h3>5. Word Retention</h3>
<p>We will retain your information, which may include general personal
information, for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide
you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no
longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your
account. We may retain and use your information as necessary
to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your
information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might
be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions
might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers
files that you have in common with other users.</p>
<h3>6. Transifex Community</h3>
<p>Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs,
forums, and wikis. You should be aware that any information you provide
in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access
them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account. For
questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact
privacy@transifex.com.</p>
<p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may
differ from those of Transifex. If you submit personal information to any of
those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We
encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you
visit.</p>
<h3>7. Security</h3>
<p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter
sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms,
we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer
technology (SSL).</p>
<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information
submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No
method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any
questions about security on our website, you can view our <a href="/about/security/">Security
Overview Page</a> or contact us at security@transifex.com.</p>
<h3>8. Our Policy Toward Children</h3>
<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 18. We do not knowingly
collect personally identifiable information from children under 18. If a
parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us
with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact
us at privacy@transifex.com. If we become aware that a child under 18
has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete
such information from our files.</p>
<h3>9. Contacting Us</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
privacy@transifex.com or at 94 Solaris Avenue, Camana Bay, P.O. Box 1384, 
Cayman Islands KY1-1108.</p>
<h3>10. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change
to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we
will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide
notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the
Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by
the revised Privacy Policy.</p></div>
