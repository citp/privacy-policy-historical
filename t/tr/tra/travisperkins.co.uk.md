**What information do we collect and how do we use it?**

We will not collect any personal information about you unless you have chosen to give it to us. If you require further information, wish to open an account or would like to contact your local branch, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number so that we can contact you accordingly. When you enter a competition or promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number so we can administer the competition and notify winners. 

We may use the information provided by you to communicate with you, to provide a more personalised online experience, for record keeping purposes, and in aggregate (and therefore anonymously) for market research purposes, to track activity on our site, to publish trends and/or to improve usefulness and content. We may also use the information we collect to keep you updated with information about promotional offers and what is coming soon at Travis Perkins. If you do not wish to receive this information please let us know by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/privacy-optout.asp) and completing the form.

We may use other companies to provide services on our behalf. These services may include but are not limited to answering customers' questions about products or services, sending postal mail and e-mails and analysing data. We will only provide those companies with the information they need to deliver the service and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

We never make your personal details available to companies outside the Travis Perkins plc Group for marketing purposes.

**How is customer information protected?**

Internally, we restrict access to personal information. Only employees who need the information in order to do their jobs have access to it.
