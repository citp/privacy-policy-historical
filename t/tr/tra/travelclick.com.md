# TravelCLICK | Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to TravelCLICK, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "TravelCLICK"). In our normal course of business, TravelCLICK handles personal information, including personal information collected through use of this website ([www.travelclick.com](http://www.travelclick.com/)) and other sources. We handle all personal information in our possession in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

Personal information that we receive from or on behalf of third parties, including our customers and partners, may also be governed by the privacy policies of the respective entity collecting such information. We are not responsible for the policies or actions of our customers or partners with respect to personal information that they collect or that we collect on their behalf. 

We also adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles of the United States Department of Commerce in our handling of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.

Notice  


We receive personal information from our customers and partners and, in some cases, directly from individuals when we act as a contractor for our customers and partners. We use this information to reserve hotel accommodations and to provide related services to our customers and to individuals on behalf of our customers. We also offer industry-related analysis, reporting and marketing services to our customers and other third parties in the hospitality industry, which may involve compilation of general information, such as dates or length of stay, that does not identify individuals. 

We also obtain personal information from individuals who voluntarily submit it to us by requesting products, services or other information through this website or other communications with TravelCLICK. In addition, when individuals visit this website, we utilize cookie technology to collect data that allows us to identify whether they are first time or return visitors. Cookies allow us to provide faster data retrieval for return visitors. We also use information we collect from online use of this website to communicate with individuals and for other marketing purposes.

Security  


TravelCLICK maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards that we believe are reasonably designed to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, because no security program is impenetrable and criminals have proven apt at circumventing widely-adopted security safeguards, we cannot guarantee the security of the personal information we maintain. 

Onward Transfer  


We may utilize the services of third party partners to help us manage our business and provide goods and services to our customers and partners. If we share personal information with third parties, we require that they apply reasonable information security and confidentiality controls and that they only use such information received from us for the intended purpose. TravelCLICK may, however, disclose any personal information as required by law, court order or other valid legal processes or in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of TravelCLICK's assets.

Choice  


Should you sign up for our email list and then change your mind and no longer wish to receive e-mail or periodic mailings from us in the future, please let us know by sending an e-mail to [Unsubscribe@travelclick.com](mailto:Unsubscribe@travelclick.com) with your email address in the subject line. 

If you do not want your personal information to be used or transferred to third parties as set forth in this Privacy Policy, you may send an email to [cs@travelclick.com](mailto:cs@travelclick.com).

You can also adjust your Internet browser settings to refuse all cookies. However, some TravelCLICK features and services may not operate properly or as quickly if your cookies are disabled.

Data Integrity  


Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, TravelCLICK does not process personal information for any purpose other than the purposes for which it is collected without prior consent of our customers and partners or the individual. We have also implemented controls, such as monitoring and reporting processes, to help maintain data that is accurate, complete and reliable for its intended use, but we rely on our customers and partners  and individuals to update or correct personal information whenever necessary.

Access  


We will provide you with access to your personal information in our possession upon request, subject to a reasonable handling charge. You may request, correct or update such information by sending an email to [cs@travelclick.com](mailto:cs@travelclick.com), with “privacy policy update” in the subject line. We will also delete your personal information from our systems, upon your written request, unless we are required to retain it by law or other legal obligation. 

Enforcement  


We monitor and verify compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles and this Privacy Policy through an objective self-assessment process. As part of this process, we regularly review our systems and procedures for compliance and effective operation.    

Your satisfaction is important to us. If you have a complaint regarding the use or maintenance of your personal information by TravelCLICK, please contact us at [cs@travelclick.com](mailto:cs@travelclick.com).

We will investigate all complaints promptly and diligently to address your concerns and resolve any disputes quickly. If a complaint or dispute cannot be resolved through our internal process, we agree to independent dispute resolution procedures administered by the American Arbitration Association.

Additional Information  


If you have additional questions or concerns, you may contact us at [cs@travelclick.com](mailto:cs@travelclick.com).
