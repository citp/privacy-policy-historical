# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to TravelClick, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “TravelClick”) and information collected through use of this website ([www.travelclick.com/](http://www.travelclick.com/)) and online TravelClick products and services related to the hospitality industry (“Services”).

Personal information that we receive from or on behalf of third parties, including our customers and business partners, is governed by the privacy policies of the respective entity collecting such information. For example, the personal information that we receive from individuals using our Services to make a hotel reservation belongs to the hotel property. We are not responsible for the policies or actions of our customers or business partners with respect to personal information.

We adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles of the United States Department of Commerce in our handling of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. To learn more about the Safe Harbor Program, and to view TravelClick’s certification of adherence to these Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement, please visit www.export.gov/safeharbor.

#### Notice

We receive personal information from our customers and business partners and, in some cases, directly from individuals when we act as a contractor for our customers and partners in providing our Services. 

We also obtain personal information from individuals who voluntarily submit it to us by requesting products, services or other information through this website, by participating in surveys or promotions or by engaging in other communications with TravelClick. The personal information we collect online may be combined with information that we receive from other offline sources, including from third party business partners. In addition, when individuals visit this website and the websites of our customers, we utilize technology to collect data that allows us to identify whether they are first time or return visitors.

This technology may also allow us to provide faster data retrieval for return visitors.

We use the information we collect to reserve hotel accommodations and to provide related Services to our customers and to individuals on behalf of our customers. We also offer industry-related analysis, reporting and marketing services to our customers and other third parties in the hospitality industry.

We may further use any information that we collect, including personal information, to administer, operate and improve our website, our Services and our business. We also use information we collect to communicate with individuals and for other marketing purposes.

#### Security

No security program is impenetrable and criminals have proven adept at circumventing widely-adopted security safeguards, so we cannot guarantee the security of the personal information you transmit to us.  Accordingly, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk.

Any customer, hotel property, reseller, user or other third party accessing TravelClick’s website or Services is responsible for its own use of the website and the Services. TravelClick is not responsible for any third party’s actions or their security controls with respect to information that third parties may collect or process via the website or Services. 

#### Onward Transfer

We may utilize third party service providers to help us manage our business and provide goods and services to our customers and business partners. We may also share personal information with our customers, business partners and our affiliates for their own marketing and internal business purposes.If we share personal information with third parties, we require that they only use such information received from us for the intended purpose.

TravelClick may, however, disclose any personal information as required by law, court order or other valid legal processes or in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of TravelClick, any of TravelClick’s business lines, or all or substantially all of TravelClick's assets or a TravelClick business line’s assets.
