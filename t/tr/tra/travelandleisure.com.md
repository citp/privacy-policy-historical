# Privacy Statement

At American Express Publishing Corporation ("AEP"), we value and protect your privacy. We thank you for the trust that you place in us and we want you to know that the information you share with us will be treated with care.

The objective of our Privacy Statement is to disclose and explain what information we collect, use, and share and to explain the privacy choices that you can make. We encourage you to read our Privacy Statement as well as those of all websites that you visit.

This Privacy Statement applies to any information collected by AEP or its "Vendors" via: (1) the websites owned or operated by AEP ("AEP Websites" or "Websites"), (2) e-mail or any electronic newsletters in which you enroll, (3) offline means such as telephone, traditional mail, or in person, or (4) any other online or offline means in connection with AEP generally or with any of the AEP products and services listed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20121231001455id_/http://www.amexpub.com/privacy/products). AEP may provide links to third-party websites. Since we do not control third-party sites and are not responsible for any information you may provide while on such sites, we encourage you to read the privacy policies on those sites before providing any of your "Personally Identifiable Information" ("PII") on such sites.

## The Information We Collect

When you visit the AEP Websites, we or our Vendors collect information, including PII that you provide, in order to provide you with the products and services you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you, service your accounts, and save you time and better respond to your needs.

We use "Cookie" technology to collect Website statistical information and to improve your customer experience with the AEP Websites. Cookies set by AEP do not capture any PII. However, if you choose to furnish us with PII, this information may be linked to the data stored in the Cookie to further enhance your experience with our Websites. For example, we may use Cookies to personalize your experience at our Websites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our Websites), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Websites. We also may use Cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.

When browsing the AEP Websites, you may choose not to provide us with any PII, such as by choosing not to register or to login. When you browse in this way, we will not link your Cookie information with the account(s) you may have with AEP.

We or our Vendors also automatically collect some statistical data as you browse our Websites. For example, we automatically collect your "IP Address" used to connect your computer to the Internet, browser type and version, operating system and platform, average time spent on our Websites, pages viewed, information searched for, access times, "Clickstream Data," and other relevant information about your online experience.

AEP may also use "Web Beacons" to present offers on the AEP Websites, or other websites on which AEP advertises. In addition, e-mail offers that we send you may contain Web Beacons to help us record response rates, assist in measuring the offer's effectiveness, and/or generally enhance the relevance of e-mail offers. We sometimes use Vendors to manage Web Beacons and the data they collect; however, Web Beacons do not capture any PII that you enter on the AEP Websites.

We or our Vendors also collect information, including PII, that you provide via telephone, traditional mail, e-mail, in person, or otherwise.

At some AEP Websites and through certain promotions, you can submit information, including PII, about other people. For example, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, we might collect the recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

## How We Use and Share The Information We Collect

AEP uses the information we or our Vendors collect about you and others, including PII, to complete transactions, respond to your requests, deliver the products and services in which you enroll or request, and notify you of updates, products, services, offers, or promotions that may interest you. We may process or combine your information with other information that is publicly available. This enables us to customize your customer experience and provide you with more relevant offers. AEP may also use the information that we or our Vendors collect from you online and via other means to market to you through alternative channels.

AEP may share your information within our American Express family of companies. To provide products and services to you or offers that may interest you, we may also share your information with carefully selected Vendors with whom we work. This includes companies that manage accounts and companies that perform marketing services and other business operations for us. All companies that act on our behalf are required to safeguard PII.

AEP may share your information with "Business Partners" carefully selected by us that may wish to offer you products or services that may interest you, either in conjunction with AEP or by themselves.

We may also use or disclose your information, including PII, to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process, or as otherwise permitted by law; to report or collect debts owed; to reduce fraud or criminal activity; to protect the legal rights of AEP, our customers, our Websites, or the users of our Websites; or to allow a purchaser of an AEP division, or AEP as a whole, to continue using your information to serve you or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Statement.

## Using Your E-Mail Address

We may use your e-mail address for the following types of e-mail messages:

  * **Account Service Communications.** We may send you communications related to AEP products and services in which you are enrolled (e.g., subscription and membership communications).
  * **Updates and Valuable Offers.** We may send you e-mail account updates, offers for our products and services, requests for enrollment, as well as valuable offers from our Business Partners that we send you on their behalf. 
  * **Regularly Scheduled E-mail Newsletters** that you elected to receive.



You can also elect to receive other types of e-mail messages from us, including alerts and notifications.

## Advertisements That Link to Our Websites

AEP hires Vendors to place advertisements on the AEP Websites and our banner advertisements on other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting activities on the AEP Websites and other websites. This enables us to learn which advertisements and websites bring users to our Websites and to improve the user experience. Cookies are used to assist with these activities. In doing so, a unique Cookie is placed on your computer either by us or a Vendor in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement.

This Privacy Statement does not cover any use of information that such Vendors may have collected from you or the methods used by them to collect that information. Rather, such Vendors have their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about their privacy policies, including information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, please visit [this link](https://web.archive.org/privacy/optout/thirdparty).

## Transfers of Information to Other Countries

Some of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Statement may involve the transfer of your PII to various countries around the world. By submitting your PII to AEP via an AEP Website or otherwise, you consent to such transfers.

  * How To Opt Out of Receiving Offers and Promotions



AEP respects the choices that you make regarding your privacy. You may request that we no longer send you e-mails and/or offline offers or promotions, or share your information with our Business Partners that are interested in providing you with offers and promotions that may interest you.

  * If you do not want to receive future offers or promotions from AEP via e-mail, please [click here](http://www.amexpub.com/privacy/optout/aepemail). In addition, if you have elected to receive certain marketing e-mails from AEP but decide that you no longer want to receive them, you may also follow the unsubscribe instructions that are located at the bottom of those e-mail messages.
  * If you do not want to receive future offers or promotions from AEP via offline means, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20121231001455id_/http://www.amexpub.com/privacy/optout/aepoffline).
  * If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with our Business Partners in the future so that they can e-mail you information about products or services that may interest you, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20121231001455id_/http://www.amexpub.com/privacy/optout/bpemail).
  * If you do not want us to share your PII with our Business Partners in the future so that they can use offline means to provide you with information about products or services that may interest you, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20121231001455id_/http://www.amexpub.com/privacy/optout/bpoffline).



Please note that even if you opt out of receiving e-mails and/or offline offers or promotions, we may continue to send you service notifications via e-mails or offline means that are related to your account(s) and other products and services you have requested or in which you are currently enrolled. These include e-mails that provide account information (including information about the expiration and possible renewal of any subscription you have with AEP and other servicing communications based on your customer status), answer your questions about a product or service, facilitate or confirm a sale, or fulfill a legal or regulatory requirement.

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your PII from unauthorized access and use. Do not use e-mail to send us any PII, since it would be unencrypted and can be read by anyone who receives or intercepts it.

If you wish to correct or update the PII related to your AEP account(s), please contact us at the applicable mailing address or telephone number listed here.

AEP reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement at any time by posting revisions on this Website. Such changes will be effective upon posting.
