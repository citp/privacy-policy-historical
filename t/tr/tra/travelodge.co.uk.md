### Marketing

We may periodically send promotional material to you about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting based on the profile we have created about you to the email addresses and phone numbers which you have provided.

If these are similar to products, services and bookings previously supplied by us to you, we will assume, under our legitimate interests to promote similar goods and services, that you are willing to receive this information unless you tell us otherwise. Please note that we do not want to send you information that you do not want to receive and you can opt out at any time (please see **‘The right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing’** below for further information).

We will always ask your permission before sending you email marketing information (unless your company is a member of Travelodge Business or you have already received similar services, products or bookings from us as mentioned above). We do this by asking for your positive confirmation (e.g. by providing a tick or inserting your contact details in the relevant boxes) indicating that you wish to receive marketing and you can opt out at any time (please see **‘The right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing’** below for further information). This ensures you only receive information that you have given us permission to send and are willing to receive. 

If your company is a member of Travelodge Business we will send electronic marketing messages to the email addresses provided by the member company to promote Travelodge Business and related benefits. However you will still have the ability to opt out of these messages in accordance with this policy (see **‘The right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing’** below).

We may use your information to create a profile about you in order to tailor, by automated means, our communication and marketing to you. You can object to such profiling, please see ‘The right to object to automated decision making / profiling’ below).

From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for research purposes and / or to ask about your experience using our hotels and services as part of a continual programme of customer service improvement. We may contact you by email, telephone, text, social media and / or mail. We may also use the information to customise the website according to your interests.

### How long we will keep your personal information

We retain your information for a range of purposes which determine the period of time for which we need to keep such information. For example (list is not exclusive):

**Data** | **Retention** **Period**  
---|---  
Recorded telephone conversations | 7 days from the day of call received  
For the purposes of marketing | 3 years from the point of last contact with you, this may include use of our websites, stays in our hotels or responses to communications with you  
For compliance with legal obligations arising from contracts entered into with you, for example tax regulations | 7 years from date of last transaction |   
  
We will remove your data from our systems at the end of the applicable data retention periods, unless we are required by current or future law to retain your personal information for a longer period.

### Our approach to information security

To protect your information, Travelodge has policies and procedures in place to make sure that only authorised personnel can access the information, that information is handled and stored in a secure and sensible manner and all systems that can access the information have proportionate and reasonable security measures in place. To achieve this, employees, contractors, sub-contractors and third party suppliers have contracts, with defined roles and responsibilities.

While we take commercially reasonable measures to ensure the safety and security of your data, due to the inherent risks with the Internet, we are unable to warranty the absolute security of your data when using our services.

### Transfers of your information out of the EEA

We may from time to time need to transfer your personal information to support partners which are located outside the European Economic Area, for the purpose of ensuring our websites are operating correctly or in relation to third parties to whom we share your data. Any transfer of your data will be subject to adequate levels of protection that will safeguard your privacy rights and give you remedies in the unlikely event of a security breach.

### Your rights

In order to process any of the requests listed below, we may need to verify your identity for your security. In such cases your response will be necessary for you to exercise this right.

**The right to access information we hold about you**  
At any point you can contact us to request details concerning the information we hold about you, why we have that information, who has access to the information and where we got the information. In most cases you may be entitled to copies of the information we hold concerning you. Once we have received your request we will respond within 30 days.

**The right to correct and update the information we hold about you**  
If the data we hold about you is out of date, incomplete or incorrect, you can inform us and we will ensure that it is updated.

**The right to have your information erased**  
If you feel that we should no longer be using your data or that we are illegally using your data, you can request that we erase the data we hold. When we receive your request, we will confirm whether the data has been deleted or tell you the reason why it cannot be deleted.

**The right to object to processing of your data**  
You have the right to request that Travelodge stops processing your data. Upon receiving the request, we will contact you to tell you if we are able to comply or if we have legitimate grounds to continue. If data is no longer processed, we may continue to hold your data to comply with your other rights.

**The right to ask us to stop contacting you with direct marketing**  
You have the right to request that we stop contacting you with direct marketing. On promotional emails we provide an ‘unsubscribe’ link at the bottom of the email which will unsubscribe you from that service.

If you wish to opt out with respect to more than one email address, you must complete a separate request for each email address.

Please note it is not possible to ‘opt-out’ of receiving communication from us which relates to your bookings or customer satisfaction surveys sent as part of the booking (which are not considered marketing for these purposes). This ensures that we can always contact you as a result of circumstances that may affect your stay with us and in order for us to improve our services going forward.

You have the right to request that we transfer your data to another controller. Once we have received your request, we will comply where it is feasible to do so.

### Consent

In those cases where we need your consent to process your information, we will ask you to make a positive indication (e.g. to tick a box or insert your contact details on the relevant form or web page requiring consent). By actively providing us with your consent, you are stating that you have been informed as to the type of personal information that will be processed, the reasons for such processing, how it will be used, for how long it will be kept, who else will have access to it and what your rights are as a data subject and that you have read and understood this privacy policy.

Travelodge is responsible for, and controls the processing of, the personal information provided to us when Member Companies use this website in accordance with this privacy statement.

References to personal information provided by Member Companies in this statement shall include personal information of any of the Member Company's staff members, representatives of the Member Company, or guests staying in our hotels using the Member Company's Travelodge Business membership.
