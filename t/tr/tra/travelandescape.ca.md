# Privacy Policy | Travel and Escape

Blue Ant Media Inc. respects the privacy of all of its users and customers and is committed to protecting such privacy in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This policy explains Blue Ant Media Production Inc.’s and its subsidiaries’ (collectively, “Blue Ant Media Inc.”) treatment of your personally identifiable information collected in connection with your activities on or related to all Blue Ant Media Inc. websites referencing this policy (the “Blue Ant Media Inc. Sites”) and any services made available on the Blue Ant Media Inc. Sites (collectively, unless noted otherwise, the “Blue Ant Media Inc. Services”). We urge you to read this policy carefully and to check back periodically as this policy may change from time to time. Please note that this policy does not apply to the practices of companies or websites which are not owned or controlled by Blue Ant Media Inc. Your access or use of any Blue Ant Media Inc. Site indicates your understanding of, and agreement to be bound by, this policy and the Blue Ant Media Inc. website Terms and Conditions.  
 

### Information Collected

In the course of operating any Blue Ant Media Inc. Services, we may collect two types of information about our users and customers: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. “Personal Information” is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, birth date and gender. Personal Information is collected by us when you choose to provide it to us when registering for a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service, such as when you choose to subscribe to a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service or enter a Blue Ant Media Inc. promotion. In addition, if you choose to contact a customer service representative of ours, we may keep a record of that correspondence so that we may fully address the subject matter. We may also receive Personal Information from our business partners and other third parties, provided that such third parties confirm to us that you have permitted them to share such information. Business contact information such as the name, title, business address, email address or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information. “Non-Personal Information” is information of an anonymous nature, such as your Internet Protocol Address, the domain you may have used to access a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service, the type and version of browser or operating system you may be using, and the website you may have come from and visit next. Aggregate information, such as the demographic statistics of our users and customers (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors and average time spent on a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service, is also considered Non-Personal Information. Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service. For example, our web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information which is provided through your browser or stored on a Cookie or through a Web Beacon when you choose to visit a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service.

### Use of Personal Information

Personal Information may be used by us for the following purposes;

a) Providing you with a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service and information you have requested from us, including your use of a Blue Ant Media Inc. Site. We may from time to time use your Personal Information to contact you about changes, enhancements or similar notices related to a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service;

b) If you indicated that you were interested in receiving offers or information from us or certain of our selected sponsors or advertisers, we may send you email materials and other mailings about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. If at any time you would like to end your subscription to any such email materials, follow the directions posted at the bottom of the email material;

c) If you enter a contest or other promotion offered on a Blue Ant Media Inc. Site, we may, under the rules of the promotion, use your name and certain other information to administer the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the promotion; and

d) We may also use Personal Information if we have reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful when investigating a contravention of a federal, provincial, foreign or other law or in order to protect or defend a legal interest.

### Disclosure of Personal Information

We will not sell or rent your Personal Information to any third party.

We will only disclose your Personal Information to third parties:

a) Where you have specifically given us your consent to disclose your Personal Information for a designated purpose;

b) Who are acting on our behalf as our agents, suppliers or service providers, solely to enable us to more efficiently provide you with a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service. Such entities act under strict contractual controls, requiring them to maintain the confidentiality of all such Personal Information and to use such information solely for purposes related to the provision of the Blue Ant Media Inc. Services;

c) As may be set out in the Terms and Conditions applicable to Blue Ant Media Inc. Service to facilitate the provision of such service, such as fulfilling legal requirements;

d) As required by law, including by an order of any court, institution or body with jurisdiction or authority to compel the production of information, or in order to protect or defend a legal interest; or

e) In connection with a Blue Ant Media Inc. corporate re-organization, merger, amalgamation or similar transaction with another entity, or a sale of all or a substantial portion of the assets of Blue Ant Media Inc., provided that the Personal Information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this policy by the entity acquiring the information.

### Links to Other Sites and Advertisements

A Blue Ant Media Inc. Service may contain links to other websites and services. While we try to link only to sites and services that share our high standards and respect for privacy, please understand that we are not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This policy applies only to the Blue Ant Media Inc. Services referencing this policy.

### Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We take technical, contractual, administrative and physical security steps to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. We instruct our employees with access to your Personal Information that it is to be used only in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. In certain areas, such as when you provide credit card information to us, we work to help protect the security of your credit card information during transmission by using industry standard encryption technology.

You can help protect the security of your Personal Information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access your Account or Registration Information. Also, remember to log out of your account and close your browser window when you finish using a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service or surfing the Web, so that other people using the same computer will not have access to your information.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may from time to time change this Privacy Policy. Changes will be effective when posted at a Blue Ant Media Inc. Site. Please check this Privacy Policy regularly for updates.

### Additional Privacy Procedures

Privacy procedures specific to a Blue Ant Media Inc. Service can be found on a Blue Ant Media Inc. Site at the location of the particular Blue Ant Media Inc. Service, or in additional terms referenced at such site. Those procedures are an addendum to this policy.
