## **What IP Address Information is Collected and How is It Used?**

An IP address is the unique number that is assigned to every direct Internet access point.

Each such request is logged by our computers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page and is stored by our computers as needed for the purposes described in this policy.

We may use your IP address to display more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and advertising based on your geographic area.
