# Privacy Policy | Travel and Escape

### GlassBOX Online Privacy Statement

Look, we use the internet too — a lot — and there’s nothing we hate more than idiots collecting our personal information and spamming us with a bunch of crap we don’t want. We promise we won’t do that to you.

### 1\. What Personal Information is Collected From You

When GlassBOX collects personally identifiable information from you it’s always for a good reason, such as a contest or to provide you with requested notifications or information. Any time we ask you to provide your information to us, we’ll always tell you why and what for. All services of this kind are always opt-in, so you never have to worry about sneaky checkboxes.

### 2\. How Your Personal Information Is Used

Any information you provide will be kept confidential and only used for the purposes we explicitly say it’s for. Information regarding you will only be kept for as long as is required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and then zorched into the ether for all time.

### 3\. With Whom Your Information Is Shared

In very limited circumstances, we use outside parties to administer contests, promotions and other online activities on our behalf. This may involve the collection of personal information. We always ensure that the way any outside party collects and retains personal information conforms to our privacy regime. There may also be instances in which we are required by law to provide personal information without your consent. Such instances include emergency situations, or where otherwise required by law.

Other than as indicated above, we will not sell, rent, share or otherwise make available your personal information to any outside parties without your consent.

### 4\. Collection and Use of Non-personal Information

Like every site on the web, we compile anonymous information on our visitors. This is collected for statistical purposes only, and can in no way be traced back to you as an individual. One day we’ll use this aggregate information to improve the site, but for now it’s just to satiate our own gnawing curiosity about what sorts of things you people are interested in doing here.

### 5\. Links and Forums

GlassBOX sites contain links to some other sites. While we think they’re good sites (otherwise we wouldn’t link to them), we are not responsible in any way for the privacy practices on these sites so, you know, user beware.

As for comments posted in the Blog, we beg you to use some common sense in protecting yourself. Remember that it’s a public forum, which means any member of the public can see it, and it goes without saying that the public is not to be trusted. So don’t go posting anything there that someone could use in bad ways against you, okay? Just don’t.

Generally, we remind you that the Internet is not a secure medium. The nature of Internet communications means that your communications may be susceptible to data corruption, interception and delays. As such and despite our best efforts, your privacy cannot always be guaranteed when you communicate online or otherwise visit any website.
