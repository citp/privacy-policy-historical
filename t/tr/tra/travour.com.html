<br>
7. How much protected is my personal financial information?<br>
<br>
To keep your personal financial information private is vital and important to us. As with all personal information, Travour.com will never rent or sell your personal financial information. Your use of certain services or features, known to us, may help us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements.

<br>
Please note that there may be places on the Travour.com network of Web sites where you can transmit credit card information in order to complete a purchase transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted format. We use best industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption technology. This sophisticated encryption process ensures that prying eyes are unable to decode your personal data when it travels from your computer to ours. <br>
<br>
8. What security precautions are there to place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information? <br>
<br>
It may not be a norm but the fact remains that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure always. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Travour.com cannot ensure or warrant the total security of any information you transmit to us or for our online products purchase or services, and you do so at your own risk. But once we receive your transmission, we strive and make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. <br>
<br>
9. What else should I know about my privacy?<br>
<br>
Do keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, on mailing lists or in chat areas - that information can be seen and collected and used by others. In nutshell, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the other public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. <br>
<br>
Finally, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any registration information. Please be careful and responsible on your own whenever you're online. <br>
<br>
10. Is there any children's privacy? <br>
<br>
Yes, the safety of children is very important to us. Children should always ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to Compare Infobase Pvt. Ltd, or to anyone online for that matter. Travour.com does not share personal information about users under the age of 13 with third parties under any circumstances unless there is a special situation and such information is requested by law enforcing agency and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users, regardless of their age. In addition, Travour.com will not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of 14 without first obtaining their parents' permission.<br>
