The information you supply will be used by RTC to respond to your inquiries or supply you with information about us. Authorized third parties may be used by RTC to collect, track and process such information.

### **Internet Protocol Address**

We collect an IP address from all visitors to our site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our site, analyze trends, track users’ movements, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site and deliver customized content. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

### **Use of "Cookies"**

Our site may use cookies to enhance your experience. Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to the computer browsing that website, and are used for record-keeping purposes at many websites. Use of cookies makes Web-surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords and your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular website and making sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Many consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard.

Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not function properly when you view them.

### **Security**

All information provided to RTC is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of RTC. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100 percent secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

### **Tell-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. RTC will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. RTC stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

### **Other Websites**

Our site contains links to other websites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another website for which RTC has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such sites, as their policies may be different than ours.

### **Contacting the Website**
