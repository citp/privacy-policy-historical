# Transferr - Privacy Policy -

TRANSFERR PRIVACY POLICY, UPDATED  01/01/2010. Expires 01/12/2015.  

Transferr is committed to providing our users with a seamless and comfortable experience with the site. For this reason we are serious about your Privacy and the safety of your personal information, preferences and links that you provide in order for the site to operate. This Privacy Policy outlines the ways in which we deal with your information and our policy regarding its management. This policy also advises users about their interaction and safety regarding personal activity online. If you wish to contact us about what information we have collected on you, please [email us](mailto:support@transferr.com) and we'll be more than happy to assist. 

**Information Collected by Transferr:**

**1.** Provided Information: Transferr requires users give certain personal information in order to take advantage of continuing support and information. This information is stored by Transferr in a private and secure environment. 

1.1 Registration: Users who register with Transferr are required to give a username and password and their email address. This is to improve security and to help us contact you in the event of an issue with service or to inform you of changes to the site that could affect your usage of the site. Transferr recommends that users create usernames that are not entirely descriptive, i.e. if your name is 'John Smith' we don't recommend a username like 'johnsmith', as this could lead to others inferring that your name is 'John Smith'. Please choose passwords carefully. For maximum security, numbers, letters and punctuation marks are recommended to be used. Do not use the name of pets, loved ones or anything easily guessable. Transferr takes your Privacy and Identity Theft seriously, if you are concerned that someone has discovered your password, ensure you change it, or close your account with us. 

 1.2 Icons and Links: Users of Transferr will submit links they wish to quickly access, which will generate icons. Transferr will store this information in order to allow users to save changes to their links. Transferr neither views nor shares this information with any person, company or group.
