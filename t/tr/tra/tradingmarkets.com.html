  PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT</span></center><br>
  TradingMarkets is committed to protecting the private sensitive information 
  of our customers. We have revised our Privacy Policy to reflect our commitment, 
  and we strongly urge our customers to take some time to review the new version 
  below.   
  </div>
 
<p><strong><u>Information Collection</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Registration and Billing</strong><br>
  In order to use some of our services, we ask our customers to give us contact 
  information (name, address and phone number). We use this information to contact 
  customers about services or products that may interest them. We also ask our 
  customers to give us their e-mail addresses and credit card information for 
  certain services. We DO NOT distribute e-mail addresses or phone numbers outside 
  of TradingMarkets, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and strategic business 
  partners. We DO NOT disclose credit card information to any entity other than 
  credit card processing companies that assist us in billing customers for goods 
  and services.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information 
  about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable 
  information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent 
  cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie 
  simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's 
  hard drive for an extended period of time. Users can set up their web browser 
  to inform them when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set. If 
  users reject cookies, they may still use our website, but will be limited in 
  using some areas of our website.</p>
<p>We use cookies to store our customers user name and password 
  so that they do not have to input these items every time they visit our website. 
  We also use cookies to track our customers' preferences, such as services or 
  products previously purchased, so that we can provide a better customized service 
  when our customers return to our website. See the Profile section.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
  Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet 
  protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit 
  pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, 
  administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad 
  demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked 
  to our customers' contact or Sensitive Information. </p>
<p><strong><u>Information Use</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Profile</strong><br>
  We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, 
  and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information 
  that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, 
  collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information 
  to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile 
  is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing 
  promotions to them. </p>
<p><strong>Information Use</strong><br>
  We provide information about trading. Since our customers often have widely 
  differing uses for our products and services, our strongly held belief and experience 
  is that the more we know about our customers, the more value we can offer them. 
  We use the information our customers provide during registration to offer them 
  personalized collection, filtering, and delivery of information (such as strategies 
  and articles) that is of the greatest interest and value to them. </p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br>
  The ads appearing on our website are delivered to our customers by our Web advertising 
  partners. Information about our customers' visit to this site, such as number 
  of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address or other contact 
  information), is used to serve ads to users on our website. </p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by TradingMarkets 
  only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Communications from the Site</u></strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Special Offers and Updates</strong><br>
  We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. 
  Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services 
  and special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the 
  option to not receive these types of communications in these e-mails. </p>
<p><strong>Newsletters</strong><br>
  If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters, we ask for contact information 
  such as name and e-mail address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide 
  a way to opt-out of these communications. </p>
<p><strong>Service Announcements</strong><br>
  On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. 
  For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might 
  send users an e-mail. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, 
  though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are 
  not promotional in nature. </p>
<p><strong>Customer Service</strong><br>
  We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and 
  in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via e-mail or phone, 
  in accordance with the users wishes.</p>
<p><strong><u>Sharing</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>
  Though we make every effort to preserve customer privacy, we may need to disclose 
  personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief 
  that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, 
  a court order or legal process served on our website.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing With Third Parties</strong><br>
  We do NOT share our customers' e-mail addresses with third parties, except for 
  when required by law (see legal disclaimer). In order to present our customers 
  with potentially interesting opportunities, we do occasionally share name and 
  mailing address information with certain third parties. We believe that our 
  customers will benefit from these arrangements, but out of respect of our clients' 
  privacy, we will remove such information from disclosure upon request (via e-mail 
  to support@tradingmarkets.com) by our customers. </p>
<p><strong>Third Party Intermediaries</strong><br>
  We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing 
  company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, 
  share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>
  Our customers are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information 
  used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask 
  for information. Customers who no longer wish to receive our newsletters and 
  promotional communications via e-mail may opt-out of receiving these communications 
  by clicking on the link provided in the e-mail or by sending us an e-mail us 
  at support@tradingmarkets.com. </p>
<p><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong><br>
  If a customer elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about 
  our site or forwards a TradingMarkets' commentary to a friend, we ask for the 
  friend's name and e-mail address. TradingMarkets may send the friend a one-time 
  e-mail inviting them to visit the site. TradingMarkets stores this information 
  for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail and tracking the success 
  of our referral program. The friend may contact TradingMarkets at support@tradingmarkets.com 
  to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
  We take every precaution to protect our customers' information. When customers 
  submit sensitive information via our website, their information is protected 
  both online and off-line.</p>
<p>When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information 
  (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected 
  with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, 
  such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as 
  Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed 
  to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. </p>
<p>We also do everything in our power to protect user-information 
  off-line. We restrict all of our customers' information to our offices, and 
  only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, 
  our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to 
  personally identifiable information. Our employees must use passwords to access 
  the information and are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. 
  Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept 
  in a secure environment.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, 
  please contact us via e-mail at to support@tradingmarkets.com.</p>
<p><strong>Supplementation of Information </strong><br>
  To fulfill our obligation to our customers, it is sometimes necessary that we 
  supplement the information that we receive with information from third party 
  sources.</p>
<p><strong>Address Verification</strong><br>
  We use RTWare software to verify a customer's address before completing a charge 
  on a credit card. This procedure protects our customers and us from credit card 
  fraud and other illegal activities. </p>
<p><strong>Purchasing History</strong><br>
  In order for this Web site to enhance its ability to tailor the site to a user's 
  preference, we combine information about a customer's purchasing habits to create 
  a personalized customer profile. </p>
<p><strong>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</strong><br>
  If a customer's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, 
  phone, e-mail or mailing address), or if a customer no longer desires our service, 
  we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate the customer's personally 
  identifiable information. This can usually be done at the member information 
  page, by e-mailing our Customer Support at support@tradingmarkets.com or by 
  contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed 
  below.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this 
  privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our 
  customers are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and 
  under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. </p>
<p><strong>Contact Information</strong><br>
  If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please 
  contact us at:</p>
