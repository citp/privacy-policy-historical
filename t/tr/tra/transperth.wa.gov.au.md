## Social Media Public Policy (House Rules)

**Policy Overview**

Transperth recognises social media channels as convenient for both passengers and non-passengers to obtain news, promotions, and other information directly relevant to transport in WA.

Official Public House Rules have been developed for all members of the public who comment on, or interact with, any of the Transperth online properties. They are outlined here to ensure high quality participation, in a manner that does not infringe the rights of, or restrict the use and enjoyment of the channel, by any other person.

**House Rules**

While Transperth supports open-dialogue, when interacting with our online media, you agree to:

  * Participate with the intention of adding value to, or benefitting the experience of, using public transport. If it helps you and other users of Transperth to navigate the service; if it helps our employees or partners do their jobs and solve problems; if it contributes directly or indirectly to improving Transperth’s services; if it builds a sense of community, then it is adding value
  * Aim to be fair, truthful and accurate
  * Take issue with the opinion, not the person
  * Be respective of other people's reputations
  * Be gentle when pointing out someone else's error or misinterpretation
  * Don't spam others - it makes it hard to have a real conversation
  * Remember that social updates from Transperth are written by Transperth staff



**Things to avoid**

  * Don’t use language containing expletives or hate speech
  * Avoid writing anything racist, discriminatory, offensive, abusive, threatening, harassing, false, misleading, defamatory, or unlawful
  * Don't use copyrighted material without the owner's permission
  * Don't use Transperth online properties for self-promotion or commercial gain



Transperth has the right to remove any post seen as breaking the House Rules, as well as the right to report or block any user from which we receive a pattern of rule-breaking activity.

**Comment moderation**

All Transperth online properties are actively monitored during normal business hours (see individual account properties for details). However, we do not have the capacity to monitor our accounts 24 hours per day, nor respond to each individual user. We will join the conversation where reasonable, when capacity allows.

Our team reads all direct messages and public online commentary, and any recurring themes or helpful feedback are passed to the relevant people internally.

If journey-specific or live service information is required, users are instructed to visit the Transperth website at www.transperth.wa.gov.au.

For urgent enquiries call the Transperth InfoLine on 13 62 13.

**Following**

If you follow us on an online platform we will not automatically follow you back. However, being followed by Transperth does not imply endorsement of any kind.

**Content sharing**

All content produced by Transperth on online properties, is protected by copyright. However, you are encouraged to share our content provided that you credit us as the source (by including our official social media handle for the platform you are sharing on, see individual channels for details) and do not change the sense or misrepresent us.

**For a formal response**

Transperth social media channels are informal. If you'd like a formal response from us, please complete the feedback form on our website.
