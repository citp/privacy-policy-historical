			    <p></p>
    			
			    <h3>Use and Retention of Personal Information</h3>
			    <p>
					We use personal information only for the purpose for which we tell you that it has been collected, and for other legitimate purposes as permitted by the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”) and other relevant laws, and retain it only as long as necessary for those uses.

We may make use of the personal information we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.</p>
    			
			    <h3>Maintenance of Accurate Information</h3>

Your order is placed over a secure connection and your personal information is encrypted to ensure your data remains safe at all times.</p>
    			
			    <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</h3>
