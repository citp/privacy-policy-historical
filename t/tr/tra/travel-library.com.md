# Rec.Travel Library

The Rec.Travel Library was founded to help individuals share travel information and stories with each other, and believes in the rights of individuals to liberty and to privacy on the Internet. We do not track any personal or individual information about any visitor to this web site, and we do not engage in spamming. 

**Information Automatically Logged**

Certain information about web server traffic is automatically logged by all web servers. This information includes your IP address, the page you requested, the time of the connection, the type of web browser you use, and the address of the page containing the link that sent you here. We use this information in aggregate to find the total number of visitors to each page of the web site, to determine what web sites bring visitors here, and to help identify errors such as broken links within our web site. 

**Burst! Media**

We use an advertising agency, Burst! Media, to display advertisements on our site. Some of these ads may contain cookies and may collect certain kinds of personal information. We also host a demographic survey which invites visitors to voluntarily provide general demographic information which is not linked to personal identification. Information from both sources is used in aggregate in connection with selling banner advertising on the web site. Burst! Media have published a [privacy statement](http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp) describing how they use the information that they collect. The Rec.Travel Library has no access to the information that Burst! obtains through its banners, and has access only to overall summaries of the demographic survey information. 

**Mailing lists**

We operate a mailing list used to make announcements about the Library. The list is opt-in only; we do not place people's addresses on the list without their consent. The list services are provided by a reputable list service provider, and include easy-to-use subscription and unsubscription procedures. We do not release our mailing list to any other organizations or individuals.

This site contains many links to other sites. We have no knowledge of or responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
