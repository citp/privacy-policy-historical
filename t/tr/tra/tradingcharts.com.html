    <dt><b>The information we collect ...</b></dt>
    <dd>Our software automatically collects limited information about each visit to our web sites. This information is limited to the time and date, the IP address, the type of web browser software used, the address of the web page visited on our site, and the address of the web page from which provided the link to our site. In addition, our software automatically records the "alias" you used if you log on to our chat room. We do not record any other personal information provided through our web site in any way. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><b>Why we do it ...</b><br>
    </dt>
    <dd>The information collected is used for the improvement of our services only. The information is saved in "raw" form for a period of approximately thirty days, in the form of "log files. These files might occasionally be examined to diagnose problems with our server, or to provide an IP address used to access our site in the case of abuse or "hacking". In no case is log file information made available to outside agencies, except in a limited matter only if required by law enforcement agencies or others involved in solving crime or online abuse. After approximately 30 days, the information is compiled into aggregate form. The original log files are then discarded; information regarding specific visits is permanently erased. The aggregate statistics are used for the purpose of providing long-term general usage statistics. Occasionally, these aggregate statistics are made available to potential advertisers so that they can evaluate the usefulness of supporting our sites. </dd>

    <dt><b>About e-mail addresses ...</b>

    <dd>When you e-mail us, or use our "Suggestion Box" pages to contact us, your message and email address might be saved on our office computers, but only for the purpose of ongoing correspondence. The email addresses you provide to us in any manner are never compiled into a mailing list, nor provided to third parties. Be aware though, that if you post messages to our online <a href="http://futures.tradingcharts.com/forum/">discussion forums</a> and provide your email address in the messages, that information is visible to other visitors, and could be abused by unscrupulous visitors and corporations.

This information is collected in aggregate statistics only. Our software has no provision to discover the identity of anyone completing the survey.

In addition, the aggregate statistics may occasionally be shared with our advertisers to help them appraise the usefulness of advertising on our sites.</dd>
