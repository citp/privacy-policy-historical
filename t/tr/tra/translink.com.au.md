# Privacy | translink.com.au

TransLink, a division of the Department of Transport and Main Roads is committed to protecting your privacy. TransLink abides by the [Information Privacy Act 2009 (IP Act)](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/act-2009-014) which regulates the way in which Queensland government agencies must manage personal information. It addresses concerns about any unauthorised use of this information and gives individuals a right of access to personal information held about them.

## Online services

Where relevant, the department may record information about your use of this website or MyTransLink app for statistical purposes and to improve your digital experience. We use Google Analytics to gather anonymous information about how customers use our websites and apps.

Unless you provide your personal information as part of the online service, no attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may request inspection of the activity logs, through appropriate legal processes.

## Accessing information

You must not use any application, system or method to access information on this website, including information in relation to _go_ card accounts, other than through ordinary use of this website by methods purposely made available on this website. You must not provide to any person or invite or solicit any third party to provide you with, passwords or other information to enable such access.

## Email and SMS

We will not use your personal contact details you provide such as email address, SMS device number or phone number other than for the purpose for which you provided it. Where assistance is requested, your enquiry will be forwarded to the relevant departmental officer and/or our contactor and business partner.

If you have received communication from TransLink and no longer wish to receive updates from us, you can unsubscribe via:

  * clicking the “unsubscribe” link in any TransLink email you have received

## Mobile applications

To help improve the app and TransLink services more generally, TransLink may, from time-to-time, record information about your use of the app. This information may include:

  * when and how the app is used
  * the pages accessed and the types of functions used
  * your location when using a map, stop alarm or 'stops near you' feature, and
  * your device type and information required in order to deliver push notifications to you, when enabled.



TransLink (and its contractors) may use the information recorded about your use of the app to contact you and invite you to participate in surveys and to otherwise improve the app and TransLink services more generally.

By downloading the TransLink app and 'enabling' each push notification function in the app settings on your device, you consent to TransLink delivering push notifications to your device to:

  * notify you of current or upcoming journey or route disruptions; and
  * invite you to participate in TransLink customer surveys.



If you do not wish to receive either or both types of push notifications from TransLink, you may disable either or both types of push notification functions in the app settings on your device.

Unless otherwise stated in these conditions of use, no attempt will be made to identify users or users' activities, unless TransLink is required by law to do so.

## Smart cards 

Our use of your personal information will depend on whether you are a 'registered' smart card holder or whether you have an 'unregistered' smart card.

A Smart Card is a valid form of electronic ticket used for travel on the TransLink SEQ network such as a _go_ card or _go explore_ card.

For any _go_ card enquiries, please contact [informationrequests@translink.com.au](mailto:informationrequests@translink.com.au).

Your personal information may be used to facilitate smart card services including:

  * top ups
  * fare adjustments
  * refunds
  * balance transfers
