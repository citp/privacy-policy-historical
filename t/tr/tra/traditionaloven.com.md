In fact you can bake for 4 to 6 hours reloading batches in the oven (including slow long time roasting at baking temperatures.) My favorites are whole mixed grains breads, Sour Dough and Turkish breads, sweets of course. It's a good idea to own a proper book about baking strategies, I ordered this one from eBay and I'm enjoying reading it ever since:

[ To order this book click here](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=3&campid=5335809901&toolid=10001&customid=bakerapprentice&ext=baker%27s+apprentice&satitle=baker%27s+apprentice)  
Great as present, or must have DIY Book by Peter Reinhart: "The Bread Baker's Apprentice".
