                <p> If you register to use Tradesparq we collect and store information that specifically identifies you or your account ("Personally Identifiable Information"). At this time, the most information you would be required to submit is information about whether you are a "buyer", "seller", or "service provider", your name, password, and email address. Persons wishing to pay for banner advertisements or preferred search listings are also required to enter a valid credit card number and name as it appears on the credit card or other information such as bank routing and account numbers to facilitate ACH payments. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you, to help us to tailor the site for you and deliver personalized information to you. We may supplement our information with additional information purchased from third parties for marketing purposes. Credit card information and any bank information will be transmitted via SSL encryption for your protection. </p>

Similarly, we may offer contests to qualifying Users in which we ask for contact and demographic information such as name, email address and mailing address. None of this information is shared with third parties, except in summary form, if at all. The demographic information that Tradesparq collects in the registration process and through online surveys is used to help us improve the Tradesparq site to meet the needs and preferences of our Users.
