Your continued use of the TI Website will be on the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.

Our web servers collect anonymous data about visits to the TI Website. This information is stored in log files and is sometimes used to create aggregate statistics about when the TI Website is accessed, which pages refer visitors to us, the type of web browsers visitors use, which pages are viewed, etc. These statistics help us understand how the TI Website is used and provide us with valuable information for improving it for you in the future.

Personal information you submit to TI is kept confidential, is stored securely, and is retained only for as long as it is required for the purpose for which it was given. Personal information you provide will not be sold or rented or made public. Personal information is never shared with third parties unless we have your permission or are required to disclose the information by law, with the exception of the following circumstances:

  * _Payment processing and fraud_ : If you make an online purchase or donation, your card details will be disclosed to a bank so that payment can be processed. In the case of a suspected fraudulent transaction, these details may be disclosed to the appropriate authorities for the sole purpose of investigation.
  * _Hosting and processing_ : the TI Website is hosted by a third party service provider. We may also use third parties to process donations to TI. These third party services providers will process your personal information only on TI’s behalf and are bound by strict confidentiality conditions.



Processing of your information by TI and its service providers is regulated by German data privacy law and protected by appropriate security measures.
