<p>The nature of our business requires a relationship of trust with our customers. The foundation of that trust is the assurance that we will not misuse information that we receive about customers. The following is our Privacy Policy regarding the collection and disclosure of our customers’ personal information. The Privacy Policy is subject to updates at any time. The Travelers companies operate in a number of different jurisdictions and this Privacy Policy is not a comprehensive statement of all measures taken and rules complied with in each of those jurisdictions, but an indication of the intent of The Travelers to comply with the privacy laws of the jurisdictions where we do business.</p>

<p><b>WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT "PRIVACY"</b><br>
Your privacy is important to us. When we sell an insurance policy to a person we need information about the person or property that we're insuring. We consider this private and have taken steps to keep it confidential.</p>
<p>We want you to know about our privacy policy. The privacy policy tells you the kinds of information we get about you, where we get it, and with whom, if anyone, we may share it.</p>
<p>This brochure describes our privacy policy, procedures and practices for individuals who seek or get auto, home and other personal liability and property insurance for personal, family or household needs.</p>

<p><b>WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WE HAVE AND WHERE WE GET IT</b><br>
You give us most of what we need in the application process. To make sure what we have is correct we may need to check with you by phone or mail.</p>
<p>You may be asked to give us more details in writing or over the phone. Plus, we may receive and check your past insurance claims from insurance support organizations or your former insurers.</p>
<p>As allowed by law, we may ask for credit and other consumer reports from consumer reporting agencies concerning your application for insurance or any renewal of insurance. Information given to us by an insurance support organization, including consumer reporting agencies may be retained by them and disclosed to other persons.</p>
<p>For auto insurance, we often get a report of accidents or convictions from your State Motor Vehicle Department. We get these reports through an independent reporting company. We may also check information from government agencies or independent reporting companies. This helps us correctly rate and price your policy.</p>
<p>For home, building, or boat insurance, we or an inspector from an independent company may visit the property to inspect and report on its condition. In some cases, pictures may be taken. This allows us to check the estimate we have of your property's value. If we need more details about the property or the alarm you've installed, we may need to enter your property to finish the inspection. We would contact you before entering your property.</p>
<p>As a part of our application and underwriting process, in most states, we also order an Insurance Score based on credit history. We use the Score, information you give us, and other consumer reports for underwriting and the price we will charge. If we receive corrected personal information from a consumer reporting agency, we will re-evaluate you.</p>
<p>Once you're insured with us, your file may contain details about your policy(ies). This may include bill payments or claim history. A claim representative may comment, for example, on the condition and use of the insured property. We may also keep a police report if one was issued.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to know about your health. For example, if we need to know whether a physical limitation will affect your ability to drive, we would ask you to sign a form allowing your personal doctor to answer any question we may have.</p>

<p><b>WHO HAS ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION</b><br>
We keep what we collect about you in our files. Our policies and procedures protect your personal information. We have physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in place.</p>
<p><b>We do not give or sell our customers' personal information to others for marketing purposes. You don't have to ask us to keep your information private because we do not give it, unless allowed.</b></p>
<p>We will use information about you to sell you insurance, service your insurance and settle claims. We may give the information to other persons or companies to help us manage or service our business. When we do, we require them to use it only for the reasons we gave it to them.</p>
<p>We may give, without your past permission and only if allowed by law, information about you held in our files to certain persons or organizations <u>such as</u>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your agent or broker</li>
	<li>Our affiliated property and casualty insurance companies</li>
	<li>An independent claim adjuster or investigator</li>
	<li>Persons or organizations that conduct scientific research, including actuarial or underwriting studies, provided that no individual may be identified in the studies</li>
	<li>An insurance support organization, including consumer reporting agencies</li>
	<li>Another insurer in order to prevent or prosecute fraud</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, on rare occasions, we may be required to share this information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>With a State Insurance Department or other governmental agency, if required by federal, state or local laws</li>
	<li>If ordered by a summons, court order, search warrant or subpoena</li>
	<li>To protect our own legal interests, or in case of suspected fraud or other illegal activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>HOW TO FIND OUT WHAT INFORMATION WE HAVE ABOUT YOU</b><br>
If you have any questions about what we have in your file please write to us. When we receive your written request, we will respond within thirty (30) business days. We will let you know if we've given any information about you to anyone in the past. If we asked for a consumer report we will tell you the name and address of the consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p>You may also see and copy your file (except for certain documents about claims and lawsuits). If you believe any of our information is wrong we'll check it out and if we agree there was an error, we'll correct it. If we don't agree, you're still allowed to file a letter with your comments. We'll send the correction or letter to anyone who received or will receive the original information.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the right of access to or correction of your file, we'll be happy to review our procedures with you. Please contact:<br>

your agent or insurance representative<br>
or<br>
Personal Lines Privacy Coordinator<br>
