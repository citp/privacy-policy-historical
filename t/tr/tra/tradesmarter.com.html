</ul>

<p>You have a right to access your personal information, subject to certain exceptions allowed by law.

Access to the requested personal information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing you with copies;</li>
<li>providing you with the opportunity for inspection; or</li>
<li>providing you with a summary.</li>
</ul>
<p>If charges are applicable in providing access to you, we will disclose these charges to you prior to providing you with the information.</p>
<p>Some exceptions exist where we will not provide you with access to your personal information if:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing access would pose a serious threat to the life or health of a person;</li>
<li>providing access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others;</li>
<li>the request for access is frivolous or vexatious;</li>
<li>the information is related to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between us and would not be discoverable in those proceedings;</li>
<li>providing access would reveal our intentions in relation to negotiations with you in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations;</li>
<li>providing access would be unlawful;</li>
<li>denying access is required or authorised by or under law;</li>
<li>providing access would be likely to prejudice certain operations by or on behalf of an enforcement body or an enforcement body requests that access not be provided on the grounds of national security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we refuse you access to your personal information, we will provide you with a written explanation for that refusal.</p>
<p><strong>Using Government Identifiers</strong></p>
<p>Although in certain circumstances we are required to collect government identifiers such as your tax file number, Medicare number or pension card number, we do not use or disclose this information other than when required or authorised by law or unless you have voluntarily consented to disclose this information to any third party.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with us anonymously</strong></p>
<p>You can deal with us anonymously where it is lawful and practicable to do so. For example, if you telephone requesting our postal address.</p>
<p><strong>Your sensitive information</strong></p>
<p>Without your consent we will not collect information about you that reveals your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliations, membership of professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, details of health, disability, sexual orientation, or criminal record.</p>
<p>This is subject to some exceptions including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the collection is required by law; and</li>
<li>when the information is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Complaints Resolutions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our Website</strong></p>
<p>Our Website utilises cookies to provide you with a better user experience. Cookies also allow us to identify your browser while you are using our site – they do not identify you. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can instruct your web browser to refuse them.</p>
<p><strong>Spam Act</strong></p>
<p>Spam is a generic term used to describe electronic ‘junk mail’- unwanted messages sent to a person’s email account or mobile phone. In Australia, spam is defined as unsolicited commercial electronic messages, such as emails, instant messaging, SMS and other mobile phone messaging. It excludes normal voice-to-voice communication by telephone.</p>
<p>Market Punter Pty Ltd complies with the provisions of the Spam Act when sending commercial electronic messages.</p>
<p>Equally importantly, Market Punter Pty Ltd makes sure that our practices are in accordance with the National Privacy Principles in all activities where they deal with personal information. Personal information includes our clients contact details.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Procedure for dealing with complaints</strong></p>
<p>The three key steps Market Punter Pty Ltd follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consent – Only commercial electronic messages are sent with the addressee’s consent – either express or inferred consent.</li>
<li>Identify – Electronic messages will include clear and accurate information about the person and that Market Punter Pty Ltd is responsible for sending the commercial electronic message.</li>
<li>Unsubscribe – We ensure that a functional unsubscribe facility is included in all our commercial electronic messages and deal with unsubscribe requests promptly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consented to such communications</strong></p>
<p>Commercial messages will only be sent to you when you have given consent. This may be express consent – a direct indication that it is okay to send the message, or messages of that nature or inferred consent based on our business or other relationship with you and your conduct.</p>
<p><strong>Comply with the law regarding viral messages</strong></p>
<p>Market Punter Pty Ltd ensures that Commercial Communications that include a Forwarding Facility contain a clear recommendation that the Recipient should only forward the Commercial Communication to persons with whom they have a relationship, where that relationship means that person could be said to have Consented to receiving Commercial Communications.</p>

            Binary options – also known as "digital options" or "all-or-nothing options" – are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the option expires. As the name implies, binary options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple "Yes or No" approach. For example, will the AUD/USD finish above the current price at the end of the hour? If "Yes," the binary option settles "in-the-money"; if "No," the binary option settles "out-of-the-money". Like traditional options, binary options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, stocks or commodities. But unlike a contract for difference (CFD) or spread bet, a binary option does not require margins or stops and you know exactly how much you stand to gain or lose from the outset. Binary options are simple, and they are ideal for the trader who wants the potential for significant, short-term gains with strictly limited risk.<br><br>Trading binary options involves risk and may not be suitable for everyone. Only speculate with money you can afford to lose. You can earn 60-85% per in-the-money option or lose up to your investment out-of-the-money trade.

Therefore, you should consider the information in light of your objectives, financial situation or needs before making any decision about whether to acquire the binary options, which are derivatives.        </span>
