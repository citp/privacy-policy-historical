                            below are applicable to the above-named online service (the "Service") produced and maintained by Trail's End Company. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">TEC-IT collects personally identifying information only during (i) contest or 
                            sweepstakes Registration and (ii) user Registration for sites that require subscription and (iii) online shopping. . In addition, Registration is required and information is collected in certain portions of the Service 
                            in which guests specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or voting. TEC-IT may use such information to fulfill 
                            prizes, track compliance with our House Rules, or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event TEC-IT plans to publicly post any such 
                            information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and given the option of preventing such posting. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">TEC-IT encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to 
                            participate in the interactive activities offered on the site. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">No information should be submitted to or posted to public areas at Trails-End.com by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or 
                            guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, TEC-IT does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any other third party than the BSA for any purpose whatsoever. All 
                            registrants receive e-mail confirming their Registration. In addition, when a guest under 13 registers, his/her parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that Registration and providing instructions on how 
                            the parent could delete the Registration if so desired.&nbsp; No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purpose whatsoever outside TEC-IT. Guests' e-mail 
                            addresses are never publicly posted on TEC-IT sites. To facilitate global registration within sites operated by TEC-IT, all Registration information is shared. It is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and

                            of system administration and to report aggregate information. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers - the big computers that 
                            "serve" up Web pages - automatically identify your computer by its IP address. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">When guests request pages from TEC-IT sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything 
                            personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. </font></p><p align="LEFT"><b><font size="+1" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Use of Cookies&nbsp; </font>
                            </b></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing 
                            easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an Industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">By showing how and when 
                            guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most 
                            easily tracked with cookies. If you accept the first tracking cookie from Trails-End.com, you won't be offered as many afterwards. </font></p><p><font size="+1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">
                            Examples of How TEC-IT Sites Use Cookies:</font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">A cookie lets the computer remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our 
                            sites. Similarly, the Trails-End Store uses a temporary cookie to track which products you've chosen to purchase while shopping. The cookie expires once you're done shopping. Letting it do the record keeping saves you 
                            the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. If you decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your selections. </font></p><p><font size="+1" face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Examples of How TEC-IT Sites Do Not Use Cookies:</font><font size="+1"> </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">TEC-IT Sites never use cookies to retrieve 
                            information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described below, TEC-IT Sites do not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that 
                            information shared with any other third parties than the BSA whatsoever. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">TEC-IT Sites do not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping (see above) and contest registration 
                            (where a cookie allows you to enter a contest every day without registering again each time). </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you 
                            when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some areas of the site, such as any shopping, contest, or game areas, will not function properly if you do so. </font></p><p><b><font size="+1" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Links to Other Sites</font></b></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Users should be aware that when you are on TEC-IT sites you could be directed to other sites that 
                            are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from TEC-IT sites that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" takes you off TEC-IT 
                            site. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use TEC-IT logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal 
                            information. Always be aware of where you end up. </font></p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Univers,Zurich BT">Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online - for example, via message boards or chat - that information can be collected and used by 
                            people you don't know. While TEC-IT strives to protect its user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. </font></p><p><b>
