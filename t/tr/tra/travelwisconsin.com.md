# Privacy and Legal

State of Wisconsin laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public's right to access public records provided by both state and federal laws. These exceptions include the privacy of individuals.

Information collected at this site becomes public record and may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exception in law exists. During your visit to the Department 's Web site, information that is not readily identifiable to an individual is automatically collected and stored. This information is used solely to improve our Web services. For more detail on our privacy policy, please see the expanded statement following.
