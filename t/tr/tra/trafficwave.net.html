<br><br>
<b>How does TrafficWave.net use the information collected?</b>
<br>
We will aggregate member and visitor information and perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our members and visitors, to measure overall demographics and interests regarding specific areas of our network and to analyze how and where to use our resources. We also use the aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors and members as to the number of people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement, requested further information, or have responded to any offer provided by our members via our network. In addition, TrafficWave.net may compile and disclose aggregate information about its visitors and members for promotional or other purposes. For example, we might want to disclose that a certain percentage of our members are located within a particular geographic area or fall within a particular age range. 

<br><br>

<b>Does TrafficWave.net use cookies?</b>
<br>
TrafficWave.net uses both session cookies and persistent cookies (for an explanation of cookies, please see http://www.epic.org/privacy/internet/cookies/). Cookies help us determine how long visitors view particular content, which particular content (e.g., advertising) visitors view, which content or sites visitors link to, and which of our services members and visitors use.
<br><br>
Persistent cookies are randomly generated and uniquely assigned to each visitor. They are not associated with any personally identifiable information such as name or password. 
<br><br>
Session cookies help us keep track of when a person is logged in. Once a member is logged in, session cookies allow us to personalize information on our Web site for them, as well as keep track of areas to which they have membership privileges.
