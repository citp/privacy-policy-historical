# Privacy Policy

Training Industry, Inc. 

## COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY 

Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Training Industry, Inc., we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. 

Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

## INFORMATION TRAINING INDUSTRY, INC. GATHERS AND TRACKS 

Training Industry, Inc. gathers two types of information about users: 

Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters and publications, to attend webinars and events, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and for participation in polls and surveys. 

Information Training Industry, Inc. gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Under no circumstances does Training Industry, Inc. divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 

Training Industry, Inc. gathers user information in the following processes: 

Optional voluntary information 

We offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users: 

  1. Newsletters, Alerts and Publications 

We will offer a free electronic newsletter and publications to users. Training Industry, Inc. gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every message that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters, bulletins and publications at the time of registration. 

  2. Message boards/forums 

Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although they do not need to register to visit the site. During registration, the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address. 

  3. "E-mail this to a friend" service 

Users on our site can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or document to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a friend". The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose. 

  4. Polling 

We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Training Industry, Inc. may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users. 

  5. Surveys 

Training Industry, Inc. may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party. 

  6. Webinars 




> Training Industry, Inc. offers a robust calendar of webinar programs, designed to connect attendees with industry thought leaders and best practices. By registering for a Training Industry webinar, professionals consent to receive marketing messages from Training Industry, Inc. regarding webinars, publications and other services designed to support training professionals. Information provided by webinar registrants may be shared with webinar sponsors to further educational opportunities and knowledge transfer for training professionals. 

## Children

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. 

## Usage tracking 

Training Industry, Inc. tracks user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Training Industry, Inc. does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). 

Training Industry, Inc. sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter into our search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

## Cookies
