Introduction

At travelbrazilian.com  we take your privacy very seriously and we’re committed to protecting your personal information online.

This statement explains how we collect and use the information which you give us. A link to this Policy is available from all websites to which it applies.

Our aim is to safeguard your privacy whilst providing a personalised and valuable service. Collecting personal information is necessary if we are to satisfy the expectations and requirements of our supporters.

We appreciate that you don’t want the personal information you provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we use your personal information and let you know what rights you have regarding its use.

Personal information

In some areas of our website, we ask you to provide personal information that will enable us to enhance your site visit or contact you with information you request or that may be of interest to you.

Examples of your personal information include your name, postal address, phone number and email address.

How is the information used?

If you have indicated that you are interested in receiving further information about our activities, we may send you direct marketing we feel may be of interest to you. You can ask us to stop sending you such information at any time by contacting us using the contact information above.

We will only send you information about our work by email where you have given us your consent to do so.

We may send you any information we believe may be of interest to you.  Emails we send you will always give you the chance to opt out of receiving further emails or alternatively, you can contact us using the contact information above. We do not send out random, untargeted emails, known as spam.

We may occasionally share your contact details with other like-minded organisations unless you ask us not to by contacting us using the contact information above.

travelbrazilian.com  will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except as outlined in this policy or when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe the law requires it.

We may occasionally use carefully selected agents to process information on our behalf, such as a mailing house to post communications to supporters. Third parties to which we transfer your information are only authorised to use that information to fulfil their contractual obligations to us and will not be permitted to use it for any other purpose. We retain full responsibility for how your personal information may be used by our agents.

We collect information about the date and time in which our web site was accessed and the internet address of the server from which you linked to our site. This may be linked to personal data you have given us. We use this data to improve our site performance and to evaluate traffic statistics, such as the times of day and days of week at which we see peak traffic, and to assess the relative popularity of different areas of the site.

Accuracy

The accuracy of your information is important to us. If you change email address or if any of the other information we hold is inaccurate or out of date please contact us using the above contact information.

Any information we hold that is incorrect will be amended or deleted promptly. We will give you confirmation of corrections and deletions.

Security

We place great importance on the security of your personal information and we always try to take appropriate precautions to protect it.

We maintain our own server and monitor its security regularly. The server is installed behind a locked door with access restricted to individuals known to us.

Whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information which you disclose to us online and you must understand that you do so at your own risk.

We are also concerned to protect your personal information off-line. We take steps to ensure that access to personal information is restricted to employees who need it. All travelbrazilian.com  employees who handle personal information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Our employees are notified and reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure your information is protected.

We cannot, however, be responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information whether we hold it on or off-line.
