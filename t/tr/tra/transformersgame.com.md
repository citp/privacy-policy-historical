Vendors provide goods and services (for example, billing, consumer services support, consultancy, information technology hardware and software) to Activision in order to support, operate and develop the Properties and to deliver marketing communications on our behalf. We do not share Information with vendors to use for their own direct marketing purposes or any other purpose without your consent.

Other third parties may need your Information in order to provide goods and/or services you have requested, for example, to deliver Activision digital content you have purchased through your games console, mobile phone, or tablet.

**Law**

**7\. Security**  
Activision takes a range of security measures designed to help protect your Information. However, complete online and offline security can never be guaranteed, so you should always take care when sharing your information online.

Click here for details Hide details

Activision takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, leaderboard rankings, and scores, etc.). We also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration. In addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information. However, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks. The complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.

**13\. Cookie Policy**  
Activision uses Cookies and/or similar technologies on the Properties. A "Cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that many websites and other online products and services often store on a user's computer or device in order to identify it and associate activity with it.

When visiting the Properties you have options to enable or disallow Cookies. We use Cookies to optimize your visit, make your browsing and user experience as effective as possible, and let you know about offers and features that we think will interest you. This means that if you disallow cookies, your use of the Properties may be impaired.

Depending on the Property you are using, and the country you are based in, Cookies may be set on your computer or device by either:

  * Activision - to recognize and associate activity with your computer or device when it visits a Property. Activision cookies cannot be used to recognize or associate activity with your computer or device when it visits other, third party websites or online properties.
  * Third Parties - to enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through our Properties or other online properties (e.g. advertising and analytics). The third parties that set these cookies may be able to recognize your computer or device both when it visits the Properties or other online properties that use the third party's features and functionality



Click here for details Hide details

**Types Of Cookies**  
There are four categories of Cookies that may be served through our Properties, described below. To see a list of the specific Cookies that may be served through our Properties, please see the Cookie List at the bottom of this Privacy Policy:

  * _Necessary Cookies_



These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around websites or online properties and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of a website. Without these cookies, Activision cannot provide services you have asked for, like secure login areas.

  * _Performance (or Analytics) Cookies_



These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website or online property, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information about the actual identity (e.g., name) of a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. They are only used to improve how a website or other online property works. We generally contract with independent research and measurement companies, such as Google Analytics, to provide these services on our behalf and these third parties also have their own privacy policies.

  * _Functionality Cookies_



These cookies allow the website or online property to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

  * _Advertising Cookies_



These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They also help limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website or online property operator's permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. In certain countries Activision may partner with third party online advertising and analytics companies to tailor and deliver advertisements, products, services, and promotions on our Properties, as well as other online properties which we do not control. To help select the ads of greatest interest to you, these companies may use cookies, Flash technology, and similar technologies to collect and track information such as demographic data (e.g., gender, occupation, etc.), aggregated information, search keywords, geo-location and device-related data (for example, browser type, language, IP address, time/date) to select advertisements that are more relevant to your interests, to better personalize the experience for you and tailor advertisements. In some instances, third-parties may also use cookies or similar technologies to collect anonymized or device-related information about your visits to the Properties in order to provide third party advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.

To learn more about Advertising Cookies and your opt-out choices, visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at [http://networkadvertising.org](http://networkadvertising.org/) or [http://youronlinechoices.com](http://youronlinechoices.com/).

Activision may use and share anonymized or aggregated information obtained from cookies with third parties such as vendors or advertising partners. An example of the use of such information would be creating interest categories or segments based on region, gaming preferences, or a combination. We may also share personal and non-personal information obtained from cookies with third parties such as vendors or advertising networks in order to permit them to provide services on our behalf or to partner with us in selecting and serving advertisements for us or our advertising partners.

**Social Network Sites**

If you have signed in to a social networking site, such as Facebook, it may have set a cookie on your device which recognizes you when you view content on our websites and other online properties. These cookies allow you to share content across social media via the use of sharing settings. See your social networking site's terms of use and privacy policy for details. For additional details, please see the Social Media in the _Information We Collect And How We Use It_ and _Your Choices_ sections above.

**Do Not Track**

California Business and Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) permits our customers who are California residents to be informed as to how Activision responds to Web browser "Do Not Track" settings. As Do Not Track is a standard that is currently being developed, Activision does not take actions to respond to Do Not Track settings, and instead we adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy.

**Permission to Use Cookies**

Please also note that the use of information obtained by third party providers listed in the Cookies List below through cookies placed by them is also subject to their own privacy policies. Information collected by cookies may be associated with your registration account or user profile.

**Flash cookies, web beacons, IP addresses**  
Adobe Flash Player is an application that allows sites to deploy dynamic web content. Adobe Flash and similar applications use technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage in ways that are similar to browser cookies, but are managed through a different interface than your web browser. You can access your Flash management tools from <http://www.adobe.com/> directly to manage your cookie settings. From time to time, we may use web beacons (or clear GIFs) on our Properties or include them in the email messages we send you. Web beacons (also known as "web bugs") are small strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. We use web beacons for many purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, advertising and email auditing and reporting, and personalization. We also keep track of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet.

**Cookies List**  
The Properties may contain, but are not limited to, the following third party Performance (or Analytics) and Advertising cookies. Please follow the links below for details of the Privacy Policies and opt out choices offered by these third parties. Please also see the Cookie Policy above for further options available to manage cookies.
