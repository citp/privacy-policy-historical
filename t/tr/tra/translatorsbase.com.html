        The purpose of our privacy statement is to make our clients aware of our dedication
        to preserve Translatorsbase customer privacy. As our services require us to collect client
        information, Translatorsbase has created this privacy statement in order to communicate
        our information gathering practices and procedures.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Information Collection and Use</b>
        <br>
        Translatorsbase located at  3500 West Olive Avenue, 3rd Floor

        , email: <a href="mailto:service@Translatorsbase.com">service@Translatorsbase.com</a>
        is the organizations collecting the Personally Identifiable Information and/or Third
        Party Personally Identifiable Information through the Site.
        <br>
        <br>
        When a user contracts Translatorsbase services, the user is required to provide such
        information as their name, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address,
        product selection, and billing information. It is possible that we will also ask
        for additional information such as company industry, number of employees, etc.,
        at the time our service is contracted or if interest in our services is expressed.
        It is optional for customers to provide this additional information, and users may
        choose not to do so when they activate services with Translatorsbase or request information
        on our services.
        <br>
        <br>
        When Translatorsbase captures user information upon sign-up, we use the client information
        to activate the customer account. Once a client has signed up with Translatorsbase, future
        mailing may periodically be sent out to the Translatorsbase client base, introducing
        new products, product updates, and important Translatorsbase news and information. Our
        users and clients have the option of receiving the Translatorsbase company newsletter.
        Should a client choose to receive the newsletter via e-mail, we will not distribute
        the user e-mail address for any other purpose than the sending of our newsletter
        or other Translatorsbase service information. If a user would like to cease receiving
        the newsletter or other promotional e-mail correspondence from Translatorsbase, they
        may send an e-mail request to <a href="mailto:service@Translatorsbase.com">service@Translatorsbase.com</a>
        and immediately be removed from future mailings. Translatorsbase requires a valid, working
        e-mail address upon account setup in order to send our client account information
        details, including a welcome packet, and account username and password.
        <br>
        <br>
        Translatorsbase does not disclose any user/customer information to any third party, other
        than what we explicitly state upon account activation or as detailed in our Terms
        of Use. Billing and financial information is required upon account activation for
        Translatorsbase to bill for services rendered. Translatorsbase will only use this billing
        information to verify the validity of the account, and bill for Translatorsbase services.
        When Translatorsbase bills for services rendered, a third-party processing company is
        used to charge customer credit cards and collect payment. This third-party is used
        only to process credit card charges, and does not store or distribute customer credit
        card or billing information.
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, the Translatorsbase website may contain content from third-party content
        providers, but these content providers neither receive nor distribute Translatorsbase
        user or customer information, nor do they receive user or customer information from
        Translatorsbase.
        <br>
        <br>
        Translatorsbase provides a service where our customers upload and store their data on
        Translatorsbase servers and equipment. Translatorsbase does not review, edit, disseminate,
        or use this data in any way, except as may be required by law, or as outlined in
        our Terms of Use. Customer data or records may be viewed from time to time to handle
        a technical support request that is initiated by the client, or to resolve any other
        problem or technical issue. Additionally, we reserve the right to disclose your
        personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that
        disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding,
        court order, or legal process served on our Company or Web site, or if there is
        a suspected Terms of Use violation.
        <br>
        <br>
        Translatorsbase users are solely and individually responsible for maintaining the privacy
        and confidentiality of their own data, as well as their usernames and passwords.
        Translatorsbase may collect information from visitors to the Translatorsbase web site. Most
        commonly, we may collect the Internet addresses of Translatorsbase site visitors. We
        use the information that we log from the Translatorsbase website to both improve our
        services, and help troubleshoot possible Translatorsbase website problems. We may also
        analyze non-identifying statistics that we collect from website visitor usage, and
        provide this data to qualified third parties.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Cookies</b>
        <br>
        Security protocols put into operation by Translatorsbase are determined by encrypted
        session Ids and dynamic data. Should you select to activate the Translatorsbase "Remember
        Me" feature, we will use a "cookie" that contains partial or full authentication
        information depending on your preference. The cookie will reside on your local system.
        Further, We use a third party to provide statistical analysis regarding our users
        use of the <a href="http://www.translatorsbase.com/">www.translatorsbase.com</a>
        <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
            &nbsp;</span>web site and may set cookies in order to gather the information
        needed to perform their statistical analysis. The information collected by the third
        party cookies does not contain any personal information or can be linked back to
        any individual user.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Log Files</b>
        <br>
        We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement,
        and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not
        linked to personally identifiable information.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Links</b>
        <br>
        Our web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we Translatorsbase.
        are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage
        our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements
        of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This
        privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site or the
        Translatorsbase application.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Surveys </b>
        <br>
        From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation
        in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether
        or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information
        and demographic information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring
        or improving the use and satisfaction of this site or of the Translatorsbase application.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Security</b>
        <br>
        Translatorsbase has chosen to implement the latest technology that allows for the highest
        levels of Internet security that are possible today. If you are accessing our site
        with 4.0 versions or higher of Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator
        browsers, your information is encrypted and authenticated, using Secure Socket Layer
        (SSL) technology. The SSL systems provide complete data security for you and your
        users, and the authentication ensures that your valuable content is available only
        to registered users, and is not accessible to unwanted parties. Each registered
        user is provided with a unique username and password. Each time a user logs onto
        Translatorsbase.com or Directfreelance.com website, he can only be authenticated
        and allowed access using the correct username and password that has been assigned.
        A session is issued for the purpose of capturing encrypted authentication data for
        the length of the session. Neither the username nor the password is included in
        the session. Security protocols put into operation by Translatorsbase are determined
        by encrypted session Ids and dynamic data. Should you select to activate the Translatorsbase
        "Remember Me" feature, we will use a "cookie" that contains partial or full authentication
        information depending on your preference. The cookie will reside on your local system.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Opt-Out Policy</b>
        <br>
        Translatorsbase offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information
        provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering Services,
        you change your mind about receiving information from us, send us a request specifying
        your new choice. Simply send your request to service@Translatorsbase.com<br>
