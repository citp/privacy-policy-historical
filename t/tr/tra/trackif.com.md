By using or visiting the MyAlerts Website or using the Applications, you agree to the collection and use of information in the manner described in this policy. MyAlerts shall have right at any time and without prior notice, at its sole discretion, to revise this policy. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by email, by means of a notice the next time you log in to the MyAlerts Website, by means of a notice on the MyAlerts Website homepage or when you next activate the Application. Such revisions and additions shall be effective immediately upon notice. You are responsible for reviewing the MyAlerts Website or Applications periodically for any modification to this policy.

## The Information We Collect

This policy applies to all information collected on the MyAlerts Website, any information you provide to MyAlerts and any information that results from your use of Applications. You will most likely provide us personal information to us when you register as a user of MyAlerts Website, license and then use the Applications or participate in certain MyAlerts promotions or events. The personal information we may collect might include: passwords, user names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and credit/debit card numbers. 

## The Applications

The Applications allow users to track information about products and services and internet searches. When you use the Applications to search for products/services or save searches, the Applications enable you to automatically “track” the product/services and searches. If your tracking criteria are met (e.g. the product goes on sale, the product meets your target price point or a new search result is found), MyAlerts will notify you of such information using a variety of communication methods, including, but not limited to, push notifications, email alerts, SMS messages, browser notifications and social network messages. 

Use of the Applications is subject to the terms and conditions of the Application License Agreement (click here to review the license associated with the Applications: [www.myalerts.com/applicenseterms](https://web.archive.org/pages/applicenseterms) ). 

## Blogs and Product Reviews

The MyAlerts Website or Applications may include blogs, product reviews or other message areas that allow users to post or send information to the MyAlerts Website or the Applications. When you post information to the MyAlerts Website or Applications, others can also view that information. We urge you to exercise caution when providing personally identifiable information to MyAlerts, MyAlerts Website or the Applications. 

## Our Collection of Your Data

In addition to the personal information you supply, we may collect certain information to (1) evaluate how visitors, guests, and customers use the MyAlerts Website or the Applications; or (2) provide you with personalized information or offers. We collect data to make the MyAlerts Website and Applications work better for you in the following ways: to improve the design of the MyAlerts Website and Applications, to provide personalization on the MyAlerts Website and Applications and to evaluate the performance of our marketing programs. The technologies we may use to gather this non-personal information may include “IP” addresses, “cookies”, browser detection, “weblogs” and various “geo-location” tools. 

## How we Collect and Use Information

Our primary goal in collecting your information is to provide you with a personalized, relevant, and positive experience with the MyAlerts Website and Applications. 

You can register on the MyAlerts Website or the Applications to receive promotions and updates, or to be contacted for market research purposes. In addition, if you use the Applications, MyAlerts, as part of those Applications, may send you push notifications (texts, sounds or pop-ups that are initiated without having to open the Applications), text messages, emails or other communications related to your use of the Applications. You can control your privacy preferences regarding such communications (see the section below entitled “Your Privacy Preferences”). 

From time to time, you may be invited to participate in optional customer surveys or promotions, and MyAlerts may request that you provide some or all of the above listed personal information in those surveys or promotions. We use information collected from surveys and promotions to learn about our customers in order to improve our services and develop new products and services of interest to our customers. 

IP addresses define the Internet location of computers and help us better understand the geographic distribution of our visitors and customers and manage the performance of the MyAlerts Website. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer when you visit the MyAlerts Website, so we can immediately recognize you when you return to the MyAlerts Website and deliver content specific to your interests. You may modify your browser preferences to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or reject all cookies. Please consult your browser instructions for information on how to modify your choices about cookies.

By using the Application we will have access to (1) information related to the products/services or searches you are tracking (including, but not limited to, the product/services name, search criteria, price, SKU and product/services or search description); (2) a history of our communications related to your use of the Applications, including your actions related to such communications; and (3) information related to a product or service that you tracked using the Applications and subsequently purchased. The Applications may also include the ability to link certain geographical information made available by us with your physical location.

To the extent that your physical location can be determined by the Applications, we may use your location to make available information to you that is relevant because of your physical location. 

We may also compile certain general information related to your use of the Website and Applications. You agree that we are authorized to use, reproduce and generally make such information available to third parties in the aggregate, provided that your information shall not include personally identifiable information about you or be attributable to you.

Such MyAlerts affiliates or retail partners may place on your computer a tracking device such as a “cookie” (please see the fourth paragraph of the “How we Collect and Information” above for more information about “cookies”). The information collected by such tracking devices may be used by the affiliate or retail partner to calculate fees due from MyAlerts or fees payable to MyAlerts.
