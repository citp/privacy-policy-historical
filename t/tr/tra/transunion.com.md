**Purpose and Use.** Through TransUnion’s Digital Marketing services, we enable our business partners to communicate with consumers in a digital environment. In an effort to provide relevant products and services to consumers, these businesses use our data and technology to create, deploy, and measure targeted advertising programs digitally. We collect information as outlined below and use it for permitted marketing uses. In addition, we may aggregate and depersonalize data for analytical purposes, to provide reporting to our business partners, and for measuring advertising performance. And as a part of enabling Digital Marketing services, we may use service providers.

**Data Collected.** The information we collect (“Marketing Data”) for our Digital Marketing business is segregated from traditional consumer reporting agency information. Marketing Data may include information on consumers, households, properties and businesses as well as nonpersonal aggregated information and advertising program performance data. Marketing Data includes information about consumers such as demographics, life events, public records, or firmographics. Demographic data includes information such as age, gender, income, occupation, education, and marital status. Life events data includes information such as a recent move or home purchase. Public records data includes information such as summarized U.S. Census data, geographic data, and property data from local tax assessor and recorded deed information. firmographic data includes information such as type of business, years in business, size of business, and job titles.

**Sharing Data.** We share Marketing Data with our business partners to facilitate the creation and deployment of digital advertising. For example, when we segment our data into groups of consumers (“Audiences”), we share it using unique identifiers (“Unique IDs”). We use a proprietary process to convert our data into Unique IDs that do not contain personally identifiable information. We may also share aggregated and depersonalized data with our business partners for analytical purposes, including measuring advertising performance and reporting. Many of our business partners are Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) members and/or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) participants and are required to comply with those respective codes of conduct or principles.
