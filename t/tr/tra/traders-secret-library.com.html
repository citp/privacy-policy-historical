      <p align="center"><b>Warning!</b></p>
      <p>Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some 
        of which are mentioned below. No representation is being made that any 
        account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those 
        shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical 
        performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular 
        trading program.</p>
      <p>One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they 
        are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical 
        trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record 
        can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. 
      </p>
      <p>For example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular 
        trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which 
        can also adversely affect trading results. There are numerous other factors 
        related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific 
        trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation 
        of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect 
        actual trading results.</p>
