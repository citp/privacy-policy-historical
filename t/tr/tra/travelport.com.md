# Orbitz for Business | Travelport, part of the Cendant Corporate Travel family

Privacy Policy  
This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") applies only to users of this web site and not to the services provided by Travelport Corporate Solutions, Inc. and/or Orbitz, LLC (collectively, "Cendant Corporate Travel Solutions" or "CCTS"). The primary purpose of this web site is to provide information to the public regarding CCTS and its affiliates.

  
We collect information by specifically requesting it from you. Generally this occurs when you register at a web site or request information or a service. The information collected may include personally identifiable information ("PII") such as first and last name, email address, mailing address and/or phone number.

  
An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Internet so that your computer can be identified by the main computers, known as "Web servers," that "serve up" Web pages.

CCTS and/or its affiliates collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information and to audit the use of our web site. When users request pages from this web site, our servers log the users' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user will remain anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our web site terms of use or terms of service or to protect our service, web site, users or others.

  
 _What are cookies?_  
Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes, which information is stored in a file on your computer. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use the saved information to facilitate your use of our web site when you return to the site. Cookies do not tell us your individual identity unless you have chosen to provide it to us. We never save passwords in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and as such, you'll find that most major web sites use them.

By showing how and when users use a web site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the web site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users' needs.

Most cookies expire after a defined period of time, or you can delete your cookie file at any time. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of this web site will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies.

This web site has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to specify a user's preferences. Second, we use cookies to track users' web site usage trends and patterns. This helps us understand our users' needs better and improve areas of this web site's services that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of cookies, you have the option of disabling the cookies via your browser preferences.

 _With whom does this web site share my information?_  
As a general rule, CCTS will not disclose any PII that you submit to us through this web site in a manner that connects you with the information, except when we do so in the course of providing services to you or as requested by law enforcement officials.

Other: CCTS may also disclose PII obtained from users of this web site in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating CCTS' terms of use or terms of service, or may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with any of CCTS' rights or property, other CCTS users, or anyone else. CCTS may disclose or access PII and/or account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services.

 _How can you control the usage of information?_  
In case you change your mind or some information changes (such as your zip code or e-mail address), we will try to provide a way to correct, update or remove the information that you give us. If a user wishes to update personal information or objects to any usage provided herein for any reason, he/she may contact: 

Cendant Corporate Travel Services   
Chief Privacy Officer  
Fax: 312.894.5070  
Phone: 312.894.5000 

In the event we make a change to this Privacy Policy, we will advise you by posting a new effective date for this Privacy Policy.

 _What happens when you link to a third party site?_  
You should be aware that when you are on this web site, you could hyperlink or be directed to other web sites that are beyond our control and/or outside our service. These other web sites may include web sites of advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use CCTS' and/or its affiliates' logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit PII.

CCTS and its affiliates do not control such web sites, and, therefore, are not responsible for their contents or the hyperlinks or advertising they choose to place on such web sites. CCTS' and/or its affiliates' inclusion of hyperlinks to these web sites do not imply any endorsement of the material on such web sites or any association with their operators. CCTS' Privacy Policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, which is beyond CCTS' and its affiliates' control.

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out information online (for example, via message boards or chat) that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While CCTS and its affiliates strive to protect their users' information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you disclose such information at your own risk.

 _Is my information secure from others using the web site?_  
The security of all information associated with users of this web site is an important concern to us. We exercise care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, CCTS and its affiliates cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, CCTS uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, such as firewalls and secure socket layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

  
By using this site, you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SITE. Your continued use of CCTS' and/or its affiliates' sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
