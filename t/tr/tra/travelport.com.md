## Travelport GDS Privacy Policy

Welcome to this **Travelport** website. We at Travelport recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of personal data or personally identifiable information (“ **Personal Information** ”) about the individual travelers that we process in our global distribution systems and about the users and visitors of our website. The following **Privacy Policy** discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it. Please note, however, that we may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. At Travelport, we want to give you an understanding about how we collect your information and the use we make of it in the course of our business.  
  
**Travelport GDS**   
Travelport recognizes that many countries have adopted laws that apply to Personal Information about individual travelers that we process in our global distribution systems (“ **GDS Personal Information** ”), including our Apollo™, Galileo™, and Worldspan™ global distribution systems. We refer to each of these systems as a “Travelport GDS”. This section of our Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store and process GDS Personal Information about individual travelers.

  This section of our Privacy Policy does not cover how travel suppliers, such as an airline, car rental company, or a hotel (a “ **Travel Supplier** ”), handle Personal Information. It also does not cover the Personal Information activities of a travel agency or other company that subscribes to a Travelport GDS (a “ **Subscriber** ”). It also does not include Personal Information about users obtained through our public websites. We recommend that travelers should carefully review the privacy policies of their Travel Suppliers and Subscribers. The diagram below illustrates our function in the purchase of travel. 

 

**European Safe Harbor**  
Travelport does most of its processing of GDS Personal Information in Travelport data centres located in the United States of America. We recognize that the European Union (EU) and Switzerland have data protection laws. The EU and the Swiss requirements restrict the transfer to the United States of Personal Information about Europeans, unless there is “adequate protection” for such information when it is received in the United States.

  To address this restriction as applied to GDS Personal Information about European Travelers, Travelport complies with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor program (“ **Safe Harbor** ”). For these purposes, a “ **European Traveler** ” is a traveler whose personal data is entered by a Travelport GDS Subscriber located in the EU or Switzerland, regardless of the traveler’s nationality, residence, or location.

  Although we take seriously the personal data of all travelers, our participation in Safe Harbor benefits European Travelers and does not cover travelers using a Subscriber located outside of the EU and Switzerland. 

 **Collection, Use, and Disclosure  
**Travelport obtains GDS Personal Information when a Travel Supplier or a Subscriber submits such data to a Travelport GDS. We also receive GDS Personal Information when an individual traveler submits data to us directly; however, this occurs only in limited circumstances. The types of GDS Personal Information that we obtain is the typical information that you provide when you travel. This includes: 

  * name, 
  * date of birth, 
  * gender, 
  * postal address, 
  * e-mail address, 
  * telephone number, 
  * credit card and payment information, 
  * travel and accommodation details, 
  * passport information, and 
  * special travel requests, such as a request for a wheelchair or a special meal. 



We use GDS Personal Information to: 

  * process travel bookings, 
  * provide Subscribers and Travel Suppliers with access to travel information, 
  * make and change travel reservations, 
  * perform billing and accounting functions related to the travel, 
  * perform internal business processes (such as testing and quality assurance), and 
  * issue tickets and other travel-related documents on behalf of travelers. 



We disclose GDS Personal Information to Travel Suppliers and Subscribers, as well as to the processors that act on their behalf, to carry out these activities and to help perform the underlying contracts with travelers.

We also disclose GDS Personal Information to vendors that perform functions on our behalf, including suppliers of software development services, business processing service providers, contact center service providers, training service providers, and computer maintenance providers. We require such vendors to maintain appropriate protections for GDS Personal Information and to only process such data in accordance with our instructions.

We may also process and disclose GDS Personal Information as required by law, subpoena, or regulation; when requested by government or law enforcement authorities; for credit card processing, authentication, and fraud prevention; or as otherwise required or permitted by law. We do not sell GDS Personal Information for purposes of allowing third parties to conduct direct marketing for their own products or services.

**Data Security and Integrity  
**Travelport maintains reasonable measures to protect GDS Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Travelport also takes reasonable steps – to the extent reasonably possible in the context of our role as an intermediary between Travel Suppliers and Subscribers – to keep GDS Personal Information accurate, current, complete, and reliable for its intended use.   
**  
Data Retention  
**Travelport retains GDS Personal Information no longer than is necessary to comply with legal obligations and to fulfill legitimate business and compliance purposes. **De-Personalized Data  
**Travelport analyzes, uses, discloses, and processes statistical and other data in de-personalized form that Travelport obtains or generates in connection with its Travelport GDS business. This data is used to identify trends and other activities in the travel industry.  
  
**Information from Minors  
**Travelport GDS services are not intended for use by minors. We do not knowingly collect GDS Personal Information from any minor child.  
  
**Data Access Requests and Other Questions  
**Travelers should direct any requests to access their own GDS Personal Information, or any other privacy questions, to Travelport at [privacy@travelport.com](mailto:privacy@travelport.com). In practice, travelers may first wish to contact their Travel Supplier or Subscriber, because that might be the most efficient means of addressing any issues. Travelport retains the right to use reasonable measures to authenticate the identity of any traveler who requests access to their GDS Personal Information or otherwise raises any questions. In addition, if any European Traveler experiences an issue regarding GDS Personal Information that the European Traveler cannot resolve directly with Travelport, such traveler may contact their local data protection authority for further information. 

If you do not consent to the data use described in this policy, you may choose not to use a Subscriber’s services.
