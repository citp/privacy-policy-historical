<span class="style3">PRIVACY POLICY</span><br>
    <br>
  This website is operated by: (1) Paramount Pictures Corporation on its own
  behalf or in combination with Paramount Home Entertainment, Inc., Paramount
  Vantage, a division of Paramount Pictures Corporation, or DreamWorks L.L.C.;
  (2) Paramount Home Entertainment, Inc.; or (3) Paramount Vantage (collectively, “Company” or "we", "us",
  or "our"), which are all part of the entertainment operations of
  Viacom Inc.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to all of the websites operated
  by Company (unless a different policy is provided on a particular site, in
  which case such different policy shall control). This Privacy Policy explains
  what information Company collects on this website, how we use your information
  and the choices you have about the way your information is collected and used. &nbsp;Please
  read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of this website indicates that
  you have read and accepted our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy
  Policy. In addition, please review our <a href="termsofuse.php?bgcolor=000000&amp;fontcolor=CCCCCC&amp;linkcolor=00CCFF" target="_self">Terms
  of Use</a> that governs your use of this website.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy,
  like the online medium itself, is subject to change, so visitors are encouraged
  to review this Privacy Policy from time to time. Company reserves the right
  to alter, modify, update, add to, subtract from or otherwise change this Privacy
  Policy at any time for any reason or no reason at all. We will post any changes
  here, and any changes will become effective immediately upon being posted unless
  we tell you otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      <strong><u>Notice to California Residents / Your California Privacy Rights</u>:</strong>&nbsp; <br>
  California residents are entitled once a year to request and obtain certain
  information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third
  parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar
  year (e.g. requests made in 2006 will receive information about 2005 sharing
  activities). As set forth in this Privacy Policy, we comply with this law by
  offering our visitors the ability to tell us not to share your personally identifiable
  information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make
  such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:californiaprivacy@paramount.com">californiaprivacy@paramount.com</a>.&nbsp; You
  must include this website as the subject line, and your full name, e-mail address,
  and postal address in your message.&nbsp; Please see the "<a href="#yourchoices">Your Choices</a>" section
  of this Privacy Policy for additional information.<br>
</p>
<p align="justify" class="style2"><strong>INFORMATION COMPANY COLLECTS</strong> <br>
    <strong><u><br>
      Personally Identifiable Information:<br>
    </u></strong>Personally identifiable information (<strong>"PII"</strong>)
    is information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify
    you personally (such as your real name, address, phone number, or e-mail
    address).&nbsp; We may ask you to provide us with certain PII, when you register
    with us, or at other times, such as if you choose to sign-up for an e-mail
    newsletter, participate in a game, contest, sweepstakes, or other promotional
    event. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information, information
    regarding your interests, or similar information. <br>
    <br>
  Providing us with information about yourself is voluntary, and you can always
  choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to
  take advantage of or participate in many of the website's features.<br>
    <br>
  In addition, you may have the opportunity to provide us with the PII, such
  as name or e-mail address, of a friend (or for a friend to provide such information
  about you), such as if you chose to e-mail a friend an article, electronic
  greeting card, trailer or other special feature from our website. The e-mail
  addresses you supply us for those activities will not be retained for other
  purposes unless otherwise disclosed at the time you provide such information.
  We encourage you to send such items only to recipients who are your friends
  or family or persons with whom you have a relationship so that it doesn't seem
  like we are "spamming" them.<br>
    <br>
  If you submit to Company a comment, photograph or other content to be published
  by Company (either online or offline), we may publish your name or other PII
  in connection with publishing the content. <br>
    <br>
  We may combine the information about you that we collect at this website with
  information available to us from other sources. For example, you may provide
  PII to us at other Company websites, or our co-promoters or sponsors may provide
  us with information, including PII, about users that choose to participate
  in a promotional opportunity the co-promoter or sponsor is offering in connection
  with Company.<br>
    <strong><u><br>
      Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</u></strong> <br>
  When your computer contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit this
  website, view an HTML e-mail, or download an interactive desktop from the website),
  our web servers automatically collect website usage information. Website usage
  information is non-identifying information that describes how our visitors
  use and navigate our website. It can include the number and frequency of visitors
  to each web page and the length of their stays, browser type, referrer data
  that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our website,
  and IP addresses (see below for more information on IP addresses). We also
  may determine the applicable technology available in order to serve you the
  most appropriate version of a web page, e-mail or similar service.<br>
    <strong><u><br>
      Use of Cookies:</u></strong> <br>
  Like most websites, this website sometimes makes use of browser "cookies." Cookies
  are pieces of information that a website either transfers to your computer's
  hard drive or stores temporarily in your computer's memory for record-keeping
  purposes. Company does not save PII in cookies. We may use cookies for a number
  of purposes. For example, we sometimes use cookies when we conduct polls, contests
  or sweepstakes to limit multiple responses and registrations. Or, we may use
  cookies to track usage patterns on the website or to analyze web activity.<br>
    <br>
  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser
  to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However,
  if you decline to accept Company cookies, you may not be able to take advantage
  of or participate in certain features of this website.<br>
    <strong><u><br>
      Use of Web Beacons:</u></strong> <br>
  Our web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a
  web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "clear gif", that allows
  us to monitor and collect certain limited information about our users, such
  as the type of browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the computer
  that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web beacon was viewed. Web
  beacons can be very small and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic
  image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail, including HTML based content,
  can act as a web beacon. Company may use web beacons to count visitors to our
  web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our website, and we may include
  web beacons in e-mail messages in order to count how many messages we sent
  were actually opened or acted upon. Company uses web beacons to compile aggregate
  statistics about our website and our marketing campaigns. Company does not
  link the information collected by its web beacons to the PII you provide when
  registering with the website.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style2"><strong><u>Use of Javascript</u></strong><br>
  Our websites employ Google Analytics which uses a first-party cookie and JavaScript
    code that is stored on Google's server to anonymously track how users interact
    with our websites, including where they came from and what they did on our
    websites.&nbsp; Company does not link the information collected by Google
    Analytics to the PII you provide when registering with the website.<br>
    <strong><u><br>
      Use Of IP Addresses</u></strong>: <br>
  An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer or network when
  you are on the Internet. When you request pages from this website, our servers
  log your IP address. Company may use IP address for a number of purposes, such
  as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners
  or to audit the use of the website.&nbsp; We may associate your IP address
  with the PII you provide.<br>
      <strong><u><br>
        Children Under Thirteen (13) Years Of Age:</u></strong> <br>
  Company does not knowingly collect any PII from children under thirteen (13)
  years of age unless the collection complies with the Children's Online Privacy
  Protection Act (<strong>"COPPA"</strong>). If you are under thirteen
  (13) years of age, do not send any information about yourself to Company. If
  Company discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Company with
  PII, Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete that child's
  PII from its system.<br>
</p>
<p align="justify" class="style2"><strong>COMPANY'S USE AND DISCLOSURE OF COLLECTED
    INFORMATION</strong> <br>
    <strong><u><br>
      Use by Company:</u></strong> <br>
  Company may use your PII to provide you with requested information, services
  or content, to contact you in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or promotion,
  or for other purposes disclosed when you provide the information. We may also
  contact you from time to time on behalf of one of our affiliated companies
  or an external business partner with information that may be of interest to
  you.<br>
      <br>
  We may also contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating
  to your use of our website, or, in our discretion, notify you of changes to
  our Privacy Policy, <a href="termsofuse.php?bgcolor=000000&amp;fontcolor=CCCCCC&amp;linkcolor=00CCFF" target="_self">Terms of Use</a> or
  other policy or terms that affect you and your use of our website. Company
  may also use information about our users, including PII, for internal purposes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Sharing User Information and Disclosure to Third Parties:</u></strong><br>
  Unless otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, Company does not share your
  PII with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you first
  affirmatively agree to the disclosure. If you elect to receive communications
  from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy
  policy and not this privacy policy. Therefore, if you later decide that you
  do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact
  the third party directly.&nbsp; In addition, Company may share your PII with
  third parties under the following circumstances:<br>
    <strong><em><br>
      Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.</em></strong> <br>
  If you choose to enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, your PII
  may be disclosed to third parties in connection with such promotion, including
  without limitation for purposes of posting your entry with attribution or otherwise
  as permitted in the official rules for the promotion in question, fulfilling
  your prize or including your name on a winners list. Also, by entering a sweepstakes,
  contest or other promotion, we may require you to consent to the use of your
  PII or other information, such as name, voice or likeness, in advertising,
  promotional and marketing materials. In addition, we may offer certain promotional
  content, such as a sweepstakes, sponsored by or co-branded with a third party,
  who may obtain the PII that you submit, but only where specifically stated
  on the registration page or official rules for such promotion. <br>
    <strong><em><br>
      Third parties providing services on our behalf.<br>
    </em></strong>Company may employ other companies and individuals to perform
    functions on its behalf. Examples include, without limitation, hosting this
    website, sending communications on our behalf, analyzing data, providing
    marketing assistance, creating, hosting, administering and/or otherwise running
    contests/sweepstakes/games, serving ads and providing customer service. These
    third parties may have access to this website's user information, including
    PII, to the extent it is needed to perform their duties and functions.<br>
    <strong><em><br>
      Company's Security.</em></strong> <br>
  Company may disclose information about its users, including PII, when legally
  required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an
  investigation, or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing
  our website and applicable laws. Company may also disclose such user information
  whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability or
  to protect or enforce the rights, interests, or safety of the website, our
  users or others.<br>
    <strong><em><br>
      Corporate change.</em></strong> <br>
  Company reserves the right to disclose, share and/or otherwise transfer user
  information, including without limitation PII, in connection with a corporate
  merger, acquisition, consolidation, the sale of substantially all of its assets,
  or other fundamental corporate change, whatever form it may take.<br>
    <strong><em><br>
      Transfer of Site.</em></strong> <br>
  Without in any way limiting the rights Company has reserved above in the event of a "Corporate Change", Company shall be entitled to transfer information it collects, including without limitation PII, to any third party that assumes, acquires or is otherwise authorized to take control over this website, provided such third party has agreed to use your PII in accordance with protections that in all material respects are the same as or more protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy.<br>
    <strong><em><br>
      Aggregate information.</em></strong> <br>
  Company may disclose non-identifying, aggregated user statistics to third parties
  for a variety of purposes, including describing Company's services to prospective
  partners and other third parties<br>
</p>
<p align="justify" class="style2"><strong>USER FORUMS</strong> <br>
  Please review our restrictions on use and guidelines for user forums in our
    <a href="termsofuse.php?bgcolor=000000&amp;fontcolor=CCCCCC&amp;linkcolor=00CCFF" target="_self">Terms of Use</a>. In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not
    apply to any information you may disclose publicly in user forums (such as
    chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages). You should keep in mind
    that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online, that
    information could be collected and used by people that you do not know. In
    addition, certain message boards (and similar user forums) may display IP
    addresses and possibly PII along with the message poster's name and message.
    Company bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties
    who collect any information users may disclose in user forums or other public
    areas, if any, of this website.<br>
    <strong><br>
<a name="yourchoices">
      YOUR CHOICES/UNSUBSCRIBE</a></strong><a name="yourchoices"> <br>
  To unsubscribe from receiving promotional material from this website, </a><a href="http://assist.mailchute.paramountmovies.com" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a> or follow the instructions provided at the end of an e-mail message. Please
  be aware that we will process your request as quickly as we reasonably can,
  but it may not be possible to update our systems immediately.<br>
    <br>
  In addition, you should be aware that it is not always possible to completely
  remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual
  data because of backups and other reasons.<br>
    <br>
  If you want to opt out of having your PII shared with third parties for marketing
  purposes, you must consistently opt-out at each of our websites where you register
  and whenever you provide PII to us.&nbsp; Please bear in mind that this opt-out
  choice for "third parties" will not apply to Company, Company licensees
  and/or co-branding participants, as set forth below.&nbsp; Please also keep
  in mind that any opt-out choices you make will not apply in situations where
  (a) you either have made, simultaneously make, or later make a specific request
  for information from us, or (b) Company uses your PII for either operational
  purposes (e.g. to complete transactions requested by you, or to send you administrative
  communications either about your account with us or about features of our websites,
  including any future changes to this Privacy Policy, the <a href="termsofuse.php?bgcolor=000000&amp;fontcolor=CCCCCC&amp;linkcolor=00CCFF" target="_self">Terms
  of Use</a>, or any other policy or terms that affect you and your use of our
  website) or fulfillment purposes (e.g. sharing with companies that facilitate
  communications and transactions with you).<br>
    <br>
  Finally, if you do not exercise your opt-out choices upon registration or otherwise
  at the time the PII is provided, it may take some time to process your opt-out
  choices. Our systems require time to update, and promotional mailings using
  PII shared before your opt-out may already be in process. Thus, your PII might
  continue to be shared with third parties for promotional purposes for some
  time after you make your request,&nbsp; For similar reasons, if your PII is
  shared with a third party, Company largely or completely loses control over
  how that information is used.&nbsp; Thus, even after you have opted out of
  allowing us to share your PII, you might continue to receive promotional materials
  from third parties unless and until you duly register your opt-out request
  with each third party in question. <br>

      SECURITY</strong> <br>
  Company strives to ensure the security of your PII on our systems, including
  limiting access to the PII contained on our servers. Unfortunately, no data
  transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Company
  cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Company
  and you do so at your own risk.<br>
    <strong><br>
      LINKS</strong> <br>
  Please be aware that when you are navigating our website or viewing an e-mail
  or other content provided by Company, you may have the opportunity to click
  on links that take you outside Company's service to other websites or online
  content that are beyond Company's control. For example, you may encounter links
  to fan sites, webmaster program participant sites, or links from sponsors or
  partners, which may include Company's logo as part of a co-branding arrangement.
  If you "click" on the link to such a third party, the "click" takes
  you to a third party's website or online content.&nbsp; Company has no control
  over and is not responsible for the content of any third party sites to which
  you link.. In addition, these other websites have their own information collection
  and privacy protection practices that may differ from Company's, and we encourage
  you to review the privacy practices of any other website you visit.<br>
