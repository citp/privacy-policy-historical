Trackle also stores a small text file called a “<strong>Cookie</strong>” on your computer to store your login information (if any) and your personal preferences for the Trackle Services.

While you will still be able to use the Trackle Services if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the Trackle Services may not function as effectively.</p>

<p>Since the foregoing information may be collected when you are signed into the Trackle Services, this information may be associated by us with Personal Information that we have collected from you.</p>

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Trackle or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to Trackle sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.</p>
