Security

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that meet or exceed industry standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our Web site, using firewalls and other security technology to protect our network and systems from external attacks, and requiring you to enter a unique user name and password to access your account information online. Also, we utilize SSL to protect the privacy of the information which is communicated between your computer and our servers. 

You can always verify the identity of our web site because we use web server certificates which are signed by a trusted third party. 

Our employees (for example, customer service and compliance personnel) and third party service providers have access to your nonpublic personal information only on a "need to know" basis. We conduct regular internal audits of our business practices and procedures, examining confidentiality standards and information access in order to protect your personal information. 

In addition to our security measures, you can also take steps to maximize your security online and to protect your confidential information. First and foremost, don't choose a trivial password and don't post it on your computer. Don't use a public computer unless you can verify that it's not capturing key strokes and that you can erase all of your information from it once you've finished.
