## Data protection statement

**1\. Data processing on Transfermarkt's Internet pages**  
The security and protection of data is of special concern to Transfermarkt. Transfermarkt is committed to compliance with the legal provisions for data protection, in particular the German Federal Data Protection Act [Bundesdatenschutzgesetz] (BDSG) and the German Law on Data Protection for Teleservices [Gesetz über den Datenschutz bei Teledienstleistungen] (TDDSG). Transfermarkt uses special encryption techniques to protect your personal data. Transfermarkt collects, processes, and uses the personal data you provide in strict compliance with the data protection provisions in force and only for the purpose, for as long as, and to the extent required. Transfermarkt uses this data solely to enable you to use the Transfermarkt services for which registration is required and to inform you of Transfermarkt’s new products and services. No other purpose is connected with such use. 

**2\. Personal data**  
Personal data are those items of information that make it possible to identify you. They include, in particular, your name, date of birth, address, and telephone number. They do not include information that is not directly associated with your actual identity (such as favourite web pages or the number of users of a site). You can always use the website without disclosing your identity. If you register for the personalised services of Transfermarkt, you will be asked for your first and last name and a valid e-mail address. Transfermarkt stores this personal data only with your express consent. To be able to use the personalised services of Transfermarkt, you are required to submit your personal data to Transfermarkt. In connection with your access to Transfermarkt's websites, data by which it might be possible to identify you (for example, browser type/version, operating system used, referrer URL (the previously visited page), hostname of the accessing computer (IP address), time of the server request) are stored on the servers for security purposes. Transfermarkt uses this information to maintain service quality and to create general statistics on Transfermarkt. Transfermarkt may, for the performance of statistical analyses, disclose such data in anonymised form to partners. No use with reference to individual persons takes place. 

**3\. Disclosure of personal data to third parties**  
Transfermarkt will neither sell nor rent out your personal data, nor will it otherwise disclose it to third parties, including Axel Springer AG, without your prior written consent. In no event will Transfermarkt make your personal data known to third parties for promotional or marketing purposes or disclose it to third parties some other way. Transfermarkt is, however, entitled to disclose your personal data to third parties if, in the view of Transfermarkt, there is reason to suspect that the content transmitted by you infringes the rights of third parties and these third parties demand release of your personal data. Without your prior express consent, Transfermarkt will not use your personal data to inform you by post or e-mail of Transfermarkt’s new products and services. Should you decide to register as a member of the Transfermarkt network, then you yourself shall decide which of your personal data may be disclosed and to which other users of this network. 

**4\. Legal obligation to disclose data**  
Transfermarkt will convey your data to authorities entitled to receive such information if obligated to do so by law or court order. 

**5\. Employees of Transfermarkt**  
The employees of Transfermarkt are bound to secrecy with regard to personal data. Employees of Transfermarkt will disclose personal data to third parties only within the limits described above. 

**6\. Cookies**  
Transfermarkt uses cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identification characters that are temporarily stored in working memory (“session cookies”) or permanently saved to your computer's hard drive (“permanent cookies”). These cookies are deleted as soon as you log off from your personal account, or they expire on the cookie’s expiration date. 

**7\. Revocation with regard to the storage and use of personal data**  
You may at any time, effective for the future, revoke, in writing or electronically, your consent to storage of your personal data. If you wish to revoke your consent to storage of your personal data by Transfermarkt, please send an e-mail with the reference “Revocation” to Transfermarkt’s data protection officer, Mr. Sven Grothues, at the following e-mail address: datenschutz@transfermarkt.de. If you revoke your consent to storage of your personal data by Transfermarkt, your data will be deleted immediately. Transfermarkt does, however, reserve the right to block access to your personal data for a period of six months after receiving your revocation order instead of deleting it immediately. Transfermarkt will make use of this option particularly in the event that, in Transfermarkt’s view, there is reason to suspect that the rights of third parties might be violated by the content you transferred and that these third parties demand, or in the foreseeable future might demand, that Transfermarkt release your personal data. During this blocking period, Transfermarkt will use your personal data for no purpose other than the one just mentioned. 

**8\. Right to information**  
You have the right to receive at any time information regarding data stored by Transfermarkt in reference to you. Information on the stored data is provided by Transfermarkt's data protection officer, Mr. Sven Grothues. Please direct your requests in this regard to the following e-mail address: datenschutz@transfermarkt.de. 

**9\. Further information on data protection**  
Contributions to the discussion groups, forums, rumour mills, etc., are accessible to everyone. You should carefully inspect your contributions before publication for any information not intended for the public. You must expect that your contributions will appear in search engines and become accessible even without access directly to Transfermarkt’s websites. 

**10\. Data protection officer/contact for users' questions**  
Your trust is important to us. We would be pleased, therefore, to answer any questions you may have, beyond this Data Protection Statement, in relation to the use of your personal data. If you have questions that this Data Protection Statement cannot answer for you, or if you would like detailed information on a particular point, please feel free to consult Transfermarkt's data protection officer, Mr. Sven Grothues, at any time.
