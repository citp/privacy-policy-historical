    <td width="677" height="447" align="left" valign="top" class="superscript"> <p><strong><u>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</u></strong>: TradeStation Group Inc. and its subsidiary companies,  TradeStation Securities, Inc., TradeStation Technologies, Inc., and  TradeStation Europe, Ltd. (collectively referred to herein as “TradeStation”,  “our”, “us” or “we”) are committed to protecting the confidentiality and  security of information we collect about consumers and our customers. We will  not share nonpublic information about you ("Information") with third  parties outside of our securities affiliate’s clearing firm(s) without your  consent, except for the specific purposes described below. This notice  describes the Information we may gather and the circumstances under which we  may share it. Our securities affiliate’s clearing firm(s) should have an  additional separate privacy policy, which explains their privacy practices.</p>
      <p>        <strong><u>Why We Collect and How We Use Information</u></strong><strong>:</strong> We limit the collection and use of Information  to the minimum we require to deliver and improve service to you. Such service  includes processing transactions requested by you, providing you with trading  software analysis tools (and related educational, training and support), and  administering our business.</p>
      <p>        <strong><u>How We Gather Information</u></strong><strong>:</strong> We get most Information directly from you, when  you apply for, access and use financial (and related) products and services  offered by TradeStation through its affiliated companies and its business  partners—whether in person, by telephone or electronically.&nbsp; We may verify this information or get  additional information from consumer or investigative reporting agencies or  public sources. This Information may relate to your finances, employment,  avocations or other personal characteristics, as well as transactions and  interactions between or among our affiliated companies or others.&nbsp; The personal information we collect may  include your name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security  number and date of birth, as well as details about your professional  affiliations, net worth, income, investments and investment experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Web tools are used on our Web  site to help us monitor traffic patterns and to see how the user navigates  through our site.&nbsp; These Web tools are  used by us and our affiliates for internal purposes only and are not used to  collect or disseminate personal information to any third party.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <strong><u>How We Protect  Information</u></strong><strong>:</strong> We maintain physical,  electronic and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with industry  rules and regulations to guard your Information. Our  employees are required to protect the confidentiality of Information and to  comply with our established policies. They may access Information only when  there is an appropriate reason to do so, such as to administer our products or  services. We also maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to  protect Information which comply with all applicable laws. Employees who  violate our Privacy Policy are subject to disciplinary process.&nbsp; TradeStation offers a secure server with  password-protection.&nbsp; Secure Sockets  Layer (SSL) encryption is used to increase the protection of your information.&nbsp; SSL encodes and decodes the transmission of  personal information to help prevent interception by another party.&nbsp; We also use firewalls and other security  technology to help protect our network and systems from external attack.&nbsp; In addition to our efforts to protect  Information, you can also help to protect your identity.&nbsp; When using the Internet:&nbsp; keep your security software current and  turned on; protect your password information; shred personal documents; and  check your credit report regularly.&nbsp;  Remember that TradeStation will never request by email or similar  electronic means your account number, login password or Social Security Number,  so if you ever receive such a request via the Internet, it is not from us and  you should not provide any information.&nbsp;  If you have reason to believe that you have been the victim of identity  theft, immediately call our Client Service Department at (800) 822-0512 or (954) 652-7900. </p>
      <p>        <strong><u>Disclosure of Information</u></strong><strong>:</strong> We do not disclose any nonpublic  information about our customers or former customers to anyone, except as required  or permitted by law. We may disclose any Information to or as directed by our securities  affiliate’s clearing firm(s) or when we believe it necessary for the conduct of  our business, or where disclosure is required or permitted by law. Information  may be disclosed for audit or research purposes, to attorneys or other  professionals, or to law enforcement and regulatory agencies, for example, to help  us prevent fraud. In addition, we may disclose Information to affiliated and  non-affiliated third party service providers (i) to enable them to provide  business services for us or our securities affiliate’s clearing firm(s), such  as performing computer related or data maintenance or processing services, (ii)  to facilitate the processing of transactions requested by you, (iii) to assist  us in offering products and services to you or to assist our clearing firm in  offering products and services to you, or (iv) for credit or other background  review and reporting purposes. Except in those specific, limited situations,  without your consent we will not make any disclosures of Information to other  companies who may want to sell their products or services to you. For example,  we do not sell customer lists and we will not sell your name to a catalogue  company. It is TradeStation's policy to require all third parties that are to  receive any Information, other than our securities affiliate’s clearing  firm(s), to sign strict confidentiality agreements.<br>
        <br>
        <strong><u>Opt-Out Information</u></strong>:&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong><u>Non Affiliates:</u></strong>&nbsp; Current law allows you to limit the sharing  of Information with nonaffiliated third parties under certain  circumstances.&nbsp; Since we do not currently  share your Information with nonaffiliated third parties, other than as  described in this policy, there is no need for you to opt-out.</p>
      <p>        <strong><u>Affiliates:</u></strong>&nbsp; Current law allows you to limit the sharing of  certain Information among our affiliates, including creditworthiness  information and, under some circumstances, Information for marketing products  and services to you.&nbsp; We currently do not  share creditworthiness information with our affiliates so it is not necessary  for you to opt out in that regard.&nbsp; Sometimes  we do share your Information between and among our affiliates for marketing  offers which relate to products and services we believe could enhance or  improve your experience as our customer.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;You may ask us not to share your  Information, for marketing purposes, with any TradeStation affiliate with whom  you do not do business by following the opt-out procedure below.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> To opt out, contact our Client Service Department at (800) 822-0512 or (954) 652-7900. </p>
      <p> Your election to limit marketing offers from our  affiliates will apply unless and until you request that we change your choice.</p>
      <p><strong><u>State Considerations</u></strong>:&nbsp; The practices described above are in  accordance with federal law. You may have other protections under applicable  state laws, such as those in Vermont and Nevada. To the extent these state laws  apply, we will comply with them if we share your Information. For example,  Vermont law places additional limits on sharing Information about Vermont  residents so we will not share Information we collect about Vermont residents  to companies outside of TradeStation, except: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To companies that  perform marketing or other services on our behalf; </li>
        <li>Contact information  (like name and address), and transaction information (such as your payment  history) to other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing  agreements; </li>
        <li>With the authorization  or consent of the Vermont resident; or </li>
        <li>As permitted or required  by law. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nevada Law.&nbsp; At any time,  you may request to be placed on TradeStation’s internal do not call list.  Nevada law also requires that we provide you with the following contact  information: </p>
