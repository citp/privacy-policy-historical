<br>LAST REVISED: 08/16/2012<br>
<br>IMPORTANT: BY USING TRADEO LIMITED (“TRADEO”) WEBSITE “TRADEO.COM” ("SITE") AND SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW) YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY TRADEO IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
<br>At Tradeo.com, we recognize that your privacy is important. This Policy applies to all of the services and products offered by Tradeo or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, Tradeo's “Services”) and covers how personal and other information that Tradeo collects and receives, including information related to use of the Services, is treated.<br>
<br>If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@tradeo.com">privacy@tradeo.com</a></p></div><span class="up" title="Go To Top"></span></div><div class="section" id="24"><div class="separator"></div><h2>What information do we collect?</h2><div class="content"><p>When you sign up to become a registered user of Tradeo we request you to fill up the registration forms which include your name, address and email address, etc.<br>
<br>Tradeo enables you to share information with others in your Tradeo network. As a registered user of our Site, we will monitor, collect and maintain information about your membership activity from Tradeo and other social networks. This activity includes your trading ideas, messages, transactions, positions, history, comments, chats, subscriptions to other members as well as ratings of other members’ trading ideas and comments and their ratings of you. We publish this information and derivatives based on this information on our Site and we use this information to provide the services you have requested.<br>
<br>While providing you with privacy settings that you can use to restrict other users from accessing your information. We share your information with third parties when we believe the sharing is permitted by you, reasonably necessary to offer our services, or when legally required to do so.<br>
<br>When you use our Services, we automatically receive and record information from your computer, documents, and browser, including your IP address, cookie information, software and hardware attributes.</p></div><span class="up" title="Go To Top"></span></div><div class="section" id="26"><div class="separator"></div><h2>What do we use your information for?</h2><div class="content"><p>To provide the services and process transactions.<br>
<br>To help us improve or promote our Services. This may include promotional material which we will be providing our users as well as to internally help us improve our services and to resolve problems.<br>
<br>To provide Users with certain content that may be of interest to that user based on the information the user provides.<br>
<br>To create aggregate, non-personal, demographic reports about the users of the service and to generate aggregate statistical studies and conduct research related to the Services and the use of the Site.<br>
<br>To help improve or promote the service we provide, sometimes we share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information with third parties. But we only do so in such a way that no individual user can be identified or linked to any specific action or information. Tradeo will use such information provided by users to administer a site feature or to display statistics and analytics about the Tradeo network to both users and partners.<br>
<br>We may disclose information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our terms of use and privacy policy. This may include sharing information with our lawyers, trustees, courts and governmental.</p></div><span class="up" title="Go To Top"></span></div><div class="section" id="27"><div class="separator"></div><h2>How do we protect your information?</h2><div class="content"><p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to unrelated third parties your personally identifiable information, except as specifically otherwise indicated in this Privacy Policy. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. Tradeo may provide non-identifiable, general statistical and demographic information to third parties from time to time.<br>
<br>We limit access to personal information about you to employees, contractors and agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.<br>
<br>We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Database to be only accessed by those authorized with special access rights to our systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password protection.<br>
<br>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about our site.<br>
<br>Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.<br>
<br>Please contact us at the above address for any additional questions about our information security or the protection of personal data.</p></div><span class="up" title="Go To Top"></span></div><div class="section" id="43"><div class="separator"></div><h2>Sharing your information with third parties</h2><div class="content"><p>We do not share your information with third parties, except as permitted.
<br>Sharing your information with our Partnering Brokers: We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose your personally identifiable information as described in this Privacy Policy including the transfer of your first and last name, phone number and email address and any other relevant information,  to our partnering brokers, who may contact you and offer training and other services, including by mail or by phone.</p></div><span class="up" title="Go To Top"></span></div><div class="section" id="29"><div class="separator"></div><h2>You choose whether you want to make your performances public</h2><div class="content"><p>Choosing to make your information public is exactly what it sounds like: anyone, including people off of Tradeo, will be able to see it.<br>
<br>Choosing to make your information public also means that this information:<br>
<br>-- may be associated with you (i.e., your name, profile picture, Tradeo profile, User ID, etc.) even off Tradeo, may show up when someone does a search on you on a public search engine<br>
<br>-- may be accessible to the applications and websites you and your peers use<br>
<br>-- may be accessible to anyone who uses our APIs.<br><br>
<br>Sometimes you will not be able to select an audience when you post something (like when you write on a Page's wall or comment on a news article that uses our comments plugin). This is because some types of posts are always public posts. As a general rule, you should assume that if you do not see a sharing icon, the information will be publicly available.<br>
<br>-- Name: This helps other users, such as your friends and family, find you.<br>
<br>-- Profile Pictures: This helps your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable making your profile picture public, you can always delete it.<br>
<br>-- Username and User ID: These allow you to give out a custom link to your profile or Page.<br>
<br>-- Biography summary – a short description about yourself which you enter after creating an account.<br>
<br>A Username (or Tradeo URL) is a custom link to your profile that you can give out to people or post on external websites. If you have selected a username, it will always appear in the URL on your profile page. If you have not selected a username, then the URL on your profile page will contain your User ID, which is what we use to identify your Tradeo account.<br>
<br>If someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information about you through the Tradeo.com website. For example, if someone has your Username, they can type Tradeo.com/Username into their browser and see your public information as well as anything else you've let them see. Similarly, someone with your Username or User ID can access information about you through our APIs. Specifically, they can access your public information, along with your age range, locale (or language) and gender.</p></div><span class="up" title="Go To Top"></span></div><div class="section" id="32"><div class="separator"></div><h2>Do we use cookies?</h2><div class="content"><p>Yes.
