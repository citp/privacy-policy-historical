# Privacy Policy - Travel Portland

### Travel Portland Privacy Policy

**Original Effective Date: September 23, 2013;**  
**Last Updated: June 27, 2014**

This Privacy Policy describes how we treat user information we collect both online through our [www.travelportland.com](http://www.travelportland.com/) website (the “Site”) and offline, such as through phone or email interactions you have with us. The Site is brought to you by Travel Portland (referred to in this Policy as “Travel Portland,” “we,” “us,” and “our”).

### **1.    ** **Your agreement to this Policy**

Your use of the Site signifies that you have read, understand, and agree with all of the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree to all of the terms of this Policy, do not use the Site. You agree that this Policy is supported by reasonable and valuable consideration (including your use of the Site), the receipt and sufficiency of which you acknowledge. ****

### **2.    Information we collect**

**a.    Personally-Identifying Information.** When you use the Site, we collect personally-identifying information (hereafter, “Personal Information”) that you actively enter into the Site. We may also collect Personal Information from you through offline contacts, such as email or phone call. Personal Information may include your name, title, gender, address, phone number, email address, information about your past and future planned trips to Portland including information about specific travel arrangement details, work samples and information regarding your work as a freelance travel journalist or photographer, emergency contact information, health information such as health concerns and physical limitations, information about your company or organization, names of all guests that will attend an event, and whatever other personally-identifying information you actively enter into or upload onto the Site.

Further, when you use the Site, you may click on a link that will take you to another website (PayPal or ARES) that will collect Personal Information (including some of the types of Personal Information listed above and including financial information, such as credit card and billing address information). Some of this Personal Information may be provided to us in order to complete your transaction, but we will not be given your financial information. For example, if you want to purchase copies of our magazine, in order to complete your purchase, you will link to [www.paypal.com](http://www.paypal.com/), where you will input Personal Information, such as your name, billing and shipping address, phone number, email, and financial information and/or your PayPal account information, including your email and password. All of this Personal Information will be collected by PayPal and is subject to PayPal’s privacy policy. However, note that we will be given your address, other contact information, and product purchase information so we can fulfill your order, and this Personal Information, when in our possession, is subject to this Policy. When you use the ARES website to book travel accommodations, we may be given some of your Personal Information, but we will not be given your financial information submitted to book the accommodations. See more information about PayPal and ARES elsewhere in this Policy.

**b.    Automatically-Collected Information.** As you navigate, browse, and engage in activities on the Site, we automatically collect and store information about your visit to and use of the Site, such as:  The date and time of your visit, the duration of your visit, the type of browser and browser language you use, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) or MAC address, your mobile device ID, the type of computer or other operating device used, the actions you take on the Site (such as pages viewed and links clicked), the websites from which you linked to the Site, and the websites you visit after visiting the Site. We use this information in the aggregate to inform us regarding what services and Site features users purchase and look at most frequently. We also use this information as described elsewhere in this Policy. All information discussed in this Section 2(b) is referred to in this Policy as “Automatically-Collected Information.” Unless otherwise stated in this Policy or prohibited by law, Automatically-Collected Information may be combined with your Personal Information.

### **3.    We collect information in different ways**

You do not have to provide us with your Personal Information to browse the Site, and we only collect Personal Information when you voluntarily provide it. When you do provide us your Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with this Policy and to store your information on our servers located in the United States. ****

**a.    Forms. **Travel Portland employs the use of various forms. When you fill out and submit these forms on our Site, you provide Personal Information and Automatically Collected Information to us. Our forms include, but are not limited to:

(i) Event RSVPs

(ii) Magazine/brochure requests

(iii) General inquiries

(iv) Direct contact requests to Travel Portland staff/departments

(v) Credentialed media requests and requests for visual assets

(vi) RFP submissions

(vii) Partnership applications

**b.    Other Personal Information Collection.** We also collect Personal Information from you via phone call or email or that you enter into or upload onto the Site without use of a form. We will also obtain information you input into [www.paypal.com](http://www.paypal.com/) in order to purchase our products through that third-party site; we obtain information from PayPal that we need to process your order, but we will not be given your financial information. We may obtain information you input into the ARES site through the link <http://reservations.travelportland.com/3496_hotel-list_m1882_r207740.html> (note this is the ARES site), which information is relevant to your travel accommodations, but ARES will not provide us your financial information. You do not have to provide us with your Personal Information to browse the Site, and we only collect Personal Information when you voluntarily provide it. When you do provide us your Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with this Policy and to store your information on our servers located in the United States.

**c.    We gather Automatically-Collected Information from you passively.** We use commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect Automatically-Collected Information as you navigate the Site. This Section 3(c) describes in further detail the types of Automatically-Collected Information we may collect and how we may use this Automatically-Collected Information.

**            (i) Cookies.** The Site uses a feature of your Internet browser called “cookies” to make your interactions with the Site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Site, our servers send a cookie to your computer or other operating device. The cookie is placed on your hard drive or other operating device, and it assigns your computer or operating device a unique, random number that acts as a sort of anonymous ID. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; rather, a cookie identifies the computer or operating device used to access the Site. A cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us, such as by filling out a web form, you remain anonymous to us when browsing the Site; in other words, the cookie alone will not allow us to identify you personally.

There are two types of cookies: Session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer or operating device when you close your browser software or otherwise end your session. Persistent cookies remain on your computer or operating device after you close your browser or otherwise end your session. We use session cookies to provide us information about Site features used and activities conducted while using the Site. We also use persistent cookies so we can recognize your computer or other operating device when you return to the Site. We also use third-party persistent cookies to help us deliver advertising based on your online activity, as described in Section 3(c)(ii) below.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can disable the acceptance of cookies at any time by changing the preferences in your browser. Most browsers also allow you to change the settings to require that the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie. Please refer to your browser for information on how to disable and control cookies. If you disable your web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you may not be able to successfully use certain features of the Site. **Further, note that in order to stop receiving our advertisements based on your online activity, you will need to opt-out of this online tracking, as described immediately below.**

******            (ii) Third-party cookies and Site analytics; our targeted advertising practices. **We use third-party services, including Google Analytics provided by Google, Inc., to track and analyze your Site activity, as well as to track websites you visit after using the Site. We do not combine this Automatically-Collected Information with your Personal Information. In order to use these third-party services, we use a Google Analytics’ cookie on the Site. The information generated by the Google Analytics’ cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on Site activity for us, and providing other services relating to Site activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf.

We may also use other third-party services, such as Google AdWords and Google Display Network, to serve online advertisements to you on other websites after you’ve visited the Site. This practice is known as remarketing, and you will see our advertisements across the Internet unless you opt-out, as discussed below. We, along with third-party vendors, Google and DoubleClick, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics’ cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and deliver advertisements based on your online activity, including your past visits to the Site. If you would like to learn more about this program, you can do so [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2611268?hl=en&topic=2611283&ctx=topic).[  
](file:///S:/Marketing/Ellen/Travel%20Portland%20Privacy%20Policy%20\(EW%20Revised%20June%202014\).docx#_msocom_2)

If you would like to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising like this from Google, you can manage these settings by visiting the [Google Ads settings page](http://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TChq-lgYD5cFUXRLkAeBKdm9UV0XosRrsq3W_HXXo2MiNsC73tDC01me7-ZjwMmQbzbhpGB7BlIKhUpzlZBLnWq1v3yZTROZN8xE-cZFQzofIHtQPAFuoKxdyS2jdnwx_P-apaF6Qwjhl6gkMRcER84nACrkgMqYWKP1BB5UVdECQ6wOc5w). Also, Google recommends installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Ad-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). Alternatively, you can opt-out by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices). Note that even if you opt-out, you may still see our advertisements, but they will not be delivered based on your online activity.

The advertisements described in this Section are different from marketing communications you will receive if you are on our promotional mailing list, discussed in Section 6 below.

**             (iii) Web beacons. **We use web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile Automatically-Collected Information about your use of the Site, as well as your interaction with emails from us. Web beacons are clear electronic images embedded in a web page, website feature, or email, which can recognize certain types of information on your computer or other operating device, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon. For example, we may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify us when you click on a link in the email that directs you to the Site. We use web beacons to operate and improve the Site and email communications and to statistically monitor how many people are using the Site and opening our emails and for what purposes. We do not collect Personal Information with web beacons.  ****

**             (iv) IP addresses** **and mobile device IDs.** When you visit the Site, we collect your IP address and mobile device ID to track and aggregate Automatically-Collected Information.

### **4.    We use your information as described here**

a.   We use your Personal Information to respond to your requests or questions, to fulfill orders for magazines, and to otherwise perform the services you request. We may also use your Personal Information to send you transactional communications, such as emails about this Policy or to provide required notices or notices about your transactions.

b.   We use your Personal Information for marketing purposes, as described in Sections 3(ii) and 6 below.

c.   We use Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information to improve our Site and services; to help diagnose problems with the Site; and to analyze statistical use patterns and demographic data. For example, we might use your Personal Information and/or Automatically-Collected Information to customize your experience on the Site, which could include displaying content based upon your preferences or activities conducted on the Site. We might use Automatically-Collected Information to track what Site users look at most frequently so we can recognize and deliver more of the desired content. We may combine Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information we get from you with information about you that we get from third parties.

d.   We use Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information as otherwise described in this Policy and as otherwise permitted by law.

### **5.    We may share your information with third parties, as described here.**

**a.      ****Purchases; travel accommodations.** Remember, if you purchase product through PayPal or if you book travel accommodations through ARES, you will be sharing your information with PayPal and/or ARES, respectively, and your information is subject to PayPal’s and ARES’ privacy policies. If you book hotel stays, ARES will share your personal information with the applicable hotel. See additional information regarding PayPal and ARES in Sections 7 and 8 below.

**b.      ****Third-party service providers.** We may share your Personal Information with our third-party service providers so that they can contact you on our behalf to perform certain services for us, perform certain marketing on our behalf, and/or perform Site analytics services, as described above, or other services relating to the operation of the Site (such as hosting, data storage, and security). We may also share Personal Information of our users with our service providers to ensure the quality of information provided. These third-party service providers are not authorized to use your information in any way other than as described in this Policy and are required to keep the information confidential. Note this paragraph does not apply to PayPal or ARES. If you use PayPal’s and/or ARES’ sites and services, your information is subject to PayPal’s and ARES’ privacy policies, and you should read those policies to learn how PayPal and ARES use your information.

**c.       ****Merger, acquisition, or sale.** We may share or transfer Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information to a third-party successor to all or any part of our business. In this event, we will, if allowed, use reasonable efforts to notify you when your information is shared with or transferred to any third party by posting such notice on the Site and/or by contacting you via the Personal Information you have provided us, if any.

**d.      ****Required by law.** We reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, rule, regulation, judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or similar legal process; if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to protect, establish, or exercise our rights or property, or to defend against legal claims; or if we reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our other Site users or our employees, property, or business, or to take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud.

**e.       ****De-identified information.** We may share de-identified, aggregated Automatically-Collected Information without restriction.

**f.     Public areas of the site. **The Site contains areas where users can post content that will be viewed by other users.

Users must opt in to any of our e-newsletters and other marketing communications, and any information collected in the subscription process is never shared with or sold to any third party for such third party’s marketing purposes, though we may otherwise share your information as described in Section 5 above. There are also other locations where you may opt-in to receiving marketing communications from Travel Portland. If you opt-in to receiving marketing communications from Travel Portland, you agree you may receive marketing communications from us via telephone calls, physical mail, e-newsletters, e-mails that are not e-newsletters, and text messages. Also, note that our marketing communications may pertain to our own promotions, offers, events, products, or services, but they may also pertain to third-party offers, products, or services we think you might find interesting (the third parties will not send you the communications; rather, we may send you communications regarding third-party offers, products, or services).

Travel Portland works with an outside vendor in the fulfillment of our e-newsletters and for some other marketing communications. This vendor only uses your contact information to send you marketing communications on our behalf. Our vendor’s full privacy policy is available here: <http://www.act-on.com/privacy-policy>

At any time, you may request that we stop sending you for marketing communications by contacting us at the contact information below or unsubscribing from  marketing communications. All of our e-newsletters and marketing e-mails include links in the footer of the e-mail for managing all aspects of your subscription, including the ability to globally unsubscribe from all marketing communications. If you request that we not contact you for marketing purposes (either by using the unsubscribe mechanism or by otherwise contacting us), we reserve the right to contact you for non-marketing purposes relating to your use of the Site.

### **11\. We store** **Information in the United States**

If you live outside of the United States, you understand and agree that we may transfer your Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information to the United States. The Site is subject to U.S. laws, which may not afford you the same level of protection as the laws in your country. The Site is controlled and operated from the United States and is not intended to (and shall not be deemed to) subject us to non-U.S. jurisdiction or laws. The Site may not be appropriate for use in some jurisdictions outside of the United States, and use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all of the provisions of this Policy.

### **12\. Retention**

You can contact us via the contact information below and ask us to remove your information from our databases. Note that even after you ask us to remove your information from our databases, it may be impossible to remove some information, such as information tracked in our web server log files and information that may reside in backup files. This residual information is retained to preserve the integrity of our files. We may also retain Automatically-Collected Information even after you request that we remove your information from our databases, for use in the aggregate and to analyze and improve the Site. Further, even after you request that we remove your information from our databases, we may retain Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information to comply with any applicable law, rule, regulation, or guideline; to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability; and to allow us to enforce our contractual or other rights and to pursue available remedies and limit any damages we may sustain.

### **13.** **Security; Disclaimer**

We use standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration of Personal Information and Automatically-Collected Information that is under our control. The standard security measures we take will depend on the type of information collected.

We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. Please do not send us sensitive information via email as this is not secure. Please notify us if you become aware that your Personal Information is lost, stolen, or used without permission.

Unfortunately, no data storage system or system of transmitting data over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and no security system can prevent all security breaches. As a result, we do not and cannot guarantee the security of our servers or any Personal Information or Automatically-Collected Information provided to us. **Any transmission of your information to us is at your own risk.**

### **14\. Linked Websites**
