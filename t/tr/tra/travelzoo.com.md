### Travelzoo's Privacy Practices 

Travelzoo Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for Travelzoo's Media Products.

Travelzoo publishes various e-mail newsletters. Users can sign up for newsletters from our home page by providing their first name, e-mail address, and zip code. This information will not be shared with third parties. Recipients can edit their personal information or manage newsletter subscriptions by visiting the [ edit profile](http://www.travelzoo.com/profiles) page. Information on how to unsubscribe is also included in every newsletter. 

Travelzoo may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. The cookie is a small text file that resides on your hard drive. It may be used to retrieve stored information that you knowingly provided us such as name, e-mail address and zip code in order to personalize your use of Travelzoo's Media Products. 

Some Travelzoo advertisers may use “view-through” pixels to track the effectiveness of the promotions they run on Travelzoo. Such pixels may lead to cookies being placed on your computer by these advertisers. Travelzoo does not have access to any personally identifiable information about you as a result of these cookies. 

Travelzoo may track individual user response (clicks) on offers on its Media Products. This information may be used to better customize content and advertising for you in the future. Individual user click behavior is not shared with third parties. 

Travelzoo reserves the right to send you certain communications relating to Travelzoo’s service or products, including administrative messages, market research surveys, and periodic product announcements associated with your newsletter or e-mail product subscription(s), as long as you remain a subscriber to one of our newsletters or e-mail products. Your voluntary response to market research surveys may be used to improve our products and services and for anonymous, aggregate reporting for internal and external clients.

From time to time Travelzoo may announce voluntary promotional programs which may include promotional incentives for subscribers. These programs may require personally identifiable information (ex: name, mailing address or frequent flyer account numbers) to be submitted for those subscribers who wish to participate. This information may be shared, upon the explicit opt-in of the subscriber, with external third parties for the purpose of fulfilling the promotional components of the program, for example with an airline for the awarding of frequent flyer miles to a subscriber’s account. Subscribers who do not wish this information to be disclosed to third parties may decline participation in these optional programs. Any promotional program which includes the sharing of information with a third party will have such a disclosure clearly described in the program’s description and rules. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. IP addresses are not associated with any use of our Media Products.

The Site includes a Service Center for Travelzoo shareholders. This section is password-protected. The features allow shareholders to update their contact information (e-mail address and mailing address). This information will not be shared with third parties. 

Advertising customers can contact advertising sales by filling out a form. This form asks for their name, company name, phone, fax, and e-mail. This is an optional feature. This information will not be shared with any third parties. 

Travelzoo has security measures in place to protect user information under our company's control against loss, misuse, or alteration. Access to private and confidential data is limited to only those employees with a specific need to retrieve this information. Data is stored on multiple server systems and written to tapes. All server systems are located in a secure, limited access Class A facility complete with environmentally controlled conditions, raised floors, and dry sprinkler systems.

Please be aware that Travelzoo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Travelzoo encourages our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

Travelzoo reserves the right to add to or modify this Policy simply by posting such addition or modification on the Travelzoo Web site. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail or via a prominent notice on our site.
