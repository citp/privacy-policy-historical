<b>Email Addresses Stored on TravelPod</b>
</font></p><p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica">

A valid concern raised by TravelPod users is "What does TravelPod do with the email addresses I put on the site?". A valid concern indeed. <br><br>

There are 2 sets of email addresses which TravelPod stores, member addresses and addresses on TravelPod member notification lists ( Address Books ). 
<br><br>

The email address of the member is used to send the member warnings, alerts, information about their travelogue and it's usage. Examples of emails which TravelPod sends it's members are:
<br><br>
- TravelPod will send a member an email when a guest unsubscribes or subscribes to their travelogue
<br>
- TravelPod can send a member their password, if forgotten, to their email address.
<br><br>
Most features which involve a member's email address can be disabled.
<br><br>

Aside from internal usage, the email address is never provided to any external parties for any purpose and is considered strictly confidential.<br><br>

The other set of email addresses stored on TravelPod are the notification emails addresses. These addresses are stored on TravelPod in a member's address book which can later be used to email a notification of an update to their travelogue. These addresses are never released outside of TravelPod nor are they ever used for marketing purposes of ANY kind. TravelPod members can be at be assured that the confidentiality of the addresses on their lists is strictly enforced.<br><br>

<b>Bottom line:</b> Any addresses provided to TravelPod, stay within TravelPod and are <b>NEVER</b> used for any non-ethical purposes nor is it ever provided to any external parties.
