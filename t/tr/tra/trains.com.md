# Trains.com: Privacy Policy

**PRIVACY POLICY**

**Trains.com** is committed to providing service that exceeds the expectations of site visitors and those who register for our services or conduct e-commerce via our web site. This commitment extends to the expectations you may have about maintaining your privacy and that of the members of your family, when it comes to use of any "personally identifiable information" you may provide.

We believe it is important to explain our information gathering practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used, including any personally identifiable information which **trains.com** 's business partners may share with us. Our policy naturally does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control or to any persons whom we do not employ or manage. Although **trains.com** is affiliated with Kalmbach Publishing Co., **trains.com** 's privacy policy is separate and distinct from Kalmbach's.

To make this notice easy to find, it is prominently displayed on our home page and at each place where personally identifiable information may be provided. This explanation of our privacy policy answers the following questions:

  * How and what kinds of information does **trains.com** collect?
  * How is this information used?
  * What can site visitors and those who register for our services do to retain their privacy?
  * What special policies, precautions and safeguards are employed with regard to children?



**Gathering Information**

Personally identifiable information is collected by us when you register for our services, decide to place an order (personally or as gifts for others), enter a contest, participate in a survey, or make a general inquiry. We may also receive personally identifiable information you have volunteered to one of our business partners. The information requested when you register with us may include the following: name, address, zip code, phone / fax number, age or date of birth, and e-mail address. If you elect to place an order with one of our business partners, participating merchants, or advertisers, you will need to volunteer additional fulfillment-related necessities, including shipping preferences and credit card information. With regard to surveys or contests in which you elect to participate, we may request additional demographic information along with basic information regarding your reading, hobby, or personal interests and how **trains.com** or our business partners may better serve those needs. Name, address and other contact information may be collected so that we can respond to any customer service issue, request for information or other general inquiry, along with (of course) information about the nature of your inquiry.

It is important for you to understand that no personally identifiable information is captured or retained unless you directly volunteer it. Once volunteered, you are not anonymous to us. When you access our web site, our server passively and automatically logs your IP address, **trains.com** "cookie" information, and the page you requested. "Cookies" are used to promote ease of access and communication among web addresses. We may set and access cookies on your computer, and we may allow business partners presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is, of course, subject to their own privacy policies and not ours.

**Uses of Information**

The fundamental (and essential) use of the information we collect is to respond and fulfill your needs as a web site visitor, registrant or customer. In other words, the information is necessary and is used to transact the e-commerce you wish to conduct via our site, to fulfill your desire to enter a contest, to acknowledge your interest in participating in a survey, or to resolve the customer service matter or other inquiry you have brought to our attention. We also use the information to contact you about specials and new products, to tailor the advertising and content you see on our pages according to your interests. On occasion—and only for those who are 13 years or older—your personally identifiable information may be made available to other reputable companies or organizations for marketing or information gathering purposes. You may request to be excluded from all such promotional efforts by contacting us directly or by taking other proactive measures, as specified below.

Demographic and other information volunteered in connection with surveys are used primarily for internal purposes to improve our responsiveness and/or that of our business partners, participating merchants and advertisers to your wants, needs, interests, opinions and suggestions. On occasion, the aggregate findings and results of such surveys may be published as a matter of general interest to the respondent groups who provided the information, and/or for the benefit of trade associations or others who may occasionally sponsor such surveys. In all such cases, the aggregate findings and results are reported "blind" without identifying any individuals from whom the data was collected.

**Maintaining Your Personal Privacy and Security**

All personally identifiable information, which you provide, is password-protected for your privacy and security. All data transmission of credit card information sent by you to us or forwarded by us to participating merchants for fulfillment purposes is "encrypted" using industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. "Encryption" is used to prevent the information from being intercepted.

**Opting Out**

At the time you volunteer personally identifiable information—and at anytime thereafter—you can direct us not to use this information for marketing or informational mailings or to otherwise share this information with business partners, participating merchants, advertisers or other reputable third parties. If you do so, your personally identifiable information will be flagged in our system as "do not promote" to correspond with your request. The easiest way to do this is to go to our home page, select the "update profile" option, and answer "no" to the question that pertains to the use of your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.

You can also "opt out" by sending such directions to **trains.com** , c/o Kalmbach Publishing Co., P.O. Box 1612, Waukesha WI 53187-1612, or simply e-mail us at [customerservice@kalmbach.com](mailto:customerservice@kalmbach.com). You can also reach us by calling toll-free, 888-350-2413, 8:30am—5:00pm Central Time, Monday—Friday. Outside the US and Canada, call 262-796-8776, ext. 826. The fax number is 262-796-1615.

In addition, there are also national clearinghouse organizations where you can register to suppress unwanted postal, electronic mail and telephone solicitations by third parties that have obtained your personally identifiable information. The most prominent of these is the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), of which **trains.com** is a member. The DMA provides mail, e-mail and telephone database "preference services" free of charge to consumers who wish to block unsolicited direct mail, e-mail and telemarketing contacts, respectively. For more information, visit DMA's web site at www.the-dma.org, or contact them at (202) 955-5030.

**Special Privacy Protections and Safeguards for Children**

Certain areas of our site are designed specifically for minors, including children under the age of 13, for whom special privacy provisions are applicable, as set forth by the Federal Trade Commission.

**Trains.com** encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on our sites. Although we also encourage and specifically direct all children to please ask your parents for permission before sending any information about yourself over the Internet, it is not possible—within the capability of current technology—for anyone to know for certain who is transacting business with them online. We cannot and do not ask minors to provide or disclose more information than is necessary from any other visitor or customer in their dealings with us.

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, **trains.com** does not use or provide any personally identifiable information from registrants under the age of 13 for marketing or promotional purposes, except as may be explicitly stated during registration for specific contests or promotions; and if that is the case, the information is used only for that specific contest or promotion.
