		<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
		<p>When you visit the AEP Websites, we or our <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> collect information, including <a href="#def_pii">PII</a> that you provide, in order to provide you with the products and services you requested or with offers or promotions that may interest you, service your accounts, and save you time and better respond to your needs.</p>
		<p>We use "<a href="#def_cookie">Cookie</a>" technology to collect Website statistical information and to improve your customer experience with the AEP Websites. <a href="#def_cookie">Cookies</a> set by AEP do not capture any <a href="#def_pii">PII</a>. However, if you choose to furnish us with <a href="#def_pii">PII</a>, this information may be linked to the data stored in the <a href="#def_cookie">Cookie</a> to further enhance your experience with our Websites. For example, we may use <a href="#def_cookie">Cookies</a> to personalize your experience at our Websites (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our Websites), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Websites. We also may use <a href="#def_cookie">Cookies</a> to offer you products, programs, or services.</p>
		<p>When browsing the AEP Websites, you may choose not to provide us with any <a href="#def_pii">PII</a>, such as by choosing not to register or to login. When you browse in this way, we will not link your <a href="#def_cookie">Cookie</a> information with the account(s) you may have with AEP.</p>
		<p>We or our <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> also automatically collect some statistical data as you browse our Websites. For example, we automatically collect your "<a href="#def_ip_address">IP Address</a>" used to connect your computer to the Internet, browser type and version, operating system and platform, average time spent on our Websites, pages viewed, information searched for, access times, "<a href="#def_clickstream_data">Clickstream Data</a>," and other relevant information about your online experience.</p>
		<p>AEP may also use "<a href="#def_web_beacon">Web Beacons</a>" to present offers on the AEP Websites, or other websites on which AEP advertises. In addition, e-mail offers that we send you may contain Web Beacons to help us record response rates, assist in measuring the offer's effectiveness, and/or generally enhance the relevance of e-mail offers. We sometimes use <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> to manage <a href="#def_web_beacon">Web Beacons</a> and the data they collect; however, <a href="#def_web_beacon">Web Beacons</a> do not capture any <a href="#def_pii">PII</a> that you enter on the AEP Websites.</p>
		<p>We or our <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> also collect information, including <a href="#def_pii">PII</a>, that you provide via telephone, traditional mail, e-mail, in person, or otherwise.</p>
		<p>At some AEP Websites and through certain promotions, you can submit information, including <a href="#def_pii">PII</a>, about other people. For example, if you order a gift online or offline and want it sent directly to the recipient, we might collect the recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.</p>

		<h2>How We Use and Share The Information We Collect</h2>
		<p>AEP uses the information we or our <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> collect about you and others, including <a href="#def_pii">PII</a>, to complete transactions, respond to your requests, deliver the products and services in which you enroll or request, and notify you of updates, products, services, offers, or promotions that may interest you. We may process or combine your information with other information that is publicly available. This enables us to customize your customer experience and provide you with more relevant offers. AEP may also use the information that we or our <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> collect from you online and via other means to market to you through alternative channels.</p>
		<p>AEP may share your information within our American Express family of companies. To provide products and services to you or offers that may interest you, we may also share your information with carefully selected <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> with whom we work. This includes companies that manage accounts and companies that perform marketing services and other business operations for us. All companies that act on our behalf are required to safeguard <a href="#def_pii">PII</a>.</p>
		<p>AEP may share your information with "<a href="#def_business_partner">Business Partners</a>" carefully selected by us that may wish to offer you products or services that may interest you, either in conjunction with AEP or by themselves.</p>
		<p>We may also use or disclose your information, including <a href="#def_pii">PII</a>, to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process, or as otherwise permitted by law; to report or collect debts owed; to reduce fraud or criminal activity; to protect the legal rights of AEP, our customers, our Websites, or the users of our Websites; or to allow a purchaser of an AEP division, or AEP as a whole, to continue using your information to serve you or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Statement.</p>

		<h2>Using Your E-Mail Address</h2>
		<p>We may use your e-mail address for the following types of e-mail messages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Account Service Communications.</strong> We may send you communications related to AEP products and services in which you are enrolled (e.g., subscription and membership communications).</li>
			<li><strong>Updates and Valuable Offers.</strong> We may send you e-mail account updates, offers for our products and services, requests for enrollment, as well as valuable offers from our <a href="#def_business_partner">Business Partners</a> that we send you on their behalf. </li>
			<li><strong>Regularly Scheduled E-mail Newsletters</strong> that you elected to receive.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can also elect to receive other types of e-mail messages from us, including alerts and notifications.</p>

		<h2>Advertisements That Link to Our Websites</h2>
		<p>AEP hires <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> to place advertisements on the AEP Websites and our banner advertisements on other websites, and to perform tracking and reporting activities on the AEP Websites and other websites. This enables us to learn which advertisements and websites bring users to our Websites and to improve the user experience. <a href="#def_cookie">Cookies</a> are used to assist with these activities. In doing so, a unique <a href="#def_cookie">Cookie</a> is placed on your computer either by us or a <a href="#def_vendor">Vendor</a> in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement.</p>
		<p>This Privacy Statement does not cover any use of information that such <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> may have collected from you or the methods used by them to collect that information. Rather, such <a href="#def_vendor">Vendors</a> have their own privacy policies. If you would like more information about their privacy policies, including information on how to opt out of their tracking methods, please visit <a href="/privacy/optout/thirdparty">this link</a>.</p>

		<h2>Transfers of Information to Other Countries</h2>
		<p>Some of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Statement may involve the transfer of your <a href="#def_pii">PII</a> to various countries around the world. By submitting your <a href="#def_pii">PII</a> to AEP via an AEP Website or otherwise, you consent to such transfers.</p>

		<p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your <a href="#def_pii">PII</a> from unauthorized access and use.
