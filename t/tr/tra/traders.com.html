<h1>Traders.com Privacy Statement</h1>
<p>Many of our readers are concerned about privacy on the Internet. Because we gather certain types of information about the users of Traders.com, we want you to understand how we collect and use that information. By reading this document, you will learn what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.
</p><p>Questions regarding this statement should be directed to Traders.com (Webmaster@Traders.com) for clarification. To return to the page you came from, please use the Back button on your browser.
</p><p><b><i>What Traders.com Gathers</i></b>
</p><p>Traders.com gathers two types of information about users: data that users provide through optional, voluntary registration and in certain contests and sweepstakes; and data that Traders.com collects through accumulated tracking information primarily derived by tallying page views throughout our sites. This data helps us to better tailor our site to your needs and gives our advertisers a better understanding of the demographics of our audience. Because Traders.com derives an important portion of its revenue from advertising, supplying these data to advertisers makes it possible to provide much of Traders.com's services to users at no cost.
</p><p>Traders.com gathers user information in the following ways:
</p><p><b>Optional registration</b>
<br>Users who want to use Message-Boards.Traders.com are asked to register if they wish to post a message. Registration is free and voluntary.
</p><p>During registration the user is required to supply a user name, password, and E-mail address, and may be asked to answer additional survey questions.
</p><p>In addition, the user may opt to subscribe to the TECH TRADERS electronic newsletter and to have his or her E-mail address and/or URL appear in postings.
</p><p><b>Surveys</b>
<br>Occasionally, Traders.com conducts user surveys to better match our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners.
</p><p><b>Usage tracking</b>
<br>It's important that we know who is on our site, and so we do our best to track you. We do not use the information we gather to build files about individual users. Traders.com gathers usage information based on a user's domain name, browser, and MIME type by reading the data
from the browser string (which is contained in every user's browser).
</p><p><b>Cookies</b>
<br>Traders.com creates a cookie when you visit, as do many Websites. A cookie is a small datafile containing information that makes it easy for you to use the site, such as a user ID code. We can also use cookies to track which pages you look at on our site. The only personal information in the cookie is data you may enter, and Traders.com cannot read a cookie created for use on a different Website.
</p><p>If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.
</p><p>To refuse cookies, disable cookies in your browser's preferences. You do not need to have cookies enabled to use Traders.com; however, you will need cookies enabled to participate actively in Message-Boards.Traders.com and Technical.Traders.com.
</p><p><b><i>Using the information</i></b>
</p><p>The main purpose of gathering information about users is to provide you with a better experience at both Traders.com and in the various publications of Technical Analysis, Inc. We will occasionally use that information to send a copy of our E-mail newsletter when we think it is of special value.
</p><p>Our tracking data is only used to gauge the effectiveness of the pages used by our Website visitors and not individual users. We do not keep track of which terms a particular user might enter in our "search" module. Nor do we give a particular advertiser data on which individual users have selected their ad.
</p><p><b><i>Sharing the information</i></b>
</p><p>The information we gather is used to make our site more valuable to you. By making Traders.com an interesting and valuable place to visit, we can charge for advertising and keep much of the site free. Information gathered is sometimes shared with third parties, when that party offers a product or service of value to our users.
</p><p><b><i>Opting out</i></b>
</p><p>When possible, Traders.com will give you the chance to opt out of our data process. You may choose not to receive our E-mail newsletters; you may choose not to provide certain personal information when registering for a site; you may choose to not participate in interactive areas requiring personal information.
</p><p><b><i>Corrections, deletions, and updates</i></b>
</p><p>Currently, Traders.com does not offer users a means by which to completely delete personal information established at the time of registration. If you believe we have the wrong information about you in our database, E-mail Webmaster@Traders.com.
</p><p>Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at any time by following the instructions contained at the end of every newsletter.
