# Privacy (Department of Transport and Main Roads)

## Privacy and security statement

### Respecting your privacy

The _Information Privacy Act 2009_ (IP Act) regulates the way in which Queensland government agencies must manage personal information. It addresses concerns about any unauthorised use of this information and gives individuals a right of access to personal information held about them. 

Like other Queensland government agencies, the Department of Transport and Main Roads is required to comply with 11 Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) contained in the IP Act. These IPPs set out how personal information must be collected, stored, used and disclosed.

The IP Act defines personal information as:

> _..”information or an opinion, including information or an opinion forming part of a database, whether true or not and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion.”_

For information to be personal information 2 criteria must be satisfied.

  1. It must be about a living individual. 
  2. The individual’s identity must be apparent or reasonably ascertainable from the information.

The departments’ Information Privacy Management Plan takes into consideration the diverse range of activities and functions of the department, and provides an overview for how compliance with the IP Act is achieved. This plan also provides a guideline for employees and contractors of the department who deal with personal information in relation to the functions and activities of the department.
