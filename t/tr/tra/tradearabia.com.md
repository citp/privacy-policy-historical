## Co-Branded Relationships 

We have established relationships with other parties to offer you the benefit of other products and services which we ourselves do not offer.

In some cases you may be required to submit information for purposes of registering or applying for products or services provided by such third parties or co-branded partners. The privacy policy of such other parties may differ from ours, and we may not have any control over the information that you submit to such third parties or co-branded sites. We therefore encourage you to read that policy before responding to any offers, products or services provided by such other parties. 

## Cookies

## Minors
