# Privacy Policy

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to describe how any data that you may send via the Internet to the website of Synthesis Bank (hereafter the "Website" and the "Bank" respectively) is treated and to explain all the reasonable precautions of the Bank to keep the data secure. 

### Data transfer to the Bank and trans-border data flows

Data sent via the Internet can be accessed by unauthorised third parties, potentially leading to disclosures, changes in content or technical failures. Data sent via the Internet may be transmitted across international borders even though both sender and receiver are located in the same country. Therefore, your data may be forwarded to a country with a lower data protection level than exists in your country of residence. The Bank accepts no liability for the security of the data whilst in transit via the Internet to the Bank.

### Processing of data by the Bank

The Bank does not collect personally identifying data from the Website except when specifically and knowingly provided by you. Your personal data shall be held on our contact and administration databases either because of the trading you have done or are currently engaged in, or because the Bank may use, subject to any applicable foreign laws, your personal data to market products and services it believes might be of interest to you.

The Bank may also collect data that is statistical and that does not, by itself, identify a specific individual or entity and which depends upon the visiting you do on the Website. For example, this data may include the domain from which you access the Website, the date and time you access the Website and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Website. This data is used in aggregate form for the compiling of statistical information and the monitoring of the usage and performance of the Website.

### Data security

The Bank follows strict security procedures in the storage of your personal data in order to prevent unauthorised access. However, the Website contains links to other websites. The Bank does not control and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites. The Bank shall take all reasonable steps in order not to allow your personal data to be seen by any third parties other than those which have been engaged by the Bank to provide services to you. The Bank will only disclose your personal data to other third partie, if compelled to do so for legal or regulatory purposes.
