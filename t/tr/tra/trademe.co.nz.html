<h1>Trade Me Privacy Policy</h1>
Trade Me has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm
commitment to privacy. This document discloses our information gathering and
usage practices. For additional information about Trade Me, please review our <a href="/structure/helpdocs/terms_and_conditions.asp">
Terms and Conditions</a>.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Use of your information</b><br>
Trade Me <b>does not</b> sell or rent your personal identification to third
parties.
<br>
<br>
We release account and other personal information only when we believe release
is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our terms and conditions;
or protect the rights, property, or safety of Trade Me Limited, our users, or
others.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Email</b><br>
It is the policy of Trade Me to send our members email throughout the auction
process and other email they elect to receive, in addition to customary
business communications (payment confirmations, etc.). Further, it is our
policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's
request. In addition, Trade Me will send a monthly newsletter to members.
Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can
remove himself or herself from that mailing list.
<br>
<br>
We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we
encourage you to <a href="/Help/ContactUs.aspx">email us</a> with your
questions or comments.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Emailing Tools</b><br>
Trade Me provides facilities throughout the site to refer a friend to Trade Me
or to send references to a specific listing to a friend. You may not use the
"Email This Auction to a Friend" service or other email forwarding services
that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our
privacy policy or <a href="/structure/helpdocs/terms_and_conditions.asp">Terms and
Conditions</a>. We do not permanently store, sell, or rent these email
messages or the email addresses.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Membership Registration</b><br>
Our site's registration form requires you to provide us contact information and
may also require demographic information. We may use your contact information
from the registration form to send you information about our company and
promotional material from some of our affiliated partners. Your contact
information is also used to contact you when necessary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Updating Your Personal Information</b><br>
Trade Me provides you with ways in which you can alter your personal data,
including changing your email address, password, phone number, etc. Trade Me
will store previous email addresses against your profile to ensure compliance
with our <a href="/structure/helpdocs/terms_and_conditions.asp">Terms and
Conditions</a> - specifically the use of one account per member.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Delivery Address Details</b><br>
Trade Me enables you to save one or more of your delivery addresses which we
will store against your profile. When you buy an item you have the option of
selecting a delivery address which we will then send to the seller. We will
never give the seller your address without your permission.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Payment Instructions Setup</b><br>
Trade Me enables you to save and send a standard payment instructions email to
the successful buyer when your auction ends. When you set up each auction you
can choose to have the saved message sent automatically or edit your message at
that time.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Control of Your Password</b><br>
You are responsible for all actions taken with your user name, email address
and password, including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose
your Trade Me password to any third parties. If you choose to share your user
name, email address and password or your information with third parties to
provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with
this information and therefore you should review that third party's privacy
policy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Credit Card Security</b><br>
We work diligently to protect the security of your personal information,
including credit card information.
<br>
<br>
We protect your credit card information during transmission by using Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. When paying
by credit card, you can choose to "save this card for next time". If you choose
this option, your credit card details are encrypted and securely stored by
Direct Payment Solutions (DPS). <a href="/structure/helpdocs/dps_privacy_policy.pdf">
Review their Privacy Policy</a> (PDF document). Your credit card details
are not held by Trade Me and can not be accessed by Trade Me staff.
<br>
<br>
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password
and to your computer by ensuring you logoff when you have finished visiting
Trade Me using a shared computer.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related
file on your computer's hard drive when you use our Web site. We use cookies to
improve the member experience. We also use them to deliver information and
fresh content specific to your interests. Cookies are widely used on most major
Web sites.
<br>
<br>
Trade Me mostly uses "session" cookies, which are removed from your computer
once you leave Trade Me. These are used so our service can remember that you
have logged in already and prevent you doing so more frequently. The technology
we use (Microsoft Active Server Pages), requires the use of session cookies.
Session cookies expire and are deleted after 30 minutes of no activity on Trade
Me.
<br>
<br>
Trade Me also uses persistent cookies to personalise the user experience, to
help protect our members and to provide us with research information (such as
how often members visit Trade Me each month). Persistent cookies allow us to
track users on Trade Me and helps us identify users abusing the Trade Me
service.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Other information we collect</b><br>
We use additional information to do internal research on our users'
demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and
our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from
(whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether
this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP
address.
<br>
<br>
Users who login have their IP addresses recorded. This information can be used
to track users who abuse the Trade Me system and will be only be provided to
legal authorities in cases of suspected fraud. IP addresses can be used, in
conjunction with an Internet Service Provider, to find the dial-in account of a
user and, ultimately, further information to identify a user. This information
is stored securely and will not be provided to other members or non-authorised
parties.
<br>
<br>
If you choose to post messages in our message areas or leave feedback for other
users, we will collect that information you provide to us.
<br>
<br>
If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other
users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings
on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Membership Removal</b><br>
If you wish to have your registration removed from our directory for any
reason, simply send us an email requesting to be removed.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Advertising and Third Party Links</b><br>
Some Trade Me advertisers may request information directly from users, or link
to sites that do so. Trade Me has no control over its advertisers' privacy
policies, and encourages users to review such policies prior to submitting any
personal information to them.
<br>
<br>
Trade Me contains non-advertising links to a variety of third party sites to
enhance the member experience. Trade Me has no control of either the content or
privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links be considered an
endorsement of these sites except where otherwise noted.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Nielsen//NetRatings - NZ internet statistics</b><br>
Trade Me, like most large New Zealand websites, uses the Nielsen//NetRatings
counting system to collect information such as the number of visitors per day
or the number of pages requested per day. To do this, Trade Me has a small
piece of code on each page which counts these statistics. This enables us to
see where we are in the 'top 10' list of New Zealand websites.

<br>
<b>Updates to our information practices</b><br>
From time to time, we make changes to our information practices or alter the
functionality of our Web site. We always update this statement accordingly, so
we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on
privacy practices at Trade Me.
