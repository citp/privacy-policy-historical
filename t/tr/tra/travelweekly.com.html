Alternatively, the law provides that if the    company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in  choice for use of your personal information by   third parties for  marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information  on how to exercise your   disclosure choice options.&nbsp;Because this  website is intended for use on a business-to-business basis, this    provision of California law will not apply, in most cases, to the  information collected.</font></p>
