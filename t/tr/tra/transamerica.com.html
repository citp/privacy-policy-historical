		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

			
			
            <p>Information Only - No Response Necessary</p>

			<p>Protecting your privacy is very important to us.  We want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it.  We collect and use nonpublic personal information in order to provide our customers with a broad range of financial products and services.  We treat your information with the utmost respect and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

			<h3>What Information We Collect and From Whom We Collect It</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms;</li>
				<li>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and</li>
				<li>Information we receive from non-affiliated third parties, including consumer reporting agencies and insurance support organizations.</li>
			</ul> 

			<p>Nonpublic personal information is nonpublic information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you.  In some states, personal information may also include your name, address and medical record information but not privileged information.  This information may be collected in person, by mail, fax, or by other electronic means as permitted by law or as expressly authorized by you.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Persons or companies that perform services on our behalf.</li>

			</ul> 

			<p>Nonpublic personal information about you that we obtain from a report prepared by an insurance support organization may be retained by that organization and disclosed to other persons.</p>

			<h3>Your Right to Verify Accuracy of Information We Collect</h3>

			<p>Keeping your information accurate and up to date is very important to us.  In some states, you may have the right to write to us in order to request that you have reasonable access to your nonpublic personal information (this includes a record of any subsequent disclosures of medical record information).  You may not access information relating to or in anticipation of a claim or a criminal or civil proceeding.  If you believe the information we collected about you is inaccurate, you may request that we amend, correct or delete it.  We will notify you of our decision, give you our reasons and the opportunity to file a concise statement of dispute with us if you do not agree.  Your statement will be made a part of our file and sent to persons or organizations that received your information in the past and in the future as required by law.</p>

			<h3>Our Security Procedures</h3>

			<p>We restrict access to the nonpublic personal information and only allow disclosures to persons and companies as permitted or required by law to assist in providing products or services to you.  We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal information.
