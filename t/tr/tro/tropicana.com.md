Important Note Regarding U.S. Law

  
By using our web sites, you signify that you agree with the terms of our current Privacy Policy as posted on our sites as well as the terms of our Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with any term in this Policy or our Terms and Conditions, please do not use this site or provide any Personal Information to us. 

  
As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information that is linked to your identity such as your name, street address, telephone number, screen name, age and/or email address. For information pertaining to Personal Information collected from children, click here. The site you entered may collect some or all of these types of Personal Information through a sweepstakes, contest, game, survey, questionnaire or promotion, or a registration form. Some of our web sites may require registration in order for you to participate in sweepstakes, games or other activities. Tropicana will not collect any Personal Information from your visits to our sites unless you provide your Personal Information to us voluntarily, and we will not require you to provide more information than is necessary to participate in our web sites' activities. We also do not collect financial or other sensitive data information about our users. 

When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information as described in this Policy. 

The web site you entered may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party (e.g., the site might allow you to send an email or message to a friend, in which case we will need that person's name and email address). Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to deliver the email message) and we will not contact the third party again by email unless and until the third party contacts us. 

  
When you supply Personal Information at a Tropicana web site, we will use it for the purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to fulfill the delivery of a sweepstakes prize or product order) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may also use it to contact you regarding Tropicana's products or promotions as well as other products and services, which may be requested by or otherwise of interest to you (including those we may offer jointly with other companies). At any time, however, you may opt out of such future contact by unsubscribing from our database. We also use Personal Information to keep track of a user's activities on our sites, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze web site usage, to improve our web site features, design and content and to refine our marketing strategies. 

We may also enhance your Personal Information by linking it to data obtained from third parties, such as non-personally identifiable information (e.g., demographic and geographic characteristics) as well as other publicly available data such as census information. Such enhanced information allows us to provide our users with a more customized experience. 

Tropicana's primary goal in collecting and using Personal Information is to give you a meaningful and customized experience while you are using our web sites as well as to promote our products in a cost effective and efficient manner. 

  
You may have heard of "cookies," which are small files or pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive when you visit a web site. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most web sites. Tropicana may use cookies to collect other information during your visit to our web sites, such as the particular site areas you visit and the activities in which you participate at our web sites. Tropicana does not automatically collect any Personal Information, but we may combine non-personal information collected automatically (through cookies) with voluntarily submitted Personal Information. Such link may occur only if you provide Tropicana with Personal Information on our sites. This practice allows Tropicana to keep track of items such as sweepstakes participation, email and advertising interaction levels, survey responses, online coupon redemption and other web activity in order to better tailor our web sites and our products to your interests and needs. Cookies may also be used to help speed up your future activities at our web sites -- the computer can remember that you have already provided Personal Information to us and not request that you provide any a second time. 

Anonymous information about your computer, such as your IP address (a number assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Internet), the type of Internet browser you are using, and the type of computer operating system you are using may also be collected by us using cookies. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from this web site, our servers log your IP address. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. Refusal of cookies at the site you entered may result in an inability to visit certain areas of the web sites or to receive personalized information when you visit the web sites. 

  
In the course of doing business, we employ other companies to perform a variety of functions on our behalf. For example, at times we may retain third parties to analyze, update and correct data we collect on our web sites, including Personal Information, to help us improve our products, our database and our web sites. In addition, we may share Personal Information with agents, suppliers, fulfillment houses and other third parties to allow delivery of prizes, information, products or services. These suppliers and other third parties may have access to your Personal Information if it is needed to perform their functions for Tropicana, but they are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any way other than the intended use. 

We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. For example, we may tell a business partner the number of men and the number of women that entered a contest, but we do not disclose Personal Information about such contestants in violation of this Privacy Policy. 

Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, transfer or disclose your Personal Information without your prior consent. 

We may release your Personal Information if required to do so by law, or by search warrant, subpoena or court order, or to a third party to which ownership of Tropicana is transferred via an acquisition, merger, sale of assets or otherwise. 

  
You are ultimately in control of the Personal Information that we collect and use. We want to keep your data complete, up to date and accurate. Tropicana provides its users with the following options to manage their Personal Information that is in reasonably retrievable form in our database: 

  * Send us an email: Go to the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20060618164857id_/http%3A//tropicana.com/TRP_PrivacyPolicy/index.asp?ID=113) page of the web site and send us an email. Be sure to include your name, username and clear instructions regarding any change to your Personal Information or if you would like us to unsubscribe you from our database.

In the event that a user unsubscribes from our database, we will retain a record of the Personal Information and the unsubscribe action for our internal records as evidence of the action and our compliance with this Privacy Policy. 

  
We take commercially reasonable precautions to keep your Personal Information secure. All access to the information we collect is subject to physical, electronic and managerial restrictions to prevent unauthorized access, modification or misuse. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.

The Quaker Oats Company intends to comply with the CARU guidelines in order to protect your kids and their privacy.

Tropicana does not endorse and makes no guarantee or representation as to the sufficiency, accuracy or completeness of the content or privacy policy of any third-party web site to which you may be linked from this site.
