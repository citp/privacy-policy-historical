## Privacy Policy

Tropical Smoothie Café, LLC is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers and users of our websites. This page presents our internet privacy policy. 

####  1\. Types of Information We Collect and How It Is Used 

Tropical Smoothie Café only gathers personal information, such as first and last names, addresses, email addresses and mobile numbers when voluntarily submitted by you. For example, personal information may be collected from you in order to get your feedback on our website and our products or to enter you in one of our contests or sweepstakes. 

####  2\. Sharing of Personal Information 

Tropical Smoothie Café may share personal information within affiliated companies that we own or control, as well our franchisees. Any affiliated companies and franchisees must comply with our privacy policy. 

We may also share personal information with other companies engaged by us to perform a variety of functions, such as fulfilling orders, assisting with promotions, providing technical services for our websites, etc. These companies may have access to personal information if needed to perform such functions. However, these companies may only use such personal information for the purpose of performing that function and may not use it for any other purpose. 

Tropical Smoothie Café reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety. 

We do not sell, transfer or disclose personal information to any other company without your permission, except as described above. 

####  3\. Children’s Privacy Notice 

This Children’s Privacy Notice is designed to answer your questions regarding our practices with respect to personal information we collect through our websites from children under the age of 13. 

What Personal Information Does Tropical Smoothie Cafe Collect? We may offer features on our websites, like games, which do not require a child to provide any personal information. On occasion, however, we may collect personal information, such as an email address, from children as part of an activity. 

For example: 

We may collect a child’s email address to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest or sweepstakes. In that event, we will notify the child using the email address the child supplies. We will not keep the address or use it for any other purpose. 

We may collect a child’s email address in order to respond to a request from the child on a one-time basis. In this case we promptly delete the email address from our system once we have responded, and we do not use the address for any other purpose. 

We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of 13, such as a postal address or telephone number, without the consent of a parent or guardian. If parent or guardian consent is required we will collect the email address of the parent or guardian so we can provide notice of our information practices and/or seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent. Tropical Smoothie Cafe will not condition a child’s participation in any online activity on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. 

How Does Tropical Smoothie Cafe Use the Personal Information It Collects? We use email addresses submitted by a child in order to respond to the child’s request or to notify the child if he or she has won or lost a contest or sweepstakes they entered. We use the email address of a parent or guardian, in order to provide the parent notice of our information practices or to seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent. 

How Does Tropical Smoothie Cafe Share Personal Information? We may share a child’s personal information with third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the security or integrity of our sites, take precautions against liability, or respond to judicial process or requests from other governmental authorities; or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. 

We also may share personal information collected from children with vendors that perform services for Tropical Smoothie Cafe. These services may include hosting our Website, providing technical services to Tropical Smoothie Cafe, fulfilling requests or administering sweepstakes. Such vendors are obligated to protect the confidentiality of the personal information we share with them. 

Requests from Parents Regarding Our Children’s Privacy Practices: Parents may review personal information we have collected from their child that has not been deleted, and can request that the personal information be deleted from our records if it has not been already. Parents also may refuse to permit further collection or use of their child’s personal information, when the parent has previously provided consent. To do so, please contact us at the address, telephone number or email address provided below with your request.
