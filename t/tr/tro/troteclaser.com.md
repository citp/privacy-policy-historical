### 1\. General information

Dealing sensitively with customer data is of greatest importance for Trotec Laser GmbH (“Trotec”, “we”, “us”). Thus, personal data is collected, stored and used in accordance with the data protection regulations, particularly the Austrian Data Protection Act in its current version ("DSG") and the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") for fulfilling contractual obligations. Any use over and above this, which is not justified on the basis of overriding legitimate interests in accordance with the applicable Data Protection Act, is permissible only after your consent following prior informatoin. You can revoke your consent at any time (e.g. via an e-mail to [trotec@troteclaser.com](mailto:trotec@troteclaser.com) ). This does, however, not affect the right to data processing for the performance of a contract. More details about the information that we collect, process and use when you visit and use our website [www.troteclaser.com](http://www.troteclaser.com/) ("website") have been provided below.

### 10\. Processing in the United States

In order to continue to be fully informed, under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR I furthermore permit Trotec to use my data in the context of the marketing interests described below: 

**I agree that my personal data voluntarily provided may be processed by Trotec for purposes of  **
