Visitors purchasing products or services will be required to provide additional Personal Information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date and shipping and billing addresses. With the exception of certain technical information later described, we do not collect any Personal Information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily (e.g. through interaction or registration with the Sites).

If you decide to provide us your Personal Information, it will generally be for: (1) account or product registration, or registration for online game participation; (2) the purchase of goods or services through our online store (including the purchase of in-game digital items (“ **Virtual Items** ”)); (3) message boards or forums; (4) newsletters; (5) e-cards or Send to a Friend promotions; (6) sweepstakes or contest registrations or surveys; (7) customer service or technical support; (8) consumer complaint(s); and (9) social media interaction.

### B. ACCOUNT OR PRODUCT REGISTRATION AND ONLINE GAME PARTICIPATION

Some areas of the Site may allow you to visit as a guest and remain anonymous, but you may not be able to access all the content and features of those areas without registering an account with us (e.g. in order to play our Games or purchase Game-related Virtual Items). Additional information, such as your real name and billing information, will be required (an “ **Account** ”) in order to access advanced features. Important information regarding Account registration procedures and the security of your Account is set out in our [Terms of Use and Contractual Agreement (https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/)](https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/).

### C. ONLINE GAMES

When you play any of the Games offered and/or served by Trion, or use any of the communication features on the Site, your Internet Protocol address (the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider) (your “ **IP Address** ”) from which you access any of the above may be stored in our records. Trion may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, Site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

When any Game is updated or “ **patched** ,” our patch routine may check your computer to see that you have the most recent version of Game-specific files; when you communicate within any Game or any other communication feature within the Sites (e.g. live chat, instant message services and the like), even “ **privately** ” to another person, you do so with the understanding that those communications go through our servers. You expressly agree to waive any rights of confidentiality that you may have in and to your communications (if any) when using any of the Sites’ communication features, you agree you have no expectation of privacy in any of those communications; and, accordingly, where and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you expressly consent to monitoring of communications (including technical support and customer service communications) that you send and receive. When you log in to one of our Games, your system specifications (such as OS, RAM, video card, monitor, system configuration, crash data, diagnostic data, etc.) may be reviewed/recorded by us for the purposes of analyzing and optimizing your Game experience and in order to provide you with customer service.

### F. NEWSLETTERS AND SEND TO A FRIEND PROMOTIONS

Typically you need to have an Account in order to receive emails from us, provided that you may receive email communications from us on a one-time basis if you have contacted us directly with regard to a specific request or for email newsletters. You can opt-out of receiving future marketing emails from us by following the directions contained in the email to “unsubscribe.”

Notwithstanding your email preferences, from time to time, Trion may send a transactional or relationship message which provides information concerning a transaction you have agreed to, your membership, subscription or account and/or warranty or safety information.

Also, except in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited by law to do so, the Site or service offerings available thereon may allow you to submit information about other people. For example, we may offer “Send to a Friend” promotions, like electronic postcards available on the Site or through our newsletters. In these situations, you may provide the email address and, sometimes, the name of a friend. After the “Send to a Friend” transaction is completed, that information is deleted. We will not retain the recipient’s email address for longer than necessary to complete the transmission. In our communication to your friend in this circumstance, he or she will only receive further information from us if he or she has affirmatively opted-in to receive future emails from us.

This information may be collected by Trion or by third parties such as co-sponsors or vendors for the promotion. Potential winners may be required to provide additional Personal Information for the purpose of verifying eligibility and awarding prizes, and for tax purposes.

Please note that, as mentioned elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and/or in our [Terms of Use and Contractual Agreement (https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/)](https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/) and/or on the Sites itself, Trion may collect from you Personal Information relating to certain third parties, such as your parents, other family members, friends, etc. (“Indirect Personal Information”).

### WHAT NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU

General, aggregated, demographic, and non-Personal Information may be collected by Trion. This type of anonymous, aggregated profiling and session data includes information that you have provided to us through surveys, polls, etc., and is combined with your IP address.

As part of the registration process for some services, you will be asked to provide information that does not personally identify you. For example, you will be asked to provide information concerning your date of birth, country, entertainment preferences, purchasing habits, and the like. This information is generally optional, but where provided it will be included in your Account profile and you hereby consent to this information being tied to your Personal Information. Trion requests this information to understand you better and to also bring to your attention new services, programs, or offers that may be of interest to you. Where Trion automatically collects non-Personal Information as stated above, and it is possible to link this information to your Personal Information, you hereby consent to Trion linking relevant non-Personal information to your Personal Information.

In many cases, Trion will automatically collect certain non-Personal Information about your use of the Sites. Trion might collect, among other things, information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet Service Provider, your “click path” through the Sites, and the website or advertisement that was linked to or from the Site when you visited. To do this, Trion may use cookies and other technology (see next section). In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to Trion. Trion may use this information to generate statistics about our user community and may provide such information to advertisers and/or our affiliates. Trion may also use such information for security, system integrity (e.g. the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.) or enforcement purposes. Please note that, your visits to the Sites, and information provided through these technologies, will be connected to your IP address and are therefore not anonymous.

### INFORMATION ON COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY

COOKIES

The Sites, and some services and advertisements displayed or made available thereon, may contain “ **cookies**.” Cookies are a feature of your web browser which allow websites to transfer bits of information to your computer for recordkeeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to “ **remember** ” things such as your password or that you have already registered an Account. This enables us to accelerate your future activities, saving the time that you would otherwise spend entering information such as your username or password.

Trion (itself or through a third party service) also employs a software technology called clear GIFs (also known as “ **web beacons** ”) that helps us better manage content on our Sites by informing us what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on Site pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These clear gifs are tied to unique identifiers such as your IP address. Technology and tools such as clear GIFs assist in the delivery of cookies.

Our third party tracking service uses cookies and clear gifs to track information about visitors to our Sites in the aggregate. They capture usage and volume statistics to help improve our Sites. We have no access to or control of these third-party tracking utilities. Upon request, Trion will provide a non-exhaustive list of these third party service providers. If you wish to opt out this third party data collection, you must opt out of Trion’s services.

We also use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear GIFs are tied to Personal Information.

Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). Certain cookies are required to allow or facilitate electronic communications or are necessary to allow the provision of online services at the request of the user. Personal Information, such as unique identifiers (i.e. IP address), collected through the use of these technologies will be collected, stored and processed according to this Privacy Policy.

Trion (itself or through a third party service) uses cookies, clear GIFs, frames, server log analysis and other technology to:

  * enable you to move around the Sites and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Sites;
  * collect information about how you use our Sites, estimate our audience size and usage patterns, and improve how our Sites work;
  * store information about your preferences, so as to allow us to customize your experience with the Sites and its subsites;
  * to speed up your searches;
  * recognize you when you return to our Sites;
  * retrieve information for promotional, marketing or security purposes; and
  * collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.



By using our Sites, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device and use clear GIFs.

Most Internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions or “Help” screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the Sites may not function properly.

CONSENT TO MONITOR

Please note that, when running, some Games may monitor your computer’s random access memory (“ **RAM** ”), media access control (“ **MAC** ”) address, configuration files and system files, etc., for unauthorized third party programs running concurrently with your Game which, in Trion ‘s sole determination: (i) enable or facilitate cheating of any type; (ii) allow users to modify or hack the applicable Game interface, environment, and/or experience in any way not expressly authorized by Trion; or (iii) intercept, “ **mine** ” or otherwise collect information from or through the applicable Game (an “ **Unauthorized Third Party Program** ”). In the event that a Game detects an Unauthorized Third Party Program, (a) the Game may communicate information back to Trion, including without limitation your Account username, details about the Unauthorized Third Party Program detected and the activities or functions performed thereby, and/or details about your computer, and/or (b) Trion may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies under the Terms of Use and Contractual Agreement (https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/) or the applicable Game EULA without prior notice to the user linked to such Unauthorized Third Party Program.

You acknowledge that any and all data that is stored and is resident on our servers, and any and all communications that you make within the Sites or any Games (including, but not limited to, messages solely directed at another player or group of players) traverse through our servers, may or may not be monitored by us or our agents (to the extent permitted by applicable law), you have no expectation of privacy in any such communications and expressly consent to such monitoring of communications you send and receive. You expressly agree to waive any rights of confidentiality that you may have in and to your communications (if any) when using any of the Sites’ communication features, you agree you have no expectation of privacy in any of those communications and, accordingly, and you expressly consent to such monitoring of communications (including technical support and customer service communications) that you send and receive.

### HOW WE USE AND SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU

### A. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU

Personal Information which we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to use it for some other purpose, as described in this Privacy Policy. For example, if you make an online purchase from us, unless you have given us permission to do otherwise, we will only collect and save the Personal Information you provided to us, including your billing and delivery information, in order to (1) complete the sale, (2) comply with tax and other applicable statutes, (3) maintain accurate business and financial records (in accordance with accepted standards), and (4) assist with customer service and returns.

We may use the Personal Information we collect from you to enable us to:

  * learn what you like and tailor your experience accordingly; 
  * improve the Sites and its subsites and our other products and services; 
  * provide services or products you request; 
  * allow you to participate in or use the Trion communication features;

  * allow you to benefit from any other services, as the case may be, such as sweepstakes, contests and promotions; 
  * manage your Account and respond to your potential orders, requests and online purchases; 
  * inform you of any changes made to the Sites and its subsites; and 
  * inform you of products, services, promotions and offers which you may find interesting.



If you do not want us to use your Personal Information in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, you can “ **opt-out** ” in the manner discussed under “ **Your Privacy Rights** ” set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Back to top

### B. INFORMATION WE PROVIDE TO THIRD PARTIES

Where and to the extent required by the applicable laws, you hereby expressly consent to your Personal Information being shared with or otherwise transferred by Trion to third parties.

When you have provided Personal Information to us for a particular purpose, we may disclose your information to other companies that we have engaged to assist us in fulfilling your request and who we subject to confidentiality requirements. This may include, but is not limited to, fulfillment houses, billing services, payment gateway services, transaction managers, credit verification servicesand other third party service providers. A very limited number of these third party payment gateway service providers may then further use the Personal Information to provide targeted marketing and advertising services. We may also disclose any of your Personal Information to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by applicable laws, or, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion, in order to protect the rights, property or safety of Trion, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

We will also provide your Personal Information to third party processors so that it can be administered and processed for the purposes notified to you in the Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use and Contractual Agreement (https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/) and we may also share details with third parties (such as auditors or legal advisors) in order to obtain professional advice. Any such processing will be governed by an agreement in the form required by applicable laws, preserving any and all of your statutory data protection rights.

Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not give any of your Personal Information to any third party without your express approval, and the only Personal Information we will request to share with third parties is your name, mailing address and email address. If you do not want us to share your Personal Information with third parties, you can “opt out” in the manner discussed under “Your Privacy Rights” set forth at the beginning of this Privacy Policy. If you do choose to opt out, in some instances, you must opt out of Trion’s services. We sometimes share general, demographic, or aggregated non-Personal Information with third parties about our user base, but that information does not include any Personal Information.

You will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of the Site, of any Personal Information contained in the Trion database for such Site, if Trion or one of its companies assigns all of its rights and obligations regarding the use of your Personal Information at the time of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale of all or substantially all of the Site’s assets to a subsequent owner or operator, or similar event.

### C. INFORMATION ABOUT LINKS AND THIRD PARTIES RELATED TO THE SITE

GENERAL

You have the right to access information held about you by Trion. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected online by Trion through the Sites, as maintained by Trion and affiliated companies that Trion may own or control.

From time to time, we may provide links to third party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third party websites, whether we provide a link to such sites or not, so we encourage you to review the policies of all such sites carefully, as your rights will be governed by those third party policies and not by Trion’s. Additionally, there may be unauthorized third party websites that may be providing links from their sites to our Sites without our knowledge or control.

We are not responsible for the content of any third party websites, expressly disclaim any statements or assertions made on such websites, and deny all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such other sites or advertisements contained therein.

INFORMATION ABOUT CO-PUBLISHED GAMES

Certain Games may be provided to you in conjunction with a third party developer and/or publisher. During the registration process for such Games, you may be notified that such third party wishes to access your Personal Information. In such a situation, you will be given an opportunity to consent to the sharing of that information before such information is disclosed to the applicable third party. However, if you do not provide consent then you may be unable to participate in the applicable co-published Game. As described in the registration process, a third party’s use of the shared Personal Information will be governed by its privacy policy and Trion’s use of such information shall, of course, be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES

Trion may employ the use of third party service providers in order to facilitate the usability and functionality of the Sites and/or services. These third party service providers may collect data about you through your use of Trion’s Sites and/or services. It is your responsibility to review the privacy policies and practices of these third party service providers, particularly those linked below. Your use of the Sites and/or services indicate your agreement to such collection of your data.

Trion may use third party software from companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). Each of these organizations offers a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads from its member companies.

### SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED

Trion has made an effort to ensure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form (i.e. free from any alteration). As such, access to all Personal Information is strictly controlled by limiting access to Personal Information to employees performing a legitimate business function. When payment information is transmitted, for example, Trion employs an industry standard security technology known as a secure-socket-layer (“SSL”) encryption. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the Site where you make a purchase, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of Personal Information.

While Trion takes reasonable precautions against possible breaches of the Site and customer databases, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Consequently, Trion cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, but we have in place reasonable technical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Information against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or against unauthorized disclosure or access to the Personal Information we collect online. We will notify users of a data breach involving unencrypted Personal Information by email and/or by posting a notice to the affected Site(s).

Trion urges you to take steps to keep your Personal Information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your Account information), logging out of your user Account and closing your web browser when you are finished using the Sites.
