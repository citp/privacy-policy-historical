Privacy Statement   
****

**We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy.**  The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our associated web sites. Healthy Traditions respects your privacy and does not give out or sell client information. We do use "cookies" in our ordering shopping cart system in order to determine if you are an existing customer.  We also use "cookies" in our Internet advertising to show you advertisements for our products that you may see displayed on other websites.

We only store your address and order history in our database when you place an order so that you can check the status of your orders. This information is not shared with any other company but is passed on to the credit card processing company if you choose to make payment by credit card when placing an order. No other information is collected or stored in our database.

We do NOT store your credit card, and you have to enter in your credit card number each time you order. Since we offer products and services, we may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart. Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We may collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to our customers. The customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Financial information that is collected, if any, is used to bill the user for products and services. As stated above, credit card information is NOT stored on our servers. The information enters a secure payment gateway to a third party financial institution that authorizes the charge on your card to purchase our products.

This site has not been notified of California Statute CA B&PC Section 22575(a) noncompliance. This site maintains a privacy policy in conformity with Section 22575(b).

This site complies with the EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002) and does not process the data referred to in paragraph 1 of the Directive except to the extent and for the duration necessary for services or marketing, if the subscriber or user to whom the data relates has given his/her consent. Insofar as information collected by Healthy Traditions may be covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), all such information is maintained as Confidential in strict conformity with HIPPA rules. In such case, the person to whom such information pertains may obtain copies upon request in conformity with the requirements of HIPPA.

Please see our Disclaimers, above.   
  
Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, this web site never collects or maintains information at our web site from those we actually know are under the age of 18, and no part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 18.

All web site promotions, contests, and sweepstakes are open only to persons over the age of 18. No information should be submitted to or posted on this web site by persons under 18 years of age, nor should any games, contests and/or sweepstakes be played by children under 18 years of age. This web site does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18 and does not sell such information.

If we discover that we have received any information from a child under 18 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe this web site to have any information from or about anyone under 18, please [contact us](https://healthytraditions.com/contact) immediately.   
  
Security Choices   
****

**This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control.**  We use secure server technology to ensure none of your private information is intercepted by outside parties. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure their browser is capable of using this technology. We are not responsible for the results of sabotage, changed regulations and laws or other causes beyond our control.

Healthy Traditions upholds the highest security standards possible on the Internet. We never store credit card numbers anywhere on our servers, and because of this, your order is charged at the time of purchase, not the time of delivery. Other companies which charge your card at the time of shipping are storing your credit card number on their server. Many of these businesses are hosting their websites on "shared servers" with many other businesses with public access to the same computer. Tropical Traditions subscribes to SafeSite, a fee-based merchant service that scans our servers DAILY to look for security holes, and we run our websites on dedicated servers that no one else has access to.
