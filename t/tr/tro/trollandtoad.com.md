**What information about customers do we store?**

However, to protect your privacy, we don’t show any of your account information until you have entered the password you selected when you set up your account. If you, as a user of the site, choose to not accept cookies, this will not prevent you from shopping on our site. However, you won't be able to use the shopping cart. After choosing the items you wish to purchase, you can then either e-mail the order to us, or call us on the phone, or fax us with the list of items you wish to order.

**Who has access to your information?**

On our site, only you or people you give your password to can access the information on our site. Our employees have access only to information needed to actually process an order for you, and they go through a rigorous screening process before becoming employed by our company. We do not sell our mailing list (or any information on it) to any other business. We may choose to mail you advertising or information on our products or the products or services of other companies, but we will never allow them access to your information or your name or address.

**How secure is the information on the Web site?**

All your private information is stored on the site using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you input. Only the information listed in the section below can be physically seen on our site, and only by yourself or someone else you have given your password to. NOTE: Your credit card is never listed on our site. Even when changing your credit card, only the last 5 digits are ever seen. All our credit card processing is handled by Authorize.net, a world international company authorized by all the major credit card companies to handle confirmation and charging of credit card numbers.

**What information can I access?**

You can access your account information, your wish list, the contents of your current shopping cart, and your willingness to be on our private e-mail mailing list.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. 

To correct or update your information go to "[My Account](https://www.trollandtoad.com/myaccount/index.php)" and choose "[Update My Account Information](https://www.trollandtoad.com/myaccount/user.php)." 

If you wish to remove yourself as a user, you must e-mail customer support with e-mail address, and give us the last 5 digits of your credit card number, and ask to be deleted.  We will delete your registration within 2 business days.

**Choice/Opt-out**

Our users are give the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information when you register. For example, under "[Update My Account Information](https://www.trollandtoad.com/myaccount/user.php)" under the "[My Account](https://www.trollandtoad.com/myaccount/index.php)" tab, you can choose at any time Yes or No to be on our e-mail mailing list.

Troll and Toad welcomes users of all ages to use our website. However, if you are under the age of 13, you may not register on our website without permission from your parents, as that is against FTC (Federal Trade Commission) rules about collection of personal information from children. 

If you then are under 13, and want to register on our site, we suggest that instead you have your parents register to use the site, and ask them permission to use their account.
