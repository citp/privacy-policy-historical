We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.

We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities. 

As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of TrollAndToad and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible.

TrollAndToad sites may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, please be aware that this information is being made publicly available online and the user does so at his or her own risk. For certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their full first and last name with the option to also display the name of their primary geographic location and affiliation. If your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at privacy@trollandtoad.com.

**What About Children?**

 _Children Under 13_ Once a child states that his/her age is under 13, we do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as name, address, or email address. _Note to Parents_ We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information about young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when online. Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns. 

**What Are Cookies and Clear Gifs And How Are They Used?**

Cookies are a feature of your web browser that allows websites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration. In addition, TrollAndToad may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional, marketing, or security purposes. 

TrollAndToad and our third-party tracking service also employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These clear gifs are not tied to personally identifiable information. 

Our third-party tracking service uses cookies and clear gifs to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate. They capture usage and volume statistics to help improve our website. We have no access or control of these third-party tracking utilities. 

We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information. 

**What Are Internet Protocol Addresses?**

An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). TrollAndToad may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abuses. 

**What Do I Do If I Want To Correct Or Delete My Personal Information?**

If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact TrollAndToad.Com Privacy Policy, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at 250 American Greeting Card Rd. Corbin KY 40701. You can also contact us by emailing us at privacy@trollandtoad.com. We will respond to any request for access within 30 days. 

In some cases, we may not be able to delete your personal information and will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

Please note that the deletion of your data will lead to the termination of your account and applicable services. 

**How Secure Is My Personal Information?**

TrollAndToad has taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information. We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services. 

**What If I Have A Question Or Complaint?**

If you have any questions or wish to file a complaint, please feel free to email us at privacy@trollandtoad.com or send a letter addressed to TrollAndToad.Com, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, at 250 American Greeting Card Rd. Corbin, KY 40701.
