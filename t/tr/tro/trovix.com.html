<p>Trovix respects your privacy and provides this notice to explain our approach to protecting your privacy. This Policy applies to the Trovix Service ('Service'), as provided on our website at trovix.com. If you object to any or all of this Privacy Policy, you should not provide your information.</p>
<p>If you choose to purchase advertising on the site, or use other advanced features, you will be advised at that time of how any additional information you provide will be handled.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of <strong>November 1, 2007</strong>.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Information we collect and how we use it</strong></p>
<p>As you use the Service, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
<ul class="privacyul">
<li>• <strong>Information provided by you –</strong> You may choose to give us personal information through forms on the web page or document uploads. If you choose to purchase products or services through our site, you may give us credit card information or other payment and account information, which will be stored in encrypted form on secure servers.</li>
<li>• <strong>Cookies – </strong>Cookies are small text files which are used to uniquely identify your browser. Like most websites, Trovix uses cookies to understand your usage of our site and improve the quality of our service. The cookies we use are encrypted and do not contain any information about you. You may disable cookies in your browser, but our Service may not function properly if you do this.</li>
<li>• <strong>Browsing history – </strong>When you use the Service, some of your browsing history will automatically be identified in our servers, such as the information about the browser and other equipment you use to access the service, the IP address used for the current session, and links you click on while visiting our site. Additionally, referring sites may pass us information about how you got to our site. We may also store the history of changes to your profile, of purchases from Trovix, and of information exchanges through the Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to help us provide, personalize and improve our Service. We may also use aggregated or anonymized information to describe our user base in marketing and sales materials, provided this information cannot be used to identify you.   We may also use this information to select which advertisements to display to you. In this manner it may be accessed by our employees or contractors we work with.</p>
<p>We will use your information and documents as described above. If we need to use it in any other way, we will contact you, and you may then give or withhold your consent.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure to third parties</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to post or publish information or send information to third parties through the Service, we will do so on your behalf. Trovix does not otherwise rent or sell any of your information to third parties except when we have your specific permission. These third parties may have a different privacy policy than Trovix, so we encourage you to review their privacy policies prior to sharing your information if you have concerns.</p>
<p>As a rule, we will not give away information or documents or browsing history that personally identify you, except when we have your permission. However, in some situations we may need to disclose information to third parties:</p>
<ol class="privacyol">
<li>1. If required by law, or to comply with subpoenas or court orders, or to defend against legal claims, or to exercise or establish our legal rights;</li>
<li>2. If we believe it is necessary to protect our users against illegal activities or suspected fraud, or to prevent such activities, in situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of a person, or in cases involving violations of Trovix’s <a href="terms.jsp">Terms of Use</a>;</li>
<li>3. As stated on the Trovix site when the information was collected.</li>
<li>4. Trovix may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.  Trovix will notify you before transferring your information to a new entity as part of a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of some or all of its assets if the new entity's processing of your information will materially differ from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Aggregate information</strong></p>
<p>We may aggregate anonymous user data including browsing history in order to understand usage patterns of the Service and improve our Service. We may also use this aggregated data in publicly describing our Service or may share it with third parties. Such aggregated data does not contain any information that can be used to identify individual users.</p>
<p><strong>Trovix communications with you</strong></p>
<p>We will communicate with our users through email and our website. We may contact you with news and updates, opportunities, and other information relevant to the Service and your usage of it. We may also send you some promotional information unless you opted out of receiving such emails.</p>
<p>You may opt out of receiving communications from us at any time. All of our emails will have an unsubscribe link, and registered users can also opt out of communications while on the site. We reserve the right to send you certain administrative messages regarding the use of your account.</p>
<p><strong>Third party sites</strong></p>
<p>Trovix may include links to other sites. These sites have their own privacy policies which users are encouraged to read. Trovix is not responsible for the privacy policies of these sites nor the use of information submitted on those sites.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing and modifying your information</strong></p>
<p>Users can view, correct, update, or delete any personal information submitted to the Service at any time by logging in to their accounts. Any deleted information becomes immediately unavailable for use within the Trovix website; however, deleted information may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after deletion. We also have no control over any previous disclosures to third parties that you had authorized us to make.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Trovix knows that information and documents you submit to the Service may be confidential in nature. Trovix uses industry standard security measures to safeguard your information and documents against loss, misuse, and alteration while under Trovix’s control.</p>
<p>The Trovix site uses security systems including firewalls and is hosted in a secure location with restricted access to the physical computers that run the Trovix site.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of changes</strong></p>
<p>Trovix may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on our website located at <a href="privacy.jsp">trovix.com</a>. We may send you an email so that you are aware of updates of the policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this site will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>
