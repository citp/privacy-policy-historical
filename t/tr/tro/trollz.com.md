In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“ **Usage Information** ”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “ **Device** ”) whenever you visit or interact with our Service. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service or the Usage Information can otherwise be associated with you, we will treat it as Personal Information. Where required by applicable law ( _e.g._ , in Europe), we will treat Usage Information as Personal Information in any event.

This Usage Information may include:

  * your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“ **Device Identifier** ”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
  * your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
  * the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;
  * your Device location;
  * your Device characteristics; and
  * certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.



We will use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“ **Tracking Technologies** ”). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following:

 ** _Cookies_**. A cookie is a text file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service. A Flash cookie (or Locally Shared Object) is a text file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. “Regular” cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Please refer to the help and support area on your browser for instructions on how to block or delete cookies. Note, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe’s website [www.adobe.com](http://www.adobe.com/). For information on managing “regular” cookies, please go to [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/), or visit [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (if you are resident in the E.U.), or visit [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) (if you are resident in the U.S.), or visit <http://youradchoices.ca/understanding-online-advertising#cookies> (if you are resident of Canada), which has further information about behavioural advertising and online privacy. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Service may not function properly, and that when you visit our Service your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

 ** _Web Beacons_**. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs”, “clear GIFs” or “pixels”) may be included in our Service’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.

 ** _Embedded Scripts_**. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.

 ** _Browser/Device Fingerprinting_**. Collection and analysis of information from your Device, including your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.

 ** _ETag, or entity tag_**. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.

 ** _Recognition Technologies_**. Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices ( _e.g._ , that a user of multiple devices is the same user).

We use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:

 ** _Strictly Necessary_**. These cookies or other Tracking Technologies are essential in order to help you use and access our Service.

 **5\. Ads and Information About You**

We and third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges may serve advertisements across the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your activities across the Internet and mobile media (“ **Behavioral Ads** ”). Behavioral Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which we believe you might be interested. If you object to receiving Behavioral Ads from us on third party sites, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below. Our third party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information via a Device Identifier. These third party technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements; and (c) understand the usefulness of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.

Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.

Some third parties may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available **[here](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/third-parties/)**

For further information on Behavioral Ads and what is known as “online behavioral advertising”, U.S. residents may wish to visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“ **NAI** ”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.

Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.

 **9\. What Should Parents Know About Children?**

We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy in the interactive world. We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may collect from children under the age of thirteen (13) (“ **Child** ” or “ **Children** ”) and do not knowingly collect personal information from Children on our Services that require parental notice and consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“ **COPPA** ”) without obtaining such parental consent.

Some of the features on our Service are “age-gated” so that they are not available for use by Children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from Children in connection with those features. When we intend to collect personal information from Children, we take additional steps to protect Children’s privacy, including:

  * Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to Children, including the types of personal information we may collect from Children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information.
  * In accordance with applicable law, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their Children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their Children.
  * Limiting our collection of personal information from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.
  * If the Service is either directed to Children or we have actual knowledge that a user is a Child, the Child may be asked to provide his or her parent’s or guardian’s email address.
  * Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their Children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.



In the event that we become aware that we have collected personal information from any Child without first having obtained parental consent, we will dispose of that information in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your Child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personal information without COPPA-required consent, please contact us at [privacy@dhxmedia.com](mailto:privacy@dhxmedia.com).
