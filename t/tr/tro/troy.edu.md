Personal information provided by visitors, such as email addresses or information submitted via online forms, is used by the University to assist individual visitors as necessary.

This information and information about Internet IP addresses, as well as date and time web pages are visited, are stored in various security and traffic logs. Our service provider reviews these logs, using statistical analysis, in an effort to track and predict traffic patterns and estimate resource needs. Unless we are tracking down a technical problem or we suspect either fraudulent behavior or illegal conduct, we do not trace specific user sessions. Because Troy University is a public institution, some information collected from its website may be subject to the Alabama Open Records Act, or in some instances, the University may be compelled by law to release information gathered from its web servers. Some web servers at Troy University may adopt different privacy statements as their specific needs require that may differ from this statement.

Troy University monitors anonymous website visitor traffic through the use of cookies provided by third-party services, including Google Analytics, to review website performance and to identify enhancements that may benefit visitors based on current navigation patterns and search trends. The university may contract with third-party vendors to show our advertisements on non-TROY websites and other digital delivery mechanisms. No personally-identifiable information is stored and collected by the university for these purposes. 

Troy University also complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which prohibits the release of educational records without student permission.
