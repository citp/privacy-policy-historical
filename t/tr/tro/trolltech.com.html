	<p>
	    Trolltech respects your privacy and is committed to protect the
	    personal information that you share with us. Generally, you can
	    browse through our website without giving us any information about
	    yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide
	    services that you request or when you choose to provide us with
	    your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and
	    use your personal information.
	</p>
	<h3>Information Collection</h3>
	<p>
	    Personal information means any information that may be used to
	    identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and
	    last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address,
	    other contact information, title, birth date, gender, occupation,
	    industry, personal interests, other information when needed to
	    provide a service you requested.
	</p>
	<p>
	    When you browse our website, you do so anonymously, unless you have
	    previously indicated that you wish Trolltech to remember your login
	    and password. We do not automatically collect personal information,
	    including your email address. We do log your IP address (the
	    Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part
	    of our website you visit and how long you spend there. We do not
	    link your IP address to any personal information unless you have
	    logged in to our website. Like many other commercial websites, the
	    Trolltech website may use a standard technology called a "cookie"
	    to collect information about how you use the site. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Trolltech collects personal information when you register with
	    Trolltech for a Trolltech account, when you use certain Trolltech
	    products or services, when you register to attend a seminar or
	    participate in an online survey, when you ask to be included in an
	    email or other mailing list, or when you submit your personal
	    information to Trolltech for any other reason. From time to time,
	    Trolltech receives personal information from business partners and
	    vendors. Trolltech only uses such information if it has been
	    collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices
	    consistent with this Policy and applicable laws.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Access to certain Trolltech web pages requires a login and a
	    password. The use of those web pages, and the information or
	    programs downloadable from those sites, may be governed by a
	    written agreement between your employer and Trolltech. Unless you
	    request deletion of your personal information as specified below,
	    your personal information may be retained by Trolltech to verify
	    compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to
	    track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other
	    applications available on those pages.
	</p>
	<h3>Cookies and Tracking Technology</h3>
	<p>
	    A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your
	    hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain
	    information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages
	    you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can
	    contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read
	    data on your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
	    Some parts of Trolltech's website use cookies to track user traffic
	    patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our
	    website information to our users and to see how effective our
	    navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.
	</p>
	<p>
	    If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website,
	    you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and
	    refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You
	    can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser,
	    although you may not be able to take full advantage of Trolltech's
	    website if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept
	    cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You do
	    not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate
	    through many parts of our website, except access to certain of
	    Trolltech's web pages may require a login and password.
	</p>
	<h3>How We Use Information Collected</h3>
	<p>
	    Trolltech uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill
	    your requests for certain products and services, to personalize
	    your experience on our website, to keep you up to date on the
	    latest product announcements, software updates, or other
	    information we think you'd like to hear about either from us or
	    from our business partners, and to better understand your needs and
	    provide you with better services. We may also use your information
	    to send you, direct marketing information or contact you for market
	    research.
	</p>
	<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
	<p>
	    Because Trolltech is a global company, your personal information
	    may be shared with other Trolltech offices around the world. All
	    such entities are governed by this Privacy Policy. Your personal
	    information is never shared outside Trolltech without your
	    permission, except under conditions explained below. Inside
	    Trolltech, data is stored in controlled servers with limited
	    access. Trolltech may send your personal information to other
	    companies or people under the following circumstances: when we have
	    your consent to share the information; we need to share your
	    information to provide the product or service you have requested;
	    we need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of
	    Trolltech to provide a product or service to you (we will only
	    provide those companies the information they need to deliver the
	    service, and they are prohibited from using that information for
	    any other purpose); or we want to keep you up to date on the latest
	    product announcements, software updates, or other information we
	    think you'd like to hear. We will also disclose your personal
	    information if required to do so by law, in order to comply with applicable legal and financial obligations, or in urgent
	    circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or our
	    websites.
	</p>
	<h3>Communications, Preferences and Opt-Out:</h3>
	<p>
	    Trolltech allows visitors to self-select communities, through the
	    registration process, as a way to provide initial customization to
	    the Trolltech site. 
	</p>
	<h3>Communications Choices</h3>
	<p>
	    Trolltech recognizes that users may not wish to be contacted about
	    new or related products. Trolltech.com allows you to opt-out of
	    e-mail marketing that may result from use of the site. These
	    choices may be made as part of the registration process or from
	    links in marketing mailings. You may also always return to the
	    registration profile to change your election relating to opt-out or
	    by sending an email to our automated link
	    
<script language="javascript">

document.write(link);
</script><a href="mailto:unsubscribe@trolltech.com">unsubscribe (at) trolltech.com</a>
. If you have any problems
	    in using these opt-out mechanisms, please send an e-mail to

document.write(link);
</script><a href="mailto:privacy@trolltech.com">privacy (at) trolltech.com</a>
, indicate opt-out in the
	    subject line and specify what problem you have encountered in the
	    body of the message. There are a few limited exceptions to the
	    opt-out, but notice is provided that the service includes certain
	    communications. These exceptions include: patch and product
	    security update related communications, defined communications
	    related to product download, specific communications that are part
	    of the reason for a specific trading or user community - such as
	    price/product related communications to the
	    members of our partner network.
	</p>
	<h3>Third Party Opt-in Lists</h3>
	<p>
	    On occasion, Trolltech may use a third party opt-in list. These are
	    lists maintained by third parties that have received permission
	    (opt-ins) from their users to receive e-mails from other companies,
	    such as Trolltech. 
	</p>
	<h3>Third Party Sites</h3>
	<p>
	    Trolltech's website contains links to other sites. Trolltech does
	    not share your personal information with those websites and is not
	    responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn
	    about the privacy policies of those websites.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Our website may contain links to websites operated by other
	    companies. Some of these third-party sites may be co-branded with a
	    Trolltech logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by
	    Trolltech. Although we choose our business partners carefully,
	    Trolltech is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites
	    operated by third parties that are linked to our site. Once you
	    have left our website, you should check the applicable privacy
	    policy of the third party website to determine how they will handle
	    any information they collect from you.
	</p>
	<h3>Children and Privacy</h3>
	<p>
	    Our websites do not target and are not intended to attract children
	    under the age of 13. Trolltech does not knowingly solicit personal
	    information from children under the age of 13 or send them requests
	    for personal information.
	</p>
	<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
	<p>
	    Trolltech will amend this policy from time to time. If we make any
	    substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we
	    will make that information available by posting a notice on this
	    site.
	</p>
	<h3>Questions or Suggestions</h3>
