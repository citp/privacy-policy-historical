**Information Collection and Use**

Tropo does collect a limited set of Personal Information directly from subscribers during the product registration process. The information we collect includes but is not limited to your name, email address, phone number to initially register and then subsequently address and credit card if you choose to buy the service. We use this information to provide services and customer support to you.

Tropo uses the limited subscriber Personal Information for its own internal marketing / product update email campaigns but offers the subscribers the opportunity, during the registration process to choose whether their personal information is to be used for this purpose. You can opt out by following the unsubscribe option included in each email.

**Information Sharing**

Tropo respects your privacy. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  Any business-related or personal information you provide to us — including your name and similar identifying information, such as your address, telephone number, and e-mail address — will not be released, sold, or rented to any entities or individuals outside of Tropo, except as necessary to provide services or products you specifically request.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as payment processing. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We may also disclose your personal information:

  * as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process
  * when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or in response to an official government request,
  * if Tropo is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information,
  * to any other third party with your prior consent to do so



**The Security of Your Information**

We will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in our possession from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We follow generally accepted industry standards, like secure socket layers (SSL) to protect the personal information submitted to us such as credit card number, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is, however, 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Access**

Tropo will provide reasonable assistance to its subscribers to provide access to Personal Information that it holds on their behalf. Tropo permits its subscribers, (once logged into their account) the ability to correct, amend, or delete any Personal Information which is inaccurate or incomplete via their profile page. We will respond to any requests to support@tropo.com for Personal Information or changes thereof within 30 days.

We will retain your account information as a historical business audit record only. We archive all unused accounts, delete the users’ ability to log into them or to recover and/or change password. We also disable your email so no further automated correspondence will be sent. From this day forward, we will only use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect against fraud and enforce our agreements

Tropo may keep a cached copy of the content you serve us as a part of your use of the service for an indeterminate amount of time, including media files and XML files. To assist in development, we may keep copies of HTTP requests and responses in your notification log, available to you and Tropo support personnel only. If your web server does not specify that we can cache your content, we will not keep a cached copy of any text or audio data transmitted through our service during calls, but we may still maintain copies in your notification log.
