<p><span class="bodybold">Just For Me Web Site (jfmvipclub.com) Privacy Terms</span> 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>While, in general, the Alberto Web sites are not directed at children, the jfmvipclub.com web site is designed for children. Your child’s privacy is important to us at jfmvipclub.com Alberto is committed to safeguarding children’s Personal Information collected online, and to helping parents and their children learn how to exercise control over Personal Information while exploring the Internet. The additional measures Alberto has taken to help children protect their privacy while online include not asking children to disclose more Personal Information than is necessary for them to participate in an activity. </p>
  <p>To help ensure a rewarding online experience for your child, Alberto provides you with this summary of our information practices on jfmvipclub.com. Specifically, this section of the Privacy Policy governs the collection and use of information solely at jfmvipclub.com.</p>
  <p>While Alberto generally collects only a limited amount of Personal Information, to enable children to participate in some of our online activities, Alberto may ask children to provide Alberto with their first name, hometown, and e-mail address. </p>
  <p>On some pages of jfmvipclub.com, such as where children can send electronic postcards to their friends, Alberto also may ask your child to provide Personal Information about other people. This is usually limited to a first name and e-mail address. Alberto also may ask for the name and e-mail address of the child’s parent. </p>
  <p>Similarly to the other Alberto Web sites (as described above), when children visit jfmvipclub.com, Alberto automatically collects certain non-Personal Information such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows 2000 or Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, and the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). As noted above, we sometimes use the non-Personal Information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. </p>
  <p>Alberto never shares children’s Personal Information with third parties without first obtaining appropriate parental consent. Alberto uses children’s information only for our internal purposes such as to enable children to express their opinions on various topics, to send electronic postcards to their friends, to subscribe to our online newsletter, and to enter one of our sweepstakes or contests. </p>
  <p>Alberto also uses the information that we collect to enable the children to communicate with each other, for example, to send an electronic greeting card to a friend, or to obtain your consent for participation in these activities, such as to allow us to notify you when your child has entered one of our contests or promotions. </p>
  <p>Also as discussed above, we also will disclose Personal Information if in our opinion such disclosure is required (i) by law, (ii) to protect and/or defend Alberto’s rights and/or (iii) to protect the personal safety of any individual. In addition, in the event that all or substantially all of Alberto's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Alberto may transfer Personal Information to the acquiring entity. We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request. </p>
  <p>Like the other Alberto Web sites, jfmvipclub.com contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different than those at this site. The privacy terms for jfmvipclub.com only applies to jfmvipclub.com and not to Web sites of any other company or organization linked to jfmvipclub.com or any other Alberto Web site. Linking to third party Web sites requires you to leave jfmvipclub.com. We do not control those third party Web sites or any of the content or services that they provide and we are not responsible for any damages or problems arising from those Web sites jfmvipclub.com encourages you to review all policies and terms of each Web site that you visit.</p>
  <p>As described above, we may use cookies that could enable us to relate any visitor’s use of jfmvipclub.com </p>
  <p>While currently, we do not store the e-mail addresses that we receive in connection with certain children’s activities on our site, we have, however, put in place appropriate safeguards to secure the very limited Personal Information that we receive from children for the very limited time it is in our possession. </p>
