**PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE TREMOR VIDEO SERVICES**

**What does Tremor Video do?**  
Tremor Video is an online video advertising technology company that offers advertisers, agencies, and other buyers (“advertisers”) opportunities to display their video ads on websites and applications across the Internet, including websites and applications made available through mobile devices, tablets, and connected TVs.

**How does Tremor Video deliver ads?**  
Video ads delivered by Tremor Video primarily appear immediately prior to or during a third-party publisher’s streaming video content.

Most of our advertisers’ video ads are delivered to third-party publishers by Tremor Video proprietary ad-serving technology.

**How are ads selected for delivery?**

Tremor Video’s customers are advertisers that engage us to display their video ads. Advertisers may specify where, when, and in what context they want their video ads to be displayed. These specifications are sometimes called targeting parameters.

Tremor Video uses its proprietary technology to select, target, and deliver ads according to the advertisers’ specifications. In order to optimize the delivery of a video ad, the technology collects and analyzes information provided by the web publisher, user’s browser, and advertiser, among other sources, which, in turn, is automatically recorded by the servers of Tremor Video. Examples of the types of information we may collect and store in the server logs are the following: browser type and language, operating system, Internet Protocol address (for example, to identify a user’s general location), page URL and referral URL, video player size, content (such as video title, description, category) , date and time of request, internet service provider (such as Verizon FiOS),  and advertising cookies.  When selecting, targeting and delivering ads, Tremor Video does not actively collect, and does not use or store personally identifiable information about a user.

The Tremor Video proprietary ad-serving technology may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies in order to select, target, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, including when determining what ads to present so that they may best relate to the possible preferences and interests of users based on information collected across multiple websites that they visit. We call this practice of collecting data about a user’s online activities in order to deliver advertising targeted to a user’s likely interests “interest-based advertising.”

A “cookie” is generally a small text file that is sent to a user’s computer. Cookies are commonly assigned by online services, such as websites or ad technologies, to recognize a computer that they have encountered before. A cookie is associated with a specific site domain, a specific computer, and a specific Internet browser program.

Our advertising cookies operate anonymously: we never use them to gather the user’s name, street address, e-mail address, or telephone number(s).

A “web beacon” is a small piece of code placed on web pages that can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit the web page, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing that page.

You can decline Tremor Video’s use of advertising cookies for interest-based advertising by clicking on the “Click to Opt Out” button at the top of this page.

Should you wish, you can set most modern browsers to reject cookies, and remove cookies that have already been placed. You can find out how to do so and otherwise manage cookies at [All About Cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).

You may also manage cookies from many companies at the [Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Opt Out Page for the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**How does Tremor Video deliver ads to mobile applications?**

In the case of advertisements selected, targeted, and delivered to mobile applications, the ad-serving technology may collect information provided by the user’s mobile device, including the hardware’s unique device ID. Tremor Video changes the unique device ID into an anonymous ID, which we use to deliver advertisements to your mobile device.  In addition, Tremor Video may collect certain unique mobile operating system IDs, such as Apple’s Identifier for Advertising ID (IDFA), or Google’s Android ID and its Android Advertising ID, to select, target, and deliver advertisements because users are provided the opportunity to reset these identifiers or opt out of interest-based advertisements through the applicable settings features of their mobile devices. These opportunities are subject to the offerings made available by the third-party operating system providers and subject to their privacy policies, and not any offerings by or the privacy policy of Tremor Video.  Other examples of information we may collect to select, target and deliver advertisements may be the type of the mobile device and the location of a mobile device if a user enables collection of precise location data through the available features on that mobile device.

**How do we use third-party service providers?**

Tremor Video and its advertisers may also use third-party ad service providers to help deliver advertisements. These ad service providers use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies to select, target, deliver, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, including when determining what ads to present so that they may best relate to the possible preferences and interests of users. Tremor Video may use data that ad service providers collect in the delivery of interest-based advertisements. This data is non-personally identifiable information and is used to deliver advertisements that may be more relevant to a user.

Tremor Video may share non-personally identifiable information about users gathered by means of cookies, web beacons, or other technologies, including anonymous identifiers used in connection with mobile applications, with certain ad service providers so that they can help Tremor Video deliver more relevant advertisements. The use of cookies, web beacons, or other technologies by other ad service providers is subject to their respective privacy policies, not the privacy policy of Tremor Video. You can find out more about ad service providers and the choices you have about these technologies by clicking on the links at the bottom of this privacy policy. Similarly, the publishers to which we deliver an ad are subject to their own privacy policies and not the privacy policy of Tremor Video.

You may view a list of third-party service providers, along with links to their websites, at the bottom of this page.

**Is information transferred to Tremor Video successors and affiliates?**

Tremor Video may transfer the information it collects in connection with its business to any successor-in-interest to Tremor Video (such as a company that acquires Tremor Video), or internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary or parent). Tremor Video may also disclose information if it determines that an applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or if Tremor Video determines that it needs to share such information to protect or enforce Tremor Video’s rights or the rights of another user.
