### Privacy Info

* * *

By accessing this site, certain information about the User, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, navigation through the Site, the software used and the time spent, along with other similar information, will be stored on Trend Hunter and Google Analytics servers. The information will be used internally only for web site traffic analysis. In some cases, this information is accessed via the use of "cookies", "web beacons" (image tags, GIF or web bugs), "embedded scripts" and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect Anonymous Information automatically as you browse Trend Hunter sites. 

Trend Hunter may enter into commercial agreements with advertisers, advertising networks, advertisement or user data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Advertisers") to, for example, serve advertisements on Trend Hunter sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on Trend Hunter sites ("Targeting Services"). In some cases, Tracking Technologies are employed in the use of these Targeting Services. 

Although these Third Party Advertisers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by Trend Hunter, the Third Party Advertisers may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on user devices if users choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in their browsers and/or they may otherwise have access to anonymous information about users. 

Personally Identifiable Information is not collected as part of the use of either Tracking Technologies or Targeting Services by Trend Hunter or Third Party Advertisers. If the User provides unique identifying information, such as name, address and other information on forms stored on this Site, such information will be used only for statistical purposes and will not be published for general access. Trend Hunter, however, assumes no responsibility for the security of this information. 

Should you wish to decline to allow the use Targeting Services by some Third Party Advertising Service Providers, the Network Advertising Initiative offers a web form by which web users can opt-out of user data collection activities by its member ad networks. This form can be found here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. 

Note, however, that Trend Hunter will not guarantee the availability, performance or functionality of the NAI Opt-Out Tool nor will Trend Hunter guarantee that it will limit its commercial partnerships to NAI member networks and service providers.
