# PRIVACY POLICY - TrendEbook

**How  Information are Collected and Use,**

**We collect the following types of information about you:**

**Information we may receive from third party or parties:**

We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the trendebook application, linking your account to trendebook Service, information etc., that third party may pass certain details about your use of its service to trendebook. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to use or share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service or information. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used that information to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join or subscribe to trendebook. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the trendebook Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.

**Inviting a friend to use trendebook:**

trendebook may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to invite third parties to the Service. If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our “Invite friends” feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device’s native contact list – but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to trendebook through the “Invite friends and shear” feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.

**Analytics information:**

We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.

**Cookies information:**

Full details can be found on our Cookie Policy. When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets trendebook help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time.

**Clear gifs/web beacons information:**

When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users.

A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by trendebook. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier feature may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
