Otherwise, the only information we hold about your friends and contacts is what you tell us through the site. So, again, think carefully about your posts!

*** Being Anonymous**

The fact that you can send messages without other people knowing who you are is part of what makes trendingtopmost.com unique and so much fun. It means that you can ask things that you might be too embarrassed or shy to say if anyone knew it was you. People are often bolder and more honest when they are anonymous, whether they’re asking a question anonymously, or answering a question where they don’t know who’s asked it.

The thing is though, that it also means that when you receive questions or comments, you may not know who they come from either!

Some people don’t like receiving things from people if they don’t know who they are. So every member can choose not to receive questions from anonymous users on the ‘Settings’ page.

We all know that some people might abuse the option to be anonymous by being mean or by saying horrible things because they know you don’t know who they are, but we will take steps to stop them from spoiling it for everyone else.

We may assist the Police or other law enforcement agencies with their requests to the extent required by law otherwise, will not tell anyone who you are if you want to remain anonymous.

Occasionally, a member may ask us if we can tell them the IP address of someone who sent them an anonymous message. Unfortunately, we are not able to give out that information.
