  4. To be free from verbal, emotional, physical abuse, and/or inappropriate sexual behavior.

  9. To be free to attend religious services or activities of his or her choice and to have visits from a spiritual advisor-- provided that these services or activities do not conflict with facility program requirements. Participation in religious services will be voluntary only.

Any complaints regarding violation of client rights should be directed to that pertinent state department for alcohol and drug treatment licensure. See [State Substance Abuse Agencies](http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/ufds/abusedirectors) for further information.  
NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY  
Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center affiliated programs do not discriminate in the provision of services on the basis of ethnic group identification, religion, age, sex, color or disability, pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Section 2000d, Title 42, United States Code), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 794, Title 29, United States Code); the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Section 12132, Title 42, United States Code); and per relevant State regulations wherein a Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center operates.  
ACCESSIBILITY POLICY  
Each Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment program maintains an ongoing policy and plan of accessibility, which conforms to federal and state requirements. It is Treatment-Centers.net's goal to have all of its services accessible to those individuals meeting the admission criteria. Each referral from Treatment-Centers.net will strive to provide certain program accessibility plans in attempts to cover the following potential barriers: 

  * Attitudinal
  * Architectural
  * Environmental
  * Financial
  * Employment
  * Communication
  * Transportation
  * Any other barriers, as these become identified.

Reasonable accommodations are provided, as needed, to enable qualified individuals to access a program’s operations and services. For more information, contact the particular facility’s intake department.  
BILLING & PAYMENT POLICY  
The client/patient and/or financial guarantor obligates himself/herself to pay the Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program Facility in accordance with the agreed rates and terms, notwithstanding the assignment of health coverage (call the intake department regarding treatment rates, expected deductibles and co-pays). Pharmacy/prescriptions may also need separate insurance coverage and/or payment arrangements.  
INSURANCE RESPONSIBILITY  
The client/patient must understand that it is the sole responsibility of the subscriber/guarantor to know what his/her insurance benefits are, and if the policy is in effect. The program's business office will make every effort to verify the insurance and to obtain the benefits from the insurance company. No employee or anyone affiliated with Treatment-Centers.net Drug and Alcohol Treatment Program will, or can be held responsible for knowing what a client's insurance will or will not cover. This includes benefits that may have been quoted by the insurance company. 

The business office will bill your insurance as a courtesy to you and make every effort to obtain payment. However, all or any portion of the bill that is not paid by the insurance carrier is the sole responsibility of the client and/or the guarantor. Benefits that are quoted by the insurance company may only reflect coverage charges and not 100% of the billed charges. Benefit quotations are subject to the member's eligibility at the time benefits were requested and any quotations are not a guarantee of benefit coverage or of member eligibility until actual insurance payment for services is received. All anticipated uninsured/non-covered charges and projected co-payments are expected to be paid upon admission. No interest will accrue to current accounts. Any and all unpaid portions of an account may be referred to a collection agency at thirty (30) days past due. If referred to collections, all interest and legal fees will be the responsibility of the debtor/guarantor.

NOTICE - CONFIDENTIALITY OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE PATIENT RECORDS  
The confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records maintained by this program is protected by federal law and regulations (per 42 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 2). Generally, the program may not say to a person outside the program that a patient attends the program, or disclose any information identifying a patient as an alcohol or drug abuser unless: 

  1. The patient consents in writing.
  2. The disclosure is allowed by a court order.
  3. The disclosure is made to medical personnel in a medical emergency or to designated and qualified staff for research, audit, or program evaluation.

Federal law and regulations do not protect any information about a crime committed by a patient either at the program or against any person who works for the program or about any threat to commit such a crime. 

Federal laws and regulations do not protect any information about suspected child abuse or neglect from being reported under State law to appropriate state or local authorities.

Violation of the federal law and regulations by a program is a crime. Suspected violations may be reported to appropriate authorities in accordance with federal regulations.  
INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO ACCESS PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION  
The individual patient/client has a right to access, inspect and obtain a copy of his/her protected health information (pursuant to 45 CFR Part 164.524) for as long as that designated record set is maintained by the facility. Access will be accorded within 30 days of the request, except in where legally specified reasons for denial exist. If access is denied for cause, such denial may be reviewed and appealed. 

For further HIPAA-relevant Privacy information see the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS) CMS [website](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/).

We reserve the right to change our practices and to make the new provisions effective for all protected health information we maintain. Should our information practices change, we will post a revised notice to this website.

If you believe your privacy rights have been violated, you can file a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services/ Office for Civil Rights (HHS/OCR) by email at [info@hhs.gov](mailto:ocrcomplaint@hhs.gov) or by calling the national Office at 202-205-8725 and asking for the OCR Health Information Privacy Complaint Form and/or for the appropriate Regional OCR Office.

However, communications that are sent directly to the Department of HHS/OCR are maintained by them for historical purposes, as required by law. Those communications are archived on a monthly basis, but are also protected by the Privacy Act, which restricts their use while permitting certain disclosures. There will be no retaliation for filing a complaint.
