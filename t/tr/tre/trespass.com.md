We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent.

If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) we will always obtain your consent first. 

We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening. The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings.

We fully respect your right to privacy and recognise the importance of ensuring the security of that information. We will not collect any personal information about you on this website without your clear permission.

Our policy is applicable to the www.trespass.co.uk website only. Once you have left our site our terms do not apply.

This policy may change in accordance with legislation, law, or changes to the business or website. Please ensure that you revisit this policy regularly and familiarise yourself with its terms.

### Our Company

The website is owned and operated by Jacobs & Turner LTD, a company registered in Scotland under company number SC047678. The registered office is located at Vermont House, 149 Vermont Street, Kinning Park, Glasgow, G41 1LU. All content on the website is owned by Jacobs & Turner LTD.

### How We Collect Information

### Cookies

The Trespass website uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website. It allows the website to recognise you as a user and remember the information you have given.

We use two types of cookies on our site; session cookies and persistent cookies. Neither of these save information that identifies you personally.

Both types are used to track movement of customers from page to page allowing for site statistics to be collated.

A session cookie only lasts as long as your visit to the site. These are used to aid functionality of pages including the shopping basket by remembering the various items you have added and allows you to continue shopping and return to it at a later time. Once your ‘session’ has ended these cookies are deleted.

A persistent cookie will remain on your hard drive until it is deleted. These are used to remember your details when you revisit the website. For example: your login username or items in your basket from a previous visit. If you choose to stay logged in, this cookie expires after 30 days and is removed, if you do not choose to stay logged in everything is removed at the end of the session.

To analyse site statistics and traffic we use Google Analytics. Again persistent cookies are used by this tool, but do not store any information identifying you personally. The information is collected purely for statistical and analytical purposes, evaluating each visitor’s use of the website. The cookies used by Google Analytics store IP addresses, again for statistical purposes, but cannot be linked to an individual user via our website. This tool helps us to learn how you use the website and how we can improve it for you.

The majority of web browsers will give you the option to turn off or disable cookies by adjusting the settings of the browser. The instructions for this process can usually be found in the Help menu of the browser. However, please note that our website, as with most ecommerce sites, will lose functionality which means you may not be able to proceed with a purchase once cookies have been turned off. For further information about cookies please visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

###  The Information Collected

Our website collects data in a variety of forms, including cookies as mentioned above, using our online forms, through the purchase of products, and as site traffic information.

As a rule, we only collate information required to improve our service to you as a customer. All data requested by us is voluntary and you can provide us with as much or little information as you wish. For example, our e-Newsletters are for subscribers only and customers can unsubscribe at any time.

For the purposes of tracking traffic flow to and around the website, we store information including:-

  * Your IP address
  * The top-level domain name used (for example .ie, .com, .org, .net)
  * The previous website visited, including any search terms used
  * Click stream data which shows the pages visited on the website
  * The type of web browser used by the website visitor
  * However none of this information can identify you personally. As already explained, we use Google Analytics to track and analyse these site statistics.



### How the Information Is Used

As mentioned above, we retain your information to improve our services and make the website as easy to use as possible.

We will only share the information outlined in ‘The Information Collected’ section above in the circumstances detailed below.

  * When required to do by law enforcement or regulatory bodies.
  * To suppliers out with our organisation, such as IT providers. However, all suppliers must comply with our privacy policy and are obliged to ensure complete confidentiality of any data passed to them.



We will not disclose your information to any other third parties, unless specified above. The technical information will be used only by Intelligent Data Services, and only for statistical and other administrative purposes. You should note that technical details, which we cannot associate with any identifiable individual, do not constitute "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts, 1988 & 2003.

Any information provided by you will be kept in the strictest confidence, only authorised suppliers and personnel will have access to it. All persons with access to your data must comply with our privacy policy and adhere to our security measures against unauthorised or unlawful use of the information and against accidental loss, damage or destruction.
