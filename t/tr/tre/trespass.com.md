  * **For our own legitimate interests**   
We may require your data to pursue our legitimate interests as part of running our business (and which does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests). **For example** , we will use your purchase history to send you or make available offers. We also combine our customers’ shopping history to identify trends and ensure we can satisfy demands, or develop new products/services. 
  * **To comply with a legal obligation**   
**For example** , we can pass on details (to law enforcement) of people involved in fraud or other criminal activity affecting Trespass. 
  * **Based on your consent**   
**For example** , when you request us to pass on your personal data to other people or organisations such as a company handling an order/service on your behalf; or to send you marketing communications where we’ve asked for your consent to do so. 



## How we use your personal data and why:

  * **To respond** to queries and refund requests. We do this on the basis of our contractual obligations to you, our legal obligations and our legitimate interests. 
  * **To process** online/instore orders. We collect your personal data to process your order and comply with our legal obligations.

  * **To share** website content that’s tailored to your interests (we’ll use data we hold about your favourite products etc.).
  * **To develop** , test and improve the systems, services and products we provide to you. We’ll do this on the basis of our legitimate business interests.
  * **To safeguard** our business and your account from fraud and other illegal activities. We do this as part of our legitimate interest. 
  * **To protect** our customers, premises, assets and staff from crime (our CCTV systems record images for security). We do this for legitimate business interests.
  * **To prevent** fraudulent transactions. We do this on the basis of our legitimate business interest (also helps to protect customers from fraud).

**By doing all of this we form a better picture of you (your likes and dislikes) – and in turn you will enjoy the best possible customer experience.** We use this data to offer you promotions, products and services that are most likely to interest you. The data privacy law allows this as part of our legitimate interest in understanding our customers.
