Promotions that run on our sites may be sponsored by companies other than TrekkSoft, or may be co-sponsored by TrekkSoft and another company. Some or all of your personal information that is collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If you do not want your information to be shared, you must not participate in the promotion. Many promotions also offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors.

If you link from our site to any advertiser or merchant site for purchases or other interaction, the information obtained during your visit to those merchants, and the information you give such as your credit card number and contact information, is available to those merchants and is subject to their privacy policies. TrekkSoft has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies and the information practices of those advertisers, merchants, and other web sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

## Security

While no security system is 100% guaranteed, TrekkSoft utilizes several state-of-the-art tools to protect your information. Strict security measures are employed whenever your personal information is collected and transmitted.

Your TrekkSoft account information and TrekkSoft profiles are password protected so that only you have access to your personal information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Also remember to sign out of your TrekkSoft account and close your browser window when you have finished your work, especially if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe to help prevent others from accessing your personal information and correspondence.

In addition to password protection, TrekkSoft employs cutting edge encryption standards (such as secure sockets layer (SSL)) to ensure that particularly sensitive data, such as community and commerce registration and profile information and all related product ordering and product management transactions, exchanged between your computer and our servers is secure. In these highly secure areas of the sight, both our servers and your computer encrypt the data before it is transferred across the Internet. We take these measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information.

Keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.
