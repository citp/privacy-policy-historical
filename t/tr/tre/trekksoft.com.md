### 7\. Data security

When our website is visited we use the SSL method (Secure Socket Layer) in conjunction with the highest level of encryption that is supported by your browser.

You can see whether a particular page of our website is transmitted encrypted from the closed-form display of the key or padlock icon in the bottom status bar of your browser.

We also apply appropriate technical and organisational security measures to safeguard your data from accidental or deliberate manipulation, complete or partial loss, destruction or access by unauthorised third parties. Our security measures are continually being improved in line with technological progress.

### 10\. Social media plug-ins

We use social plug-ins for social media on our website based on Art. 6(1) sentence 1(f) DS-GVO. The underlying promotional aim is deemed a legitimate interest within the meaning of the DS-GVO. Responsibility for compliance with data protection rules lies with the particular provider concerned.

We currently use the following social media plug-ins: LinkedIn, Xing, and Facebook. We apply the so-called two-click solution. This means that, in principle, when you visit our site no personal data will initially be forwarded to plug-in providers. You can identify the plug-in provider from the labels on the field, from its initial letters or logo. We give you an opportunity of communicating with the plug-in provider direct using the button. It is only if you click on the selected field and therefore activate it that the plug-in provider receives the information that you have accessed our online service website. The data referred to in paragraph 2.1 of this Privacy Statement is also transmitted. In the case of Facebook and Xing the IP address recorded is anonymised immediately as stated by the respective provider in Germany. By activating the plug-in, therefore, personal data is sent by you to the plug-in provider concerned and stored there (for USA providers in the USA). As the plug-in provider gathers data using cookies in particular we recommend that you delete all cookies via your browser security settings before clicking on the greyed-out field.

We do not have any influence on the data collected or data processing operations, nor are we made aware of the full extent of the data collection, the purpose of processing or retention periods. We do not hold any information on the deletion of gathered data by the plug-in provider either.

The plug-in provider stores the data collected about you as usage profiles and uses it for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or demand-oriented design of its website. This kind of evaluation is especially undertaken (even for users not logged on) to present demand-oriented advertising and to inform other users of the social network of your activity on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of such user profiles although in order to exercise that right you have to turn to the respective plug-in provider. With plug-ins we give you an opportunity to interact with social media and other users so that we can improve our services and make things more interesting for you, the user. The legitimacy of our use of plug-ins is based on Art. 6(1) sentence 1(f) DS-GVO.

Data is transferred irrespective of whether you have an account with the plug-in provider and are logged on there. When you are logged on to the plug-in provider your data which we hold is allocated direct to your account with the plug-in provider. When you click on the activated button and link to the site, for example, the plug-in provider saves that information as well in your user account and openly informs your contacts. We recommend that after using a social network you generally log out, particularly before activating the button, as in this way you will be able to avoid allocation to your profile with the plug-in provider.

You can obtain further information on the purpose and scope of data collection and its processing by plug-in providers in the plug-in providers’ privacy statements detailed below. These also contain further information on your rights and setting options in that respect to protect your privacy.
