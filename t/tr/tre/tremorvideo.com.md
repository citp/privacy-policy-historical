### PRIVACY POLICY FOR TREMOR VIDEO’S SERVICES

What does Tremor Video do?

Tremor Video is an online video advertising software company. Tremor Video’s advertiser customers engage us to display their video ads in streaming content that is featured on websites and applications across the Internet, including content that is viewable on mobile devices, tablets and TVs.  Sellers utilize our solutions to improve their yield and maximize the value of their video advertising inventory.

How does Tremor Video’s software select the video ads that I see?

Tremor Video’s proprietary ad serving software displays video ads, typically immediately before or during the streaming of featured content on a website or application. The video ad is provided to Tremor Video by an advertiser, and the featured content is shown on the websites and applications of a content provider.

Our advertisers may specify where, when, and in what context they want their video ads to be displayed. These specifications are sometimes called targeting parameters.

Tremor Video uses its proprietary ad serving software to target, select and deliver ads according to the advertisers’ specifications. In order to optimize the delivery of a video ad, Tremor Video’s software collects and analyzes information provided by the website or application publisher, by the user’s computer or device, and advertiser, among other sources, which, in turn, is automatically recorded (logged) by the  servers of Tremor Video. Examples of the types of information we may collect and store in the server logs are the following: browser type and language, operating system, Internet Protocol address (for example, to identify a user’s general location), page URL and referral URL, video player size, video content (such as video title, description, category), date and time of request, internet service provider (such as Verizon FiOS), and advertising cookies.  When selecting, targeting and delivering ads, Tremor Video does not actively collect, and does not use or store personally identifiable information about a user.

Tremor Video’s ad serving software may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to select, target, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, including when determining what ads to present so that they may best relate to the possible preferences and interests of users based on information collected across multiple websites that they visit. We call this practice of collecting data about a user’s online activities to deliver advertising targeted to a user’s likely interests “interest-based advertising.”

A “cookie” is generally a small text file that is sent to a user’s computer. Cookies are commonly assigned by online services, such as websites or ad technologies, to recognize a computer that they have encountered before. A cookie is associated with a specific site domain, a specific computer, and a specific Internet browser program. Our advertising cookies operate anonymously: we do not use them to gather the user’s name, street address, e-mail address, or telephone number(s).

A “web beacon” is a small piece of code placed on web pages that can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit the web page, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing that page.

How does Tremor Video deliver ads to mobile applications?

In the case of advertisements targeted, selected, and delivered to mobile applications, for example, apps on a smartphone, the Tremor Video software may collect information provided by the user’s mobile device, including certain unique mobile operating system advertising IDs, such as Apple’s Identifier for Advertising ID (IDFA) or Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID) to target, select, and deliver advertisements.  Other examples of information we may collect to target, select and deliver advertisements may be the type of the mobile device and the location of a mobile device if a user enables collection of precise location data through the available features on that mobile device.

How does Tremor Video recognize a user across multiple devices? 

Tremor Video’s software may, in some cases, be able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular computer or device may be correlated with the same Tremor Video identifier (e.g., cookie, advertising IDs, IP address) that we have previously associated to another computer or device. In such cases, Tremor Video’s software may be able to infer that a device (e.g _._ a computer) and another device (e.g. a smartphone) are used by the same user. Where such an inference can be made, we may use this information to target, select and deliver ads across multiple computers and devices. This is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising.

What are examples of ad choices Tremor Video offers to users?

  * Opt out of Tremor Video’s cookie used for interest-based advertising by clicking on the “[Opt Out](https://www.tremorvideo.com/privacy-policy)” button at the top of this page.
  * Opt out of cookies used for interest-based advertising by a number of online advertising companies at the [Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Opt-Out Page for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).
  * Manage the settings on your smartphone. Find out how you may opt of mobile application interest - based advertising at the [Mobile App Opt - Out Guide](https://www.tremorvideo.com/mobile-app-opt-out-guide) for more information. Please be aware that your smartphone may not offer the same features.
  * Set your browser to reject cookies, and remove the cookies that have already been placed. Find out how at [All About Cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) for more information.



Four things to know about opting out:

  * You will still see video ads from Tremor Video after you opt out. However, the ads that you see will be less relevant to you.
  * You will need to opt out separately for each browser and each device. There is not a single opt out that governs all your browsers and devices.
  * If you change your browser or device, you will need to opt out again for each new browser and device. The new browser and device does not inherit your prior settings.
  * If you delete the opt out cookie from your browser, you will need to opt out again from that browser.



How do we use third-party service providers?

Tremor Video and its advertisers may use third-party ad service providers to help deliver advertisements. These ad service providers use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies to select, target, deliver, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, including when determining what ads to present so that they may best relate to the possible preferences and interests of users. Tremor Video may use data that ad service providers collect in the delivery of interest-based advertisements. This data is non-personally identifiable information and is used to deliver advertisements that may be more relevant to a user.

Tremor Video may share non-personally identifiable information about users gathered by means of cookies, web beacons, or other technologies, including anonymous identifiers used in connection with mobile applications, with certain ad service providers so that they can help Tremor Video deliver more relevant advertisements, including for cross - device advertising. The use of cookies, web beacons, or other technologies by other ad service providers is subject to their respective privacy policies, and not by the privacy policy of Tremor Video. You can find out more about ad service providers and the choices you have about their technologies by clicking on the links at the bottom of this privacy policy. Similarly, the publishers to which we deliver an ad are subject to their own privacy policies and not the privacy policy of Tremor Video.

Is information transferred to Tremor Video successors and affiliates?

Tremor Video may transfer or assign the information it collects in connection with its business to any successor-in-interest to Tremor Video (such as a company that acquires Tremor Video), or internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary or parent). Tremor Video may also disclose information if it determines that an applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or if Tremor Video determines that it needs to share such information to protect or enforce Tremor Video’s rights or the rights of our customers or another user.
