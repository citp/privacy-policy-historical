**FOR THE TREMOR VIDEO NETWORK SERVICES**

WHAT DOES TREMOR VIDEO DO?  
Tremor Video is an online advertising company that offers advertisers opportunities to display their interactive or video ads on top-tier websites, including mobile websites, and mobile applications. Our services streamline the selection and delivery of interactive and video ads for advertisers and web publishers. 

HOW DOES TREMOR VIDEO DELIVER ADS?  
Ads delivered by Tremor Video appear primarily in two contexts as follows:  
(i) in an ad banner or other ad unit on a web page (“in-page ads”) and (ii) as part of a video stream through a player, widget or application (“in-stream ads”).

Most of our advertisers’ ads are delivered by Tremor Video proprietary or AdTech technology. AdTech is a third party technology service provider who is our agent for delivering certain of our advertisers’ advertisements.

HOW ARE ADS SELECTED FOR DELIVERY?  
Tremor Video’s customers are advertisers that ask us to display their ads on websites and applications affiliated with Tremor Video (“Tremor Video Network”). Advertisers may specify where, when and in what context they want their ads to be displayed. These specifications are sometimes called targeting parameters.

Tremor Video uses its proprietary or AdTech ad serving technology to select, target and deliver ads according to the advertisers’ specifications. In order to select an ad, the ad serving technology will receive information provided by the web publisher, user’s browser, and advertiser which, in turn, is automatically recorded by the servers of Tremor Video and/or AdTech. This information is usually non-personally identifiable, although some web publishers or advertisers may also incidentally provide to Tremor Video personally-identifiable information about a user. Tremor Video does not actively collect, and does not use or store personally identifiable information about a user on the Tremor Video Network. 

The Tremor Video proprietary and/or AdTech ad serving technology may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies in order to select, target, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, including when determining what ads to present so that they may best relate to the preferences of users on the Tremor Video Network. A “cookie” is generally a small text file that is sent to a user’s computer. Cookies are commonly assigned by online services, such as websites or ad technologies, to recognize a computer that they have encountered before. A cookie is associated with a specific site domain, a specific computer and a specific Internet browser program. A “web beacon” is a small piece of code placed on web pages that can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit the web page, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing that page.

In the case of advertisements selected, targeted and delivered to mobile websites and applications, the ad serving technology may also receive information provided by the user’s mobile device, including a unique device ID. Tremor Video changes the unique device ID into an anonymous ID. 

In addition, Tremor Video uses Adobe Systems Incorporated Flash cookies for functionality purposes in connection with Tremor Video’s (i) ad management platform and (ii) advertisers’ ad units. 

Tremor Video and its advertisers may also use third-party ad service providers to help present advertisements on the Tremor Video Network. These ad service providers use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to select, target, deliver, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements to determine or predict the characteristics and user preferences. Tremor Video may use data that ad service providers collect to help present interest-based advertisements. This data is non-personally identifiable information and is used to make advertisements more relevant. 

Tremor Video may share non-personally identifiable information about users gathered by means of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies with certain ad service providers so that they can help Tremor Video deliver more relevant advertisements. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by other ad service providers is subject to their respective privacy policies, not the privacy policy of Tremor Video. You can find out more about ad service providers and the choices you have about these technologies by clicking on the links at the bottom of this privacy policy. Similarly, the publishers that comprise the Tremor Video Network are subject to their own privacy policies and not the privacy policy of Tremor Video.

IS INFORMATION TRANSFERRED TO TREMOR VIDEO SUCCESSORS AND AFFILIATES?  
Tremor Video may transfer the information it collects in connection with its business to any successor-in-interest to Tremor Video (such as a company that acquires Tremor Video), or internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary or parent). Tremor Video may also disclose information if it determines that an applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires it, or if Tremor Video determines that it needs to share such information to protect or enforce Tremor Video’s rights or the rights of another user.
