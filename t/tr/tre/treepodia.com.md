How We Generally Use the Information
We use the information we collect, first, to better provide you with the Websites, the Platform
and the videos therein. We put together all the information available to us to maximize the
relevance and quality of the Website and Platform's videos and content. For example, we use the
information that we collect in order to: (a) provide personalized advertising, content and
information to our users; (b) monitor and improve the effectiveness of the Websites and
Platform's videos and content and our clients' marketing; (c) monitor aggregate metrics and
statistical information regarding the Websites and Platform and their users; and (d) diagnose or
fix technology problems reported by our clients, users or engineers.
We also use the information we collect for purposes of administering and improving the
Websites and the Platform, monitoring users' activities and purchases during and/or subsequent
to their use of the Platform, making available more relevant videos and content to our users and
prospective users, and enabling Third Party Websites, clients and advertisers to deliver general
and targeted ad and video content to you.
Occasionally, we may also use your contact information (if provided by you through your
contacts with us) to contact you and notify you about new services and special opportunities we
think you will find valuable, on our behalf and on behalf of our partners. We may contact you
by phone, mail or email (if you have provided us with such information), as well as through the
Websites, the Platform, and other similar channels. By providing us with your contact
information you consent to our use of such contract information to send you such notices, and
any notices required by law. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish us to send you
promotional communications, by emailing us at unsubscribe@treepodia.com, or by clicking
"unsubscribe" in the message.
We may provide third parties with certain information about you without identifying you as an
individual. We do this for purposes such as (1) providing our clients, advertisers and advertising
agencies with information that allows them to present targeted personalized ads and promotions;
(2) providing our clients and advertisers with information required to diagnose and resole any
commercial and accounting issues with regards to the Platform and its users; (3) providing
statistical and aggregated data to researchers and other data consumers; (4) analyzing how the
Platform is used; (5) diagnosing and resolving technical problems; (6) maintaining security. We
reserve the right to use and disclose any anonymized information at our discretion.


Personally Identifying Information
The information you provide us will include Personally Identifying Information ("PII") which is
information that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate or otherwise identify you.
We do not collect PII except when provided voluntarily by you directly. We do not rent, sell or
disseminate PII to third parties without your consent, other than:
   disclosure to our employees, consultants, contractors, business partners, clients, service
    providers and suppliers. Such disclosure is normally subject to the recipient's undertaking of
    confidentiality obligations and the prevention of any independent right to use this
    information by the recipients, except as required to help us provide the Website and the
    Platform.
   to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant
    or other lawful request for information we receive, whether or not a response is required by
    applicable law;
   to enforce an agreement or to protect our rights;
   with any of our parent, or affiliated or successor entity;
   to consummate, and as part of, any asset sale, transfer, merger or liquidation;
We only provide data to our advertising partners after we have removed your name or any other
personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way
that it is no longer associated with you. As stated above, we may allow third-party advertising
agencies and networks to serve advertisements, or may ourselves serve advertisements, through
the Websites and/or Platform. Such ads may be based on the information provided to us, other
than the PII. We do not provide any PII to such advertising agencies and networks. However,
please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain type of users or
audience, and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that
you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. You should consult the respective
privacy policies of advertising agencies and networks. This Policy does not apply to, and we
cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Any solicitation of personal information
through such advertisements is strictly between the advertiser and you.
You may choose voluntarily whether or not to provide us with your PII. Notices provided at the
Platform and the Websites where we collect PII should help you to make this choice. If you
choose to avoid provision of your PII as we request it, you may be unable to access and use
certain options, offers and services available through the Websites and/or Platform and/or that
involve our interaction with you. You may request access to all your voluntarily-provided PII


that we collected online and maintain in our database by sending a written request to
info@treepodia.com.
Deactivation and Deletion of Your Information
If you want to delete or remove your PII stored with us permanently, you may send an e-mail to
unsubscribe@treepodia.com. Please include "Delete my Information" in the subject line and
your full name and e-mail address in the body of the e-mail. We will respond to your request in
a timely manner, normally within thirty (30) days. Upon such request, we will make our best
efforts to remove all your PII from our database. However, please note that some information
may not be deleted from all databases and backup records. We may also retain certain PII for
client and user service, legal and similar purposes. We reserve the right to keep all non-PII and
continue to use such non-PII in accordance with this Policy after the deletion of all your PII.
Information Security
We use industry standard measures to ensure the security of all information, including the use of
passwords, firewalls, encryption and remote servers, and routinely evaluate our practices to
identify security threats or opportunities for the improvement of our Website and Platform.
However, no transmission of information is guaranteed to be completely secure.
Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may
compromise information security. You acknowledge and agree to assume this risk when
using the Websites and Platform and/or when communicating with us.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or
knowingly allow such persons to use the Websites and Platform. If you are under 13, please do
not use any of the Websites and Platform and do not send any information about yourself to us.
No one under the age of 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to us. In the event
that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without
verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you
believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us
promptly at info@treepodia.com.
