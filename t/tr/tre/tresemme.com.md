INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy applies only to the TRESemmé web site, [http:/www.tresemme.com](http://www.tresemme.com/) which is owned or controlled by Alberto Culver Company ("Alberto Culver," "we" or "us"), or other interactive features or downloads that are owned or controlled by Alberto Culver and made available through the Site or that interact with the Site and post this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Site and does not cover any information collected at any other web site or offline by Alberto Culver (unless specifically stated). This Privacy Policy explains Alberto Culver's information collection practices at the Site, such as the types of information Alberto Culver collects regarding visitors to the Site and how we may use that information. Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Site's _[Terms of Use](http://www.alberto.com/terms-US-tresemme.htm)_ , which governs your use of the Site.

THE INFORMATION THE SITES COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

Information You Provide Us

The Site may ask you to provide personally identifiable information, which is information that could be used to contact you or identify you personally, such as your name, birth date, or e-mail address ("Personal Information") and other information about you, such as demographic information (your gender, zip code or similar information) or certain information about your hobbies, preferences and interests. The Site may collect Personal Information and other information about you at various places and forms on the Site, including registration forms, when you submit a question to us, or when you otherwise communicate or interact with us. If we combine demographic or similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. 

Alberto Culver may use your Personal Information: (1) to provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive; (2) to process your registration with the Site, including verifying your email address is active and valid; (3) to improve the Site or our services, to customize your experience on the Site, or to serve you specific content that is most relevant to you; (3) to contact you with regard to your use of the Site and, in our discretion, changes to the Site policies; (4) for internal business purposes; and (5) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information. 

If you submit ideas, votes, comments, reviews, suggestions, photographs, videos, music, text or other content to the Site, it may be published online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed). Others may have access to this content and may have the ability to share it with third parties across the Internet. Alberto Culver may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personally Information with the content (or any portion of the content), and Alberto Culver may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities. For full terms and conditions regarding user-generated content you submit to the Site, please review the Site's _[Terms of Use](http://www.alberto.com/terms-US-tresemme.htm)_.

Please note that information submitted to the Site via a "contact us" or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise. 

Your Public Profile

If you register to join the Site's online community ("Member"), you may create a public profile that includes your username, your personal photo, and your location, as well as other information that you choose to post about yourself ("Profile"). This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you disclose publicly or otherwise upload onto your Profile. In addition, the Site may post publicly information about your use of the Site as a Member, including information about the posts you submit or view, how others rank your posts, and other information about your use of the community features on the Site. If you post Personal Information through blogs, message boards or other public forums the Site may make available, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. Alberto Culver cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding what information to include in your Profile and when deciding to disclose Personal Information in any public areas of the Site. 

You may edit most of the information you have supplied for your Profile by logging in and going into "My Profile." You may request removal of your Profile from the Site by contacting us through the "Contact Us" feature on the Site.

Information You Provide About A Third Party

If you send someone else communication from the Site, such as sending an article to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person. 

Information Third Parties Provide About You

We also may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal identifiable information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personally identifiable information. 

Information We Collect As You Access And Use The Site 

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to provide to us on the Site, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically collect certain web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Site. This information may include browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page view, among other information. We may use this web site usage information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Site. In addition, your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to as a "Device Identifier") may be collected. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal information you provide. 

The methods that may be used to collect this information include the following: 

_Cookies_. A cookie is a data file placed on a computer when it is used to visit the Site. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the Site. You may disable cookies using your browser's preferences, but some features of the Site may not function properly or may operate slowly if you disable the cookies. 

_Web Beacons_. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons, (also known as "1x1 GIFs " or "clear GIFs,)" may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. 

_Embedded Scripts._ An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as which links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our Web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.   
Information collected through automatic means may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. If associated with you, it will be treated as Personal Information. 

HOW AND WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

Alberto Culver may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties. We do not share your Personal Information with third parties for those third parties' marketing purposes unless you consent to such sharing at the time you provide your Personal Information. We may share the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. 

When You Agree To Receive Information From Third Parties. You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from third party(s). If you do not agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will not be shared with such third party(s) for direct marketing purposes. If you do agree to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to such third party(s) and all information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third party(s). We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third party(s) and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and practices of such third party(s) prior to agreeing to receive such information from third party(s). If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.

Third Parties Providing Services on our Behalf. We may use third party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of the Site, such as hosting the Site, designing and/or operating the Site's features, tracking Site analytics, enabling Alberto Culver to send you e-mail, or performing other administrative services. We may provide these companies with access to user information, including Personal Information, if necessary to carry out the services they are performing for you or for Alberto Culver. 

Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a "Promotion") through the Site that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.

Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may also transfer and disclose user information, including Personal Information, to third parties: (i) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; or (iii) to protect and/or defend the Site's Terms of Use [LINK] or other policies applicable to the Site or to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any individual. We may also use IP address or other Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.

Business Transfers. Alberto Culver may share Personal Information with its subsidiaries and affiliates for internal reasons. Alberto Culver also reserves the right to disclose and transfer all information related to the Site, including Personal Information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Site or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of Alberto Culver's stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process. 

NOTICE TO PARENTS

The Site is a general audience web site and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13). We will delete any Personal Information collected that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of thirteen (13). 

CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION AND SUBSCRIPTIONS AND QUESTIONS

You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration.

THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES

The Site may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect web site usage information and your Device Identifier when web pages from the Site are served to your browser. In addition, the Site may contain links to other third party web sites that Alberto Culver does not control. Alberto Culver is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any third party web site. For example, if you "click" on a link from an Alberto Culver partner, the "click" may take you off the Site onto a different web site. This includes links from sponsors and partners that may reference the Site or the Site's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. Alberto Culver encourages you to note when you leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of all third party web sites before submitting any Personal Information to those sites. 

THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS

Third party applications may be available via the Site. The owners of these applications ("Third Party Owners") may collect Personal Information from you and may have their own policies and practices. Alberto Culver does not screen or pre-approve Third Party Owners or their applications and Alberto Culver has no control over how Third Party Owners or their applications use your Personal Information. These Third Party Owners may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. Alberto Culver is not responsible for these policies or the practices of Third Party Owners. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third party application or otherwise interacting with it.
