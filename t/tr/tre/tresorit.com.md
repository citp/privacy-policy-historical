For Tresorit, security and data privacy are of paramount importance. This Privacy Policy details our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals in accordance with the GDPR.

The main content on the left contains the legally binding full-length version. To help you understand our Privacy Policy better, we collected some helpful notes on the right to sum up the key points of the main content.

## Our Data Privacy Commitment

In a nutshell

Our mission is to make privacy and security available to people and businesses. That’s why we use end-to-end encryption to protect files and folders you share and store in the cloud.

We encrypt all and every transmission containing personal data using Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) and apply additional, client-side encryption on the files and directories uploaded and stored in protected storage folders (the Encrypted Content).

We never collect or store your files, encryption keys and passwords in an unencrypted or invertible form. The Encrypted Content and corresponding encryption keys can only be decrypted by you and persons with whom you explicitly share them. However, if you have an account that is part of a Business Domain with recovery master key, Your Encrypted Content may also be accessed by your Subscription Owner.

According to the best of Tresorit’s knowledge, the current state of the art and the public knowledge of the human race, Tresorit is unable to decrypt the Encrypted Content and accordingly, Tresorit cannot access it. As a result, we cannot use Your Encrypted Content to identify any individual.

However, when using the service, creating and using your user account, you also submit some non-encrypted data, which may include personal data as well.

Even though we can’t read or access the files and folders you store in Tresorit, we need to process some of your personal data to provide you with services.

## Who will process your personal data?

Tresorit services are provided by Tresorit AG (company registration no: CH-300.3.017.920-5; address: Minervastrasse 3, 8032 Zurich) (Tresorit), a company registered under the laws of Switzerland. If you have a subsciption with Tresorit as an individual user, Tresorit will be the controller of your personal data under EU law.

Your data is processed by Tresorit. However, if you are a part of a business subscription, certain data is processed upon the instructions of your organization.

If your account is part of a Business Domain in accordance with section III of our Terms, in certain cases, the ultimate decisions regarding your personal data will be made by your organisation. In such case, your company will be considered as a controller and Tresorit will act as a processor, acting upon the instructions of your organisation.

In any case, certain activites of Tresorit are outsourced to third parties (processors), they may also use your personal data when acting on behalf of Tresorit. You can find more details about our sub-processors [here](https://support.tresorit.com/hc/en-us/articles/216114397-Third-party-services).

## What kind of personal data do we process?

### A) Data that you provide to us

**Registration information.** When you register for our services, you submit some non-encrypted identification and contact data (such as your e-mail address, name, job title or position, address, phone number). The data that we request at the time of registration is necessary for the provision of our services.

Certain basic information, like your name and email address, is necessary for setting up a Tresorit account.

**Billing Information.** At the time of registration, you also need to provide us certain billing information. You might also provide payment information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services. This data is necessary in order to provide you Tresorit services.

When you purchase a subscription, you also need to provide payment information, which will be handled by secure processing services.

**Account information.** When you use our services, you provide us access to certain information (such as the name and the permission history of your Tresorit Folders) that is necessary for the provision and maintenance of your user account. For the avoidance of any doubt, Tresorit cannot connect such metadata information to Your Encrypted Content or file names as Tresorit has no access to the Encrypted Content or file names.

In order to send and deliver invitations upon your instructions, Tresorit stores and accesses certain personal data (such as the email address, name, Tresor name and its unique URL, storage account and username of the inviter and the invited person). Please note that your email address, first and last name are visible to others when you send them an invitation to, or if you accept an invitation.

Some information about your Tresorit Folders is unencrypted, like its name, size and members. This is needed for features like your activity wall.

**Other Information.** You may decide to share further information, including personal data, with us when you contact our Support or Sales Teams, submit forms on our website or otherwise communicate with us. It is solely your decision to share any detailed, non-aggregated logs (which may contain e.g. non-encrypted filenames), your screen or any other data with us during such communications, so our processing of such data will be based on your consent.

Sometimes, when you require assistance from our Sales and Support teams, you may choose to share additional information with us.

**Information that we collect about you on our website.** When you visit our website, we and our partners may use cookies and other information gathering technologies for a variety of purposes.

We store access data without direct personal references, namely the visitor’s browser types, the name of your internet service provider, the website from which you have visited us, the name of the requested file, the Tresorit client version you download, and internet protocol addresses.

Unless you choose to identify yourself, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account or filling out a web form, this data does not allow us to draw any conclusions regarding your identity. By storing and analyzing such information, we are able to create in-depth analysis about our service, which is essential for improvement, security and debugging purposes.

We collect data from our website visitors – we can’t identify you directly without your consent.

**Logs.** As most websites and services provided through the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our website or service.

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, operating system, identification numbers associated with your devices, time of access, and error logs.

We log website visits and application usage statistics to improve our services.

**Analytics.** When you download and use our services, we automatically collect information such as the type of device you use, operating system version, your Tresorit client version and the IP addresses associated with you.

### B) Information that we collect from third parties

**Other users of our services.** Other users of Tresorit services may provide information about you while using our service. For example, we receive personal data about you when somebody sends you an invitation or add you to their contacts. Similarly, your Subscription Owner may provide your contact information when they designate you as a user under your company’s policy.

We also receive personal data when new users are invited to a business subscription or to a Tresorit Folder.

**Our resellers and distributors.** From time to time, we engage trusted business partners who help us generate leads, and market, promote and resell our product. We receive information from these partners, such as billing information, contact information, company name and registered address.

**Other partners.** We receive information about you and your activities on our website from third-party partners, such as advertising partners. Upon your consent, such partners provide us with information about your engagement with our website and online advertisements.

We will share your personal data with third parties only in accordance with this policy. We will never sell your personal data to third parties. However, we may need to share some information, including personal data, we obtain from your use of our service in the following circumstances.

In certain cases, we may need to oblige to national security or law enforcement requirements and provide personal data to authorities.

### 2) Using third-party service providers

In certain cases we need to share information, including personal data with our third-party service providers. We use third-party service providers for a number of services, including application development, backup, storage, payment processing, analytics and other services. We require our third-party service providers to use the personal data that we share with them solely in connection with the services they provide to us. The current list of our service providers is available [here](https://support.tresorit.com/hc/en-us/articles/216114397-Third-party-services).

As any other business, we may need to share personal data with other service providers that we use in our operation for billing, backup, analytics etc.

### 3) Sharing content by you

We may also share personal data with third parties when we have your consent to do so. For example, information, including personal data, will be shared with a third-party when you share content using our service with a third party (e.g. through share links and collaborating in Tresorit Folders). When you share content or content is shared with you – either by accepting, downloading, assessing a Tresorit link or invitation –, your activity, relevant metadata of file edits or downloads, might also be disclosed to the shared party. You acknowledge that once you shared all or a part of Your Encrypted Content by using our service with any person who accepted your invitation, such content goes out of your control and remains accessible to the extent you granted access. Accordingly, we ask you to pay special attention with whom you share Your Encrypted Content.

When you are a member of a shared folder, besides its content, your activity will also be visible to other members.

### 4) Your Subscription Owner

## Where do we transfer your data?

We primarily store personal data within the EEA. Your personal data stored with us may also be transferred to countries outside of the EU. All such transfers of personal data are and will be made in accordance with applicable laws.
