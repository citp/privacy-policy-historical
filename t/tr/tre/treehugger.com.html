<h1>Privacy</h1>
<div id="page-content"><p><strong>Privacy</strong><br></p>
<p></p><p>Your privacy is important to us. TreeHugger.com has prepared these privacy and security policies ("Statement") so you may better understand how TreeHugger.com ("our Website") may use your personal information in connection with our Website and services, as well as how it protects your information against unauthorized use. Please take the time to review this Statement and contact us with any questions or concerns.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</strong><br><br>Personal Information<br><br>TreeHugger.com may ask you to register and provide personal information in certain instances, such as when you make a comment to a story or when you contact our customer support group. Personally identifiable information that we may collect includes your name and email address.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong>Children's Personal Information</strong><br><br>TreeHugger.com does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13. If we find out that we have such personal information, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong>Website Usage Information</strong><br><br>TreeHugger.com tracks navigational data (log files, server logs, click-stream) and information about how our Website is used by you (through cookies, Internet tags, or web beacons). We also collect information such as the URL of the Website you previously visited and the time of day that you use our Website. TreeHugger.com also keeps track of the pages you visit within our Website as well as any transaction details (downloads, orders, requests, or referrals). You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent, or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but in such cases certain features of our Website might not function as expected.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong>Third-Party Ad-serving Companies</strong><br><br>On our Website, we will display third-party advertisements. While many of these advertisements are displayed by TreeHugger.com, we may allow third-party ad-serving companies or ad networks to display advertisements on our Website. Some of these ad networks may place a persistent cookie in order to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. Thus, third party ad-serving companies or ad networks may compile information about where you are using your computer, where you saw their advertisements, and which ads are clicked on. This information allows the third party to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. TreeHugger.com does not have access to the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad-serving companies or ad networks. We will not share information that will specifically identify you to an ad-serving company or ad.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br><br><strong>Personal Information</strong><br><br>TreeHugger.com collects, integrates, and uses your personal information to help enhance and personalize your use of our Website and the services that we may offer. This information also allows us to provide you with targeted content, information, and advertising (on our Website, in newsletters, via e-mail, etc.). We also use anonymous and aggregated data to create statistics and reports for various business purposes. We may aggregate anonymous data and share it with our advertisers or TreeHugger.com partners in order to offer you potentially desirable products and services.<br></p><br>TreeHugger.com may also use your information to communicate via our newsletters, but only after you give your express permission for such communication. The exception is the case of "service e-mails," which we use to communicate with you regarding the system itself or your use of the system. Examples include: communication around system downtimes, announcements regarding the launch of new services, responses to customer service enquires, and messages regarding the completion of transactions you have initiated.<p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p><strong>Website Usage Information</strong><br><br>The website usage information we collect (e.g., cookies, Internet tags, web beacons, etc.) is used by TreeHugger.com to monitor the operation, technical functions, and quality of our Website and services.

This data is also used by TreeHugger.com to deliver customized content and advertising to you when your online behavior indicates that you are interested in a particular subject area. (i.e. you've communicated to us that you are particularly interested in recycling).</p><p></p>
