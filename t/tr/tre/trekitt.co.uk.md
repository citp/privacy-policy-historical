###  Security

We realise how important it is to securely store any information that you provide us. Our site (trekitt.co.uk) currently uses high-level Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, the most advanced security software currently available for online transactions. You can therefore rest assured that we take the security of your payment and personal details very seriously. We may vary this in the future if we feel you will benefit from greater security whilst using our website.

You can tell whether a webpage is secure as 'https' will replace the 'http' at the front of the www.trekitt.co.uk in your browser address window, also a small locked padlock will appear in the bottom bar of your browser window.

While we currently use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect your information off-line. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to our office. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. The servers on which we store your personal information are kept in a secure environment.

Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode

To give you even more confidence in shopping online with trekitt.co.uk we have introduced Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode. These services enhance your existing credit/debit card accounts against unauthorized use when you shop with us.

To use this service, you must first register with the bank or other organisation that issued your card.

Once you have registered and created your own private password with your card issuer, you will be automatically prompted at the checkout when the card is being processed to provide this password each time you make a purchase.

###  Phishing

Phishing is the practice of tricking someone into giving confidential information. Examples include falsely claiming to be a legitimate company when sending an email to a user, in an attempt to get the user to send private information that will be used for identity theft and fraud.  Trekitt will never ask you to send any personal details via email. If we require such details, for security reasons we will ask you to contact us by telephone. Should you receive an email claiming to be from Trekitt or Trek Kit (Hereford) Ltd requesting this kind of information please do not respond but contact us immediately.

### Cookies

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally. 

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example: 

\- enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task  
\- recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested  
\- measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast 

You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them.
