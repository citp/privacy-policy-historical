<p class="header"><u>Information Collected Through Third Parties</u></p>
<p><strong>Supplemental Information.</strong> We may from time to time supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information. We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected Through Technology.</strong>  In addition to any personal information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our  Hydroxatone Applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information ("Usage Information"). We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our  Hydroxatone Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for your computer or other device used to access the Hydroxatone Applications (any, a "Device"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the  Hydroxatone Applications, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our  Hydroxatone Applications and the website you visit after you leave our  Hydroxatone Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser. We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the  Hydroxatone Applications.</p>
<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Sites by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers. For example, when you visit the Hydroxatone Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Sites. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with the Hydroxatone Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with the Hydroxatone Applications.</p>
<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. "Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases session cookies once you exit your browser. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided.</p>
<p>Flash cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store Usage Information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>. If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly. If you click on ads that appear on our Hydroxatone Applications, our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your Device. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers; each advertiser's use of cookies is covered by that advertiser's own privacy policy.</p>
<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions, and may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open or click a link in an email message from us. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.</p>
<p>We may use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iphone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device).  HTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across websites but are not stored in browers' cookie files.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>
<p>We sometimes use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the  Hydroxatone Applications, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the  Hydroxatone Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to personal information. For example, we use information we collect about  Hydroxatone Application users to optimize our services and understand traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your personal information, we will treat it as personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Analytics Technologies.</strong> We use third parties' analytic and other tools to better understand who is using the Hydroxatone Applications, how people are using the Hydroxatone Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the Hydroxatone Applications, and to help us serve more targeted content and advertising to you. Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the  Hydroxatone Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system and browser used and other web sites you may have visited. We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third parties to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices. If you would like more information regarding which third party companies we use to provide these services who may be serving cookies or other tracking tools on our Hydroxatone Applications or want to know more about what your choices are about not having this anonymous collected or used by these companies, please <a href="#analytics">click here</a>.</p>
