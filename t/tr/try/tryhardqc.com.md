When you log onto the Internet, your computer says to your Internet service, "Here I am; talk to me!

Your Internet service's computer responds by saying, "OK, for this session, you sit at #12. " Some providers assign you a permanent or "static " IP address, but most use temporary ones. This helps assure your privacy, because it's difficult - if not impossible - to collect personal information about you via a temporary address.
