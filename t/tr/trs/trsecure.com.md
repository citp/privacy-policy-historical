# Data Usage Policy

**How Does an Individual Opt Into TRC Healthcare Communications?**

An individual opts into receiving messages and information from TRC Healthcare when they purchase products or services and agree to our terms, or when contact and request information is submitted via a TRC website request form, market research study or complimentary resource registration process. You can easily opt out of or manage your [communication preferences](https://web.archive.org/manage-your-communication-preferences) for TRC emails.

 **What Personal Information Does TRC Healthcare Collect?**

The information TRC gathers from individuals' use of our website or web-based products and services helps us personalize and continually improve your TRC experience. Here are the types of information TRC gathers:

 **Information You Provide:** TRC receives and stores information you enter on our website and actions you take while visiting our website, as well as information from support and service calls or requests you submit. You can choose not to provide certain information, but this may limit many of our features or content offers available to you. TRC uses the information that you provide for responding to your requests, offering specific content that aligns to your interests and needs, and to communicate important information about your use of TRC products and services.

 **Automatic Information:** TRC receives and stores certain types of information when you interact with TRC websites, products, service teams and market surveys. In addition, like most websites, TRC uses "cookies", to interpret your needs by analyzing your web browser access and actions on TRC's product, web pages or advertisements.

 **E-mail Communications:** To help TRC make e-mails more useful and relevant, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from TRC. If you do not want to receive email from TRC, please adjust your communication preferences by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/manage-your-communication-preferences) or the link above.

 **What About Cookies?**

Cookies are unique identifiers that can be digitally transferred to your device to enable web systems to recognize your device and to provide a better user experience. TRC uses cookies on its websites and products. The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies; how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie; or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of many personalization and filtering features in TRC environments, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

 **Data Storage Duration**

When TRC receives your information under lawful basis, we will keep your information securely for a minimum of 25 years. You can request that we delete any part of your data by emailing [privacyofficer@trchealthcare.com](mailto:privacyofficer@trchealthcare.com).
