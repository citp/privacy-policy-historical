## Information Collected by Third-Parties and Your Ad Choices

Third parties may collect information about you through the Service, including through use of the technologies described above. We may not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' data collection practices and we do not assume any liability related to their collection or use. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Websites. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.

For instance, in addition to our own systems, we may use DoubleClick, Google, Google AdMob, PubMatic, 24/7 Connect and other third-party Ad Servers, analytics platforms and data management platforms to serve and display Advertisements, or to collect information about you and your use of the Service for other analytics purposes. They may use cookies, pixel trackers, web beacons or other internet or mobile technology to collect non-personal and/or anonymous information about your use of the Service (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) and precise geolocation and user device identification (if you have provided your consent for such collection) during and about your visits to this Service and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. In certain cases, you have options and choices about the collection and use of information by third parties on our Service:

  * For more information about these third-party Ad Networks and opting out of tracking, see: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.
  * For more information about interest-based advertising and opting out, see: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/>
  * For more information about disabling and controlling third-party cookies in your browser, see: <http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1>

Users of the Service may opt out of Google Analytics, customize the Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ad Preferences Manager and learn more about how Google serves ads by viewing its [Customer Ads Help Center](https://support.google.com/ads/?hl=en). If you do not wish to participate in Google Analytics, you may also download the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/)

**Do Not Track Browser Disclosure**  
Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.

We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the NAI "Consumer Opt-out" link and the DAA opt-out link above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. 

## Interacting with Other Users

The eLuminary.org service is designed to allow people to collaborate. As such during your interactions with other users when you are Logged-In may expose you to opportunities to exchange information that is both personally identifiable and possibly intended to initiate contact beyond the scope of the Service. You should use reasonable and prudent caution with what you disclose publicly and to individuals. 

First, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit publicly might be read, collected, or used by other users of the service, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages, mine your data, communicate with or market to you in other ways. We are not responsible for personally identifiable information you choose to disclose publicly and the Company has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your activities or any of your submissions that are a result of your public activities. For more information, see the eLuminary.org [Service Agreement](http://www.miningco.com/en/c/Terms). 

Second, the Service features content provided by independent users that are not vetted by the Company nor are they employed by the Company. If you contact another user, or another user contacts you, directly or indirectly via explicit or inferred information exposed by your use of the Service or other services, then that communication is independent of the Service, and thus not subject to this Privacy Policy. The Company is not responsible for what users may say, or how they may use information provided to them. 

**Other Privacy Considerations**  
We may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a transfer or all or part of our business or assets (e.g., a sale, merger, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization) or are taking steps in anticipation of such a transaction (e.g., participating in due diligence). 

**Information from Users Outside of the United States**  
If you are visiting the Service from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and stored in our servers in the U.S. By using our Service, you consent to our collection and use of your data as described in this privacy policy, and acknowledge that data protection laws in the U.S. may be different or less restrictive than in some other countries. 

**Your California Privacy Rights**  
Under the California "Shine The Light" law, California residents may opt-out of the disclosure of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes (as those concepts are defined in that law). However, we do not currently engage in the type of sharing covered by that law. 

**Compliance With Legal Process**  
We may disclose personal information (1) if we believe such sharing is appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process; (2) to protect and defend our rights, services or property; (3) to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Service; or (4) to protect the safety or property of our users or any member of the public (among other things, this means that if we believe you have provided false information or attempted to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).
