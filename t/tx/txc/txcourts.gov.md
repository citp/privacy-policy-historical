These e-mail addresses are not linked to any other personally identifiable information; are not used for any purpose other than management of CaseMail accounts; are not reported or used in any manner that would reveal personally identifiable information; and are not released to any outside parties unless required by law. Registrants who need to change the e-mail address used for CaseMail can log in at [https://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/_mem_bin/FormsLogin.asp?/members/UserEdit.asp](http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/_mem_bin/FormsLogin.asp?/members/UserEdit.asp) and follow the instructions.
