**Our Policy**  
Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, TXU does not collect personally identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. We only collect personal information for specific purposes such as responding to requests for information or to provide services. We will not sell or provide your information to unaffiliated companies for commercial purposes unrelated to the business of TXU. In some instances, we may use this information to inform you of goods and services that may be of interest to you. Except as provided herein, TXU will not disclose any information about you to unaffiliated companies or organizations without your consent, unless: 

  * required by law; 
  * we believe it necessary to respond to an inquiry or provide you with a service which you have requested; 
  * to implement our terms of service; 
  * to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another TXU user, any member of the public or TXU.   




TXU and its affiliates recognize the trust you place in us when you give us personal information. In order to operate the Website or deliver a service we may sometimes share your personal information with a service partner under strict conditions. We will not otherwise disclose your personal information to other companies without your explicit consent. 

You are not required to register or provide information to us in order to view much of our site. To obtain services from TXU or subscribe to certain portions of our Website, such as, but not limited to, TXU's "Small Business Portal" or other services provided by TXU, you may be asked for personal information. We use your information to personalize your Web experience or to provide the services you requested. TXU will only use your information strictly in accordance with this Policy.

Your information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. We require our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by TXU.

TXU will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorized access to your personal information. 

TXU may use overseas facilities to process or back-up information. As a result, we transfer and store your personal information in our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your privacy.
