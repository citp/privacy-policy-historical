**Our Policy**   
Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, TXU Energy does not collect personally identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. We only collect personal information for specific purposes such as responding to requests for information or to provide services. We will not sell or provide your information to unaffiliated companies for commercial purposes unrelated to the business of TXU Energy. In some instances, we may use this information to inform you of goods and services that may be of interest to you. Except as provided herein, TXU Energy will not disclose any information about you to unaffiliated companies or organizations without your consent, unless: 

  * required by law;
  * we believe it necessary to respond to an inquiry or provide you with a service which you have requested; 
  * to implement our terms of service;
  * to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another TXU Energy user, any member of the public or TXU Energy.



TXU Energy and its affiliates recognize the trust you place in us when you give us personal information. In order to operate the Web site or deliver a service we may sometimes share your personal information with a service partner under strict conditions.
