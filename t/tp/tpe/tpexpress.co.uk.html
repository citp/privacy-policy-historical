  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First/Keolis TransPennine Limited ("First TransPennine Express")
is committed to preserving the privacy of all visitors to<a href="/" target="_self"></a>&nbsp;and to
protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In
particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat
information about you that we may receive from this website
("Site") and how we carry out data processing practices through the
use of the Internet and any other electronic communications
networks. Please read the following privacy policy to understand
how we use and protect the information that you provide to us or
how we may use and protect it in the future.</p>

<p>By registering for any services on this Site or by providing any
information to us, you consent to the collection, use and transfer
of your information under the terms of this policy.</p>

<h2>Information That We Collect From You</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In general, you can visit this Site without telling us who you
are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web server
collects the IP address. In addition, there are parts of this Site
where personal information may need to be collected from you for a
specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information
you request, or where requested to register you to, for example,
our Journey Check Alerts Service, or to enable you to use our
online ticket purchasing service. This is done through the use of
online forms and every time you email us or provide us with your
details in other ways (i.e. over the telephone, by fax, by mail
etc.).The information collected from you may include but is not
limited to:</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>your name, address, landline or mobile telephone numbers, fax
number and e-mail address;</li>

<li>company name and contact details;</li>

<li>your date of birth;</li>

<li>credit or debit card information;</li>

<li>booking reference details;</li>

<li>details of the ways in which you are happy to receive
information from us and/or selected third parties;&nbsp;</li>

<li>information collected to use the on-line ticket booking service
such as details of your departure point and destination.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>First TransPennine Express may:</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>offer contests and other promotional activities that may
require online registration. Persons wishing to participate in
those activities will be asked to provide certain personal
information. Some of the information requested for this purpose is
optional, but other information, such as email address, is
mandatory because it will be needed to notify and identify
winners;</li>

<li>require the selection of a user ID and password for the use of
some of its services or activities;</li>

<li>offer you the opportunity to receive email updates and
announcements concerning our services and special promotions.
Personal information you have provided to us may be used to
facilitate those communications;</li>

<li>collect information about you from e-mails, letters, telephone
calls, customer satisfaction forms or from any other communications
you send to or have with us; and</li>

<li>collect additional information automatically about your visit
to our Site.</li>
</ul>

<p>First TransPennine Express encourages visitors to its Site to
contact us with questions and comments. Email addresses and other
information in relation to persons doing so may also be collected
in order to facilitate our responses to those
inquiries.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 You will find that it is not compulsory to provide us with any
additional information we request which is not necessary or
reasonable in order to provide you with the services you have
requested. Furthermore, please note that our policy is not to ask
for sensitive personal data - that is, data relating to: race or
ethnic origin; political opinion; religious or other similar
beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; sexual
orientation; criminal records. We recommend that you do not provide
such information to us. If you choose to do so for any reason, this
will mean that you have given (and we accept) your explicit consent
for us to use that information for the reasons described in this
policy, or as explained at the time you provide the
information.</p>

<h2>Use of Information Collected</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>IP address information that we collect is not used to personally
identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of
visits, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, etc. We use
this information to measure the use of our Site and to improve its
content.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 When other personal information, such as your name and e-mail
address, is collected from you with your consent (for example,
through the use of on-line forms or via e-mail etc.) we generally
let you know at the time of collection how we will use that
personal information. We may also use the personal information you
provide or which we collect via this Site for the purposes of:</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>providing any goods or services that you have requested from us
(including registering for our Journey Check Alerts service or
subscribing to receive information);</li>

<li>billing you and contacting you where necessary concerning your
orders (such as for ticket booking services);</li>

<li>responding to your inquiries or to process your requests in

TransPennine Limited; or</li>

<li>which are offered jointly with or on behalf of other
organizations.</li>
</ul>

please let us know.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

information for the purposes described above.</p>

<h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cookies are small amounts of information which we may store on
your computer to enable our server to collect certain information
from your web browser. Cookies in themselves do not identify the
individual user, just the computer used. Cookies and other similar
technology make it easier for you to log on to and use the Site
during future visits. It also allows us to monitor website traffic,
to identify you when you visit this Site, to personalise the
content of the Site for you and to enable you to both carry out
transactions and have access to information about your account.
Cookies themselves only record which areas of the site have been
visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Allowing us
to create a cookie does not give us access to the rest of your
computer and we will not use cookies to track your online activity
once you leave our site. Cookies are read only by the server that
placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. With most
Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard
drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is
stored. If you want to know how to do this please look at the help
menu on your web browser. However, please note that switching off
cookies will mean that you may not be able to use certain features
on our Site. Find out more about the use of cookies and on how to
switch off cookies on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com/" target="_blank">www.cookiecentral.com</a>&nbsp;or<a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/controlcookies.asp" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org/controlcookies.asp</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Disclosures</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The information you provide to us will be held on our server in
the United Kingdom and may be accessed by or given to our staff and
to third parties including our group companies and business
partners (such as our web agency, database management company and,
government bodies and law enforcement agencies, successors in title
to our business and suppliers we engage to process data on our
behalf, who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy or
for other purposes approved by you. Those parties process
information, fulfil and deliver orders, process credit card
payments and provide support and other services on our behalf. We
may also:</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>disclose personal information you have provided through our
Site to persons or companies that we retain to carry out promotions
and other activities for which you have registered or in which you
have otherwise asked to participate;</li>

<li>pass aggregate information on the usage of our Site (e.g. we
might disclose the median ages of visitors to our Site, or the
numbers of visitors to our Site that come from different geographic
areas) to third parties but this will not include information that
can be used to identify you personally;</li>

<li>allow carefully selected third parties, including other
companies in our group, to contact you occasionally about products
and services which may be of interest to you (where you have
consented to us doing so). They may contact you by post, telephone
or fax, as well as by e-mail. If you change your mind about being
contacted by these companies in the future, please let us or them
know.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, if our business enters into a joint venture with or is
sold to or merged with another business entity, your information
may be disclosed to our new business partners or
owners.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have
strong data protection laws. However, we will always take steps to
ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance
with this policy.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 Unless required to do so by law, we will not otherwise share, sell
or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your
consent.</p>

<h2>Users 16 and Under</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent or
guardian's permission before you provide any personal information
to us. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us
with personal information.</p>

<h2>Other Websites</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Site may contain links to other websites which are outside
our control and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. If you
access other websites using the links provided, the operators of
these websites may collect information from you which will be used
by them in accordance with their privacy policy, which may differ
from ours.</p>

<h2>Data Retention, Security of Information Collected, Internet
Based Transfers and Disclaimer</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will retain your information for a reasonable period or as
long as the law requires. In accordance with the UK's Data

administrative security measures to protect your information from
access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing,
accidental loss, destruction and damage both on-line and

protect against viruses and other harmful components, the nature of

this Site, its servers or emails which may be sent by us are free
of viruses or other harmful components.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

local advertising or other laws in relation to this Site or its
contents.</p>

personal information we hold about you and you may ask us to make

date . If you wish to correct or update the personal information
that you have provided to us of if you choose to opt out of any

entitled by law to charge a small administrative fee to meet our
costs in providing you with details of the information we hold
about you and we may require proof of your identity before we
supply the information to you.</p>

privacy policy, please contact us [using the details provided on
