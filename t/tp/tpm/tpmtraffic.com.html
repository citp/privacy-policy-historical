                by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available 
                to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting 
                you or sending you e-mails based on your requesting information.</p>
                <p><strong>Choice Opt-in</strong></p> 
                <p>Our members and their subscribers are given the opportunity to 
                'opt-in' to having their information used for purposes not directly 
                related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.</p>
                <p>Users of our site will always be notified if their information 
                is being collected by any outside parties. We do this to ensure 
                that our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not 
                they should proceed with services that require an outside party.</p>
                <p><strong>Information Tracked</strong></p> 
                <p>At times we will use your IP address to help diagnose problems 
                with our server and to administer our web site. We also may track 
                browser types to help us understand our visitors' needs related 
                to our web site design.</p>
                <p>There is an optional section of our web site where input forms 
                require your name, company, and e-mail address. This form provides 
                the ability to opt-in to receiving future emails of any sort from 
                <b>Target Point Media</b>. If you opt-in to receiving email communications 
                from us, then we may send information to you on our products or 
                services.</p>
                <p>You may review and change your information with us at any time 
                by clicking on the <b>"modify profile"</b> link or similar 
                found at the bottom of emails sent via our system, or by contacting 
                us at <a href="mailto:info@targetpointmedia.com">privacy@targetpointmedia.com</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong></p> 
                <p>In order to determine a user’s ability to receive HTML email in 
                addition to whether or not an email has been opened, <b>Target Point 
                Media</b> includes a “web beacon” in a majority of the HTML email 
                messages we send. A web beacon (actually a small .gif image) is 
                activated when an HTML email is opened via a request for the image 
                on our servers.</p>
                <p>This capability helps <b>Target Point Media</b> send email in a format 
                users can read and enables <b>Target Point Media</b>, and our clients 
                that use the functionality, to track the aggregate number of emails 
                opened. The web beacon does not collect any personally identifiable 
                information. Users that do not want to receive email messages 
                with web beacons can choose to receive their emails in text (non-HTML) 
                format.</p>
                <p>We also use, and provide our clients with, the capability to track 
                when a URL has been clicked inside of an email message sent by 
                our system. We use this functionality to track which links were 
                clicked and in what quantity, as well as the aggregate number 
                of links clicked. This click tracking functionality does not collect 
                any personally identifiable information.</p>
                  <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> 
               <p>Client-side cookies are used to verify the login status of customers 
                using products or services linked directly with our website. Usage 
                of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable 
                information while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they 
                may still use our site; however, the user may not be able to access 
                all areas of our site.</p>
                 <p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p> 
                <p>Any new policy will be posted on our site at least one week prior 
                to its taking effect. If at any point we decide to use personally 
                identifiable information in a manner different from that stated 
                at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an 
                email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
                information in this different manner.</p>
                   <p><strong>Safe Harbor Data Privacy Notice</strong></p> 
                <p><b>Target Point Media</b> adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles published 
                by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the "Safe Harbor Principles") 
                with respect to personal information (as defined below) it receives 
                from the European Union. This notice outlines our general policy 
                and practices for implementing the Safe Harbor Principles, including 
                the type of information to which this notice applies, how we use 
                personal information, and the choices individuals have regarding 
                our use of, and their ability to correct, that personal information. 
                If there is any conflict between the policies in this notice and 
                the Safe Harbor Principles, the Safe Harbor Principles will govern.</p>
                <p>This notice applies to all personal information we handle, including 
                on-line (except as noted below), off-line, and manually processed 
                data. For purposes of this notice, "personal information" 
                means data that; is transferred from the European Union to the 
                United States; is recorded in any form; and is about, or pertains 
                to, a specific individual who is identified in, or is identifiable 
                from, the data.</p>
                <p>"Sensitive information" is a subcategory of personal 
                information. Sensitive information is defined as personal information 
                specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, 
                political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade 
                union membership, or the sex life of the individual. Sensitive 
                information also includes personal information received from a 
                third party where the third party treats and identifies it as 
                sensitive.</p>
                  <p><strong>Disclosures and Transfers </strong></p> 
                <p>We do not disclose personal information to third parties, except 
                when one or more of the following conditions is true:</p>
                <ul><li>We have the individual's permission to make the disclosure;</li>
                <li>The disclosure is permitted by law or mandatory professional standards;</li>
                <li>The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition 
                of all or part of our business or assets;</li>
                <li>The personal information to be disclosed is publicly available;</li>
                The party to whom the disclosure is made controls, is controlled 
                by, or is under common control with Target Point Media;
                The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or 
                maintenance of legal claims; or
                <li>The disclosure is to persons or entities for whom we are providing 
                services, provided the disclosure is consistent with the purpose 
                for which the personal information was obtained.</li></ul>
                <p>We will comply with the Safe Harbor Principles with respect to 
                disclosures of sensitive information, including, when applicable, 
                obtaining the explicit consent of the individual prior to disclosing 
                sensitive information to a third party or using sensitive information 
                for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected 
                or subsequently authorized by the individual. Transfers of information 
                permitted under this notice, either to third parties or within 
                Target Point Media, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction 
                to another, such as transfers to and from the United States of 
                America.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Security, Integrity, and Access</strong></p>
                 <p>We employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures, including 
                education and training of our personnel, designed to provide the 
                personal information in our possession with reasonable protection 
                from accidental loss or destruction, improper use, alteration, 
                or disclosure. Personal information collected or displayed through 
                a Web site is protected in transit by industry standard encryption 
                processes. However, we cannot guarantee the security of personal 
                information accessible on or transmitted via the Internet.</p>
                <p>We process personal information in ways compatible with the purpose 
                for which the personal information was collected, or as otherwise 
                authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for such 
                purposes, we take reasonable steps to make sure that personal 
                information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable 
                with regard to its intended use.</p>
                <p>If an individual becomes aware that personal information we maintain 
                about that individual is inaccurate, or if an individual would 
                like to update or review his or her personal information, the 
                individual may contact us using the contact information below. 
                As a security precaution, we may request that the individual provide 
                identifying information such as name, address, birth date, and/or 
                social security number. In addition, we may limit or deny access 
                to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably 
                burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise 
                permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement. In some circumstances, 
                we may charge a reasonable fee, where warranted, for access to 
                personal information.</p>
                  <p><strong>Accountability and Enforcement</strong></p> 
                <p>We established a program to monitor our adherence to the Safe 
                Harbor Principles and to address questions and concerns regarding 
                our adherence. This program will include a statement, at least 
                once a year, signed by our authorized representative, verifying 
                our adherence to the Safe Harbor Principles. We encourage interested 
                persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information 
                below.</p>
                 <p>With respect to any dispute relating to this notice that cannot 
                be resolved through our internal processes, we will cooperate 
                with competent European Union data protection authorities and 
                comply with the advice of such authorities. In the event that 
                we or such authorities determine that we did not comply with this 
                notice, we will take appropriate steps to address any adverse 
                effects and to promote future compliance.</p>
                 <p><strong>Amendment</strong></p> 
                <p>We may amend this notice from time to time by posting a revised 
                notice on this Web site, or a similar Web site that replaces this 
                Web site. If we amend the notice, the new notice will apply to 
                personal information previously collected only insofar as the 
                rights of the individual affected are not reduced. So long as 
                we profess to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles, we will not 
                amend this notice in a manner inconsistent with the Safe Harbor 
                Principles.</p>
                 <p><strong>Information Subject to Other Policies</strong></p> 
                
            <p>We are committed to following the Safe Harbor Principles for all 
              personal information, as that term is defined herein. Other information 
              we receive may be subject to policies that may differ in some respects 
              from the policies set forth in this notice. Certain of our Web sites

              Web sites. Those policies may be accessed through the Web sites
