by using cookies, tracking pixels and other technologies (collectively, “Tools”). We may use
this information to better understand, customize and improve the user experience of our
websites, services and offerings. For example, we may use web analytics services such as
Google Analytics that leverage Tools to help us understand how visitors engage with and
navigate our Site. Information on how Google Analytics collects and processes your data is

Your web browser can be set to allow you to control whether you will accept cookies, reject
cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is sent to you. If your browser is set to reject
cookies, the Site may not recognize you when you return to the website, and some website
functionality may be lost. The Help section of your browser may tell you how to prevent your
browser from accepting cookies. To find out more about cookies, including how to see what
cookies have been set and how to manage or delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.
How We Use the Information We Collect
If you choose to provide information to us, for example by email, the information is used for
the purpose you provided it to us. For example, if you provide your contact information in an
inquiry to us, we will use your contact information to process and respond to that inquiry and
any related activity that may result from your inquiry.
How We Share the Information We Collect
We may share your personal information with TPG Global, LLC and its affiliates for the
purposes described in this Policy.
We may share personal information with service providers that perform services on our
behalf such as payment service providers, analytics providers, and hosting providers. In
accordance with applicable law, we have entered into legally binding agreements requiring


them to use or disclose personal information only as necessary to perform services on our
behalf or comply with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, we may disclose personal information about you (a) if we are required or
permitted to do so by law or legal process, for example due to a court order or a request from
a law enforcement agency, (b) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to
prevent physical harm or financial loss, (c) in connection with an investigation of suspected
or actual fraudulent or other illegal activity, and (d) in conjunction with (i) the making,
management, or disposition of any of our investments, or (ii) business continuity.
Links to Third-Party Websites
The Site may contain links to other web sites. We have no control over and are not
responsible for the privacy policies or practices of such sites. Whenever you link to another
web site, you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note that any
information that you provide is going to a third party, and therefore you should familiarize
yourself with that party’s privacy policy.
Data Transfers
The Site is controlled and operated from the United States and is not intended to be subject to
the laws or jurisdiction of any country or territory other than that of the United States.
Information Security
We maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to protect your
personal information against loss or accidental, unlawful or unauthorised, alteration, access,
disclosure or use. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to
be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer
secure, please notify us immediately.
Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When
a user turns on DNT, the browser sends a message to websites requesting that they do not
track the user. TPG does not change its practices, described elsewhere in this privacy policy,
in response to DNT browser settings or signals. For information about DNT, visit
www.allaboutdnt.org.
Third parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and
across different websites, including your use of this Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply
to, and we are not responsible for, the practices of third parties that collect your personal
information.
How Long We Keep Information
The time period for which we keep personal information depends on the purposes for which
we collected it. In all cases we keep it for as long as necessary to fulfil those purposes. We
will then delete this personal information unless we are required to preserve your personal


data in connection with litigation, investigations and proceedings, or if a longer retention
period is required or permitted by applicable law.

construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, as further provided in the
Terms of Use.
