# Tixr | Privacy policy | Love Your Ticket

At Tixr, we want you to **love** your ticket.

To make sure this happens, we use technology to learn what you like and want. While we think our sites, apps, and point-of-sale systems are pretty cool, we also understand that you need to protect your privacy. We take that seriously.

Here's an overview of what we do. If it's not right for you, you don't have to use our services. If you go ahead and use them (and we hope you do), then you are agreeing to the policy we've set here and in our site's [terms of service](https://web.archive.org/termsofservice).

If you have any questions, give us a shout at [support@tixr.com](mailto:support@tixr.com)
