###  What this privacy policy covers 

This policy covers how Videology, acting as data controller, treats information that Videology collects and receives through our services, which include Videology’s digital media and ad targeting solutions and any other technology, products and/or services offered by Videology (collectively referred to as the “Services”), including your past use of the Services. For more information about our Products and Services, please [click here](http://www.videologygroup.com/products/). 

This policy does not apply to information about you collected by third party advertisers and publishers who use Videology’s Services, or other third parties linked to or otherwise accessible via the Services. The information collected or received by any such providers and third parties is subject to their own privacy policies. 

###  Collection and Use of Information 

####  Personal Information 

Videology does not require you to provide personal information in order to use many of the Services. However, in case you decide not to provide requested personal information to Videology, you may not be able to use all of our services. Personal information is information  relating to you, such as name, street address and email address collected by Videology or otherwise received by Videology. On some of Videology’s web pages, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as when submitting a request for a media kit or requesting that Videology contact you. Additionally, if you enter into a business relationship with Videology, we may require that you provide us with personal information for administrative purposes, such as maintaining account information, preparing invoices and issuing payment. If you do provide us with personal information, your information shall only be used for the purpose for which it is submitted. 

####  IP Address 

Videology receives IP addresses from most users who view ads we deliver because, in most cases, this information is automatically sent to us by the internet browser software (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla FireFox and Google Chrome) of those users each time we receive an ad request from our web site partners to deliver an ad to a site on which the users are viewing content. We use IP address to assist us to both deliver the ad and to select the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address, such as ISP provider. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses, such as the number of ad impressions delivered to a geographic region, may also be reported to our advertising clients. Finally, we may use IP address to help identify and combat potentially fraudulent activity. 

####  Anonymous Information 

When you visit a web site or view content on other Internet-enabled devices (e.g., smart/connected TV, gaming consoles, set-top boxes) that use our Services and view an advertisement that we’ve sent to that site or device, Videology may use cookies and other technologies (such as pixels or web beacons, if supported by the device) to record and store anonymous information about your interaction with the Services, most commonly known as “click-stream data”. Click-stream data is associated with your device’s Internet browser/content delivery software (e.g., Microsoft Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or a smart/connected TV or gaming console's browser) and can include information such as device type (e.g., computer, tablet, smart/connected TV), date/time of visit, browser type, web pages visited when viewing an ad we’ve sent in response to a request from one of our web site partners, and information on your interaction with the Services when viewing content on your device’s Internet browser, including whether you interacted with the advertisement (e.g., viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what content you viewed (i.e., which advertisement we delivered to you). For more detailed information on cookies and web beacons, please see our [FAQs](http://www.videologygroup.com/faqs). 

In order to optimize the effectiveness of the Services for our clients, we use cookies and our servers to store anonymous behavioral and demographic data we receive from third party data providers, publishers and other partners we work with. This data may include such things as zip code, age, gender and income range, but cannot be tied to an individual and is stored in an encrypted format within our cookies and/or on our servers (e.g., random numbers, letters and symbols). To learn more about third party data providers we work with, please [click here](http://www.videologygroup.com/third-party-data-partners/). 

####  Use and Disclosure 

Videology uses non-personal information it receives and collects to customize, target, and measure the effectiveness of the advertisements we deliver to you via the Service (including targeted advertising based on demographic characteristics, viewing preferences and behaviors), to prevent showing you the same ads repeatedly, for reporting on campaign delivery to both advertisers and digital media inventory partners, for general reporting purposes (such as the total number of ads delivered by Videology in a given month), and to predict the characteristics and preferences of the audience on sites that use our video advertising Services in order to assist (a) advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant Internet audience, and (b) digital media inventory providers (such as web site owners) to better understand the make-up (types of users) who visit their site(s) so they can more effectively assist advertisers in finding the desired audience for their ad campaign(s). 

Videology uses personal information you provide to us to communicate with and respond to your inquiries, to conduct research about use of the Services; to fulfill your requests for products and services; to help offer you other products, services or offerings that may be of interest to you; and to provide anonymous internal and external reporting. If you choose to provide us with personal information including your email address, we will not use your email address to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in and then to opt-out in the event you change your mind. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of important changes to the Services or for customer service purposes). 

Videology will not rent, sell or share information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except to provide the Services, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  * We will provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Videology under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Videology fulfill a transaction you requested or communicate with you about offers from Videology and our marketing partners. However, unless you have granted permission, these companies do not have any independent right to share or use this information for other purposes.
  * We work with third party vendors, partners, advertisers, publishers, demographic and behavioral data providers and other service and content providers. In order to optimize the Services and to better target advertisements, we may share information about you with them, including statistical and demographic data about our users and their use of the Services. We will not authorize these third party providers to share or use your information other than as necessary to provide the Services and to enhance user experience through targeting of ads.
  * If Videology, or part(s) of Videology, is acquired or merged with another company we will transfer information about you to the acquiring company.
  * Finally, Videology may share information on individuals it deems necessary to comply with a subpoena or court order, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials.
