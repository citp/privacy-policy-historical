We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. IP addresses are also logged within the message boards.  These do not identify any specific person, but help us in maintaining site and board security.  This information is not disseminated in any way other than at a macro level (i.e. we received 100000 page views from 1000 different IP addresses) to any outside source.

We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad server, and we do not have access to this information.

**Registration Forms**

Our site message board registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name, email, and postal address), unique identifiers (username and password), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level).

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like email address).  We gather various demographic information that we may make available to advertisers at a macro level (i.e. we have 5000 users who live in Alabama and are ages 35-45).

Users may opt-out of receiving any mailings from the site; see the choice/opt-out section below.
