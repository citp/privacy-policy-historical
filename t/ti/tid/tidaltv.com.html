Click-stream data can include information such as IP address, date/time of visit, browser type, web pages visited and information on your interaction with the Services, including whether you interacted with the advertisement (e.g., viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what content you viewed.  We may also use shared objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash cookies”) to store click-stream data and, in some instances, we may also use web beacons (also referred to as “pixels” or “gifs”) in connection with cookies and shared objects, in each case, to assist in providing you with more relevant, meaningful advertising experience.
