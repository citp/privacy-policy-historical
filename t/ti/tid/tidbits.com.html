<h2>TidBITS Privacy Statement</h2>

<p>TidBITS Electronic Publishing takes online privacy very seriously. We actively protect the privacy of users of TidBITS Web sites and people who subscribe to TidBITS publications and mailing lists.</p>



<p><strong>Subscription Lists &amp; Email Addresses</strong> -- TidBITS holds the names and email addresses of subscribers in the strictest confidence, and will not disclose specific subscriber information under any circumstances unless required by law. TidBITS subscriber databases and subscription lists can be accessed  by only a few members of the TidBITS staff and are well protected against theft, tampering, and misuse (electronic or otherwise).</p>

<p>Aggregate information about TidBITS subscriptions lists (such as the total number of subscribers) may be discussed in TidBITS publications, used to promote TidBITS, or disclosed to sponsors or advertisers.</p> 

<p>To receive a TidBITS publication or mailing list via email, you must give us  your email address - without it, we can't send you anything. Although we don't require subscribers to tell us their names, your email program or provider may include your name with your subscription request. If so, we'll record your name with your email address; the information helps ensure we don't confuse you with  anyone else when sorting out subscription problems.</p>

<p>If you want to read TidBITS publications without subscribing via email, consider using a Web browser's "subscription" or page monitoring feature to be notified of new issues on the Web. You can contact &lt;<a href="mailto:editors@tidbits.com">editors@tidbits.com</a>&gt; to find out what page(s) to monitor. TidBITS may also provide specific Web-based distribution options you can use.</p>


<p><strong><a name="Contributions">Contributions to TidBITS</a></strong> -- If you participate in our <a href="/about/support/contributors.html">voluntary contribution program</a>, TidBITS receives and records information related to your contribution, including your name, email address, postal address, and contribution amount, but <em>not</em> your credit card number. As with our subscriber databases and subscription lists, this information is held in the strictest confidence. The information can be accessed by only a few members of the TidBITS staff and is well protected against theft, tampering, and misuse (electronic or otherwise).
</p>

<p>If you have chosen to list your name and a URL to a Web page of your choice, that information appears on our TidBITS Contributors page, which is available to the public. Also appearing on that page is aggregate information about the number of contributors.
</p>

<p>If you asked us to remind you to renew in a year, we will send you an email reminder at that time. We may also send you email to aid in resolving problems relating to a contribution or to communicate with you about other issues related specifically to contributors. 
</p>

<p>Contribution processing is handled for TidBITS by Kagi. To process your payment, Kagi collects information including your name, postal address, email address, and credit card number. Use of that information is governed by their <a href="http://www.kagi.com/privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. Kagi offers both <a href="https://order.kagi.com/?2WL">secure</a> and <a href="http://order.kagi.com/?2WL">insecure</a> Web payment forms, and you can also download a <a href="http://www.tidbits.com/about/support/tidbits-register.hqx">Kagi Register application</a> that enables you to send in a payment via fax or postal mail if you're uncomfortable giving your credit card number via the Web.</p>

<p><strong>Purchases of TidBITS Tchotchkes</strong> -- Orders for TidBITS merchandise are handled for us by CafePress.com. To process your order, CafePress.com collects information including your name, postal address, and credit card number. Use of that information is governed by their <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/help/privacy.aspx">privacy statement</a>.</p>

<p>We can query CafePress.com's Web site and see information about orders, including your name, the date you placed the order, and the specific products you ordered. We hold this information in the strictest confidence. The information can be accessed by only a few members of the TidBITS staff, although we have no control over the security precautions on the CafePress.com site.
</p>

<p><strong>Web Server Usage</strong> -- TidBITS records information about how people access our Web sites. This information includes your IP address (or the DNS name associated with it) and what Web software you're using. Unless your IP address or its DNS name identifies you specifically, there's no way to use this connection information to identify a particular user. No TidBITS sites currently use HTTP cookies in any fashion, although we do use HTTP redirection to better monitor usage and interest in specific items.</p>

<p>We may record information about queries submitted to TidBITS search facilities to better understand how people use our search features. As with other Web accesses, this information generally cannot be associated with any particular user; in any case, query information is not disclosed to anyone outside the TidBITS staff.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tidbits.com/about/stats.html">Aggregate information</a> about the usage of TidBITS's main Web server is currently available to the public.
</p>

 

<p><strong>Editorial Mail</strong> -- Email messages sent to TidBITS editorial addresses are considered public statements and become the property of TidBITS Electronic Publishing. Unless noted otherwise in the message itself, TidBITS may publish such messages (including the author's name and email address) in whole or in part on TidBITS Web sites and/or in TidBITS publications. TidBITS will generally try to contact correspondents before any such publication, but makes no guarantee to do so. TidBITS will honor any request not to publish a message, or not to publish the correspondent's name or email address.
</p>



<p><strong>Discussion Lists &amp; Archives</strong> -- TidBITS maintains email discussion lists. Although subscriber information is maintained in the strictest confidence (see above), participating in discussion lists will reveal information about yourself such as your email address and (possibly) your name to all subscribers. This information could be collected by a third party. Additionally, users should consider any discussion list a public forum, and exercise caution in disclosing any personal information.</p>

<p>Web-based archives of discussion lists maintained by TidBITS will also include information disclosed by discussion participants; however, we go to some effort to ensure information such as email addresses can't easily be harvested by automated programs.
</p>


<p><strong>Surveys</strong> -- TidBITS may ask readers and/or Web site users to participate in surveys. In all cases, participation will be voluntary. If a survey asks for personal information, answering those questions will be optional.
</p>



<p><strong>Translations and Mirror Sites</strong> -- TidBITS publications are <a href="http://www.tidbits.com/about/translations.html">translated</a> into a variety of languages, and those translations are hosted by several mirror sites.</p><p>

</p><p>TidBITS can't control the privacy policies of mirror sites, and it's possible they differ significantly from ours. If you're concerned, consider accessing TidBITS material directly from our servers, rather than from a mirror.
</p>

<p>Some TidBITS translations are available via both email and the Web. In the cases where email or Web distribution takes place via TidBITS servers, the privacy policies outlined above apply in full. However, we cannot vouch for the privacy policies of other organizations hosting translation mailing lists or Web sites. We encourage such sites to post their own privacy policies, or indicate they fully comply with the policies outlined here.</p>
 


<p><strong>External Links</strong> --  TidBITS's Web sites and publications contain numerous links to other network sites. TidBITS cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other organizations or the content of external Web sites.</p>
