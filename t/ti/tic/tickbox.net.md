This web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information we do everything in our power to protect user-information online and off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, an account handler or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected log-in screens to gain entry to restricted information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

**Supplementation of Information**

In order for this web site to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual’s preference, we combine information about the preferences and habits of users with similar information from our partners to create personalised user profiles. 

**Special Offers**

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify registration. Established members will occasionally receive information on special deals and promotions. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

**Site and Service Updates**

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their preferences.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your postcode), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavour to provide a way to correct or update that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done once logged in members can change their details through the "View/Edit my profile" option or by emailing our Customer Support ([support@tickbox.net](mailto:support@tickbox.net)). If a member wishes to be removed from our mailing list they can do so by emailing our Customer Support ([support@tickbox.net](mailto:support@tickbox.net)). 

**Choice/Opt-in**

Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-in’ to have their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, one of our surveys may have an ‘opt-in’ mechanism so users can receive relevant information or marketing materials from our partners. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional materials, or newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at [support@tickbox.net](mailto:support@tickbox.net)

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
