# Privacy Policy

This Policy explains what personal information Ticketmaster and its group (known in this Policy as **"we"** or **"Ticketmaster"** ) collect  both online (including through apps) and offline and how we use it. Please read it carefully.

Generally, we collect information about you if you create an account, from your purchase of tickets, when you email or call us, or from box office purchases operated or administered by us, and when you use our websites, apps and social media. We use that and other information to provide better services, marketing and support to you and our other customers (including by analysing your information to provide you with a personalised experience).

When you, for example, create an account, purchase tickets, download one of our apps or contact us on the phone, we may ask your consent to use your information for certain purposes. Your choices about how we use information are described here. 

As an authorised ticket agent, Ticketmaster sells tickets on behalf of third parties who provide or sponsor an event, or who operate a venue where we hold events. We refer to these artists, agents, venues, promoters or sponsors from whom we obtain tickets to sell to you as our **"Event Partners"**. We will share your information with our Event Partners and may share your information with other third parties, as further described here.

Ticketmaster is a data controller (i.e. a person responsible for the processing of your personal information) in respect of all of the information which Ticketmaster collects and receives about you when you use our services.

Ticketmaster is bound by, and uses your information in accordance with, the Belgian Act of 8 December 1992 on the protection of privacy in relation to the processing of personal data.

**Your payment and billing information.** We will hold payment and billing information you provide to us, e.g. credit card number and post code when you buy a ticket, in connection with the handling of your ticket orders. If you’ve asked us to, we may also store payment and billing information to make it easier for you to buy tickets in future.

**Information you post online.** For example, we hold information you post on our website or on a third-party social media site to which we have access (including reviews you post or surveys you complete).

We may also add information to your details which we have obtained from other companies or sources. For example, we may cross check the accuracy of the information we hold with other databases, or we may add demographic information.
