## Information Sharing and Disclosure

User Profile information including member's age and town are displayed to people in order to facilitate user interaction in the TICTACSEARCH.COM social networking community. We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you request, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with TICTACSEARCH.COM under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help TICTACSEARCH.COM communicate with you about offers from TICTACSEARCH.COM and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. We may sometimes share aggregate non-personal information with third parties such as the media, advertisers, and government agencies. This aggregate information is typically in the form of statistics, such as numbers of TICTACSEARCH.COM users who live in a particular state or fall within a particular age group. Such aggregate information is gathered from individual TICTACSEARCH.COM users’ information but is not traceable to any specific identifiable TICTACSEARCH.COM user. We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the TICTACSEARCH.COM terms of use, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. If TICTACSEARCH.COM is acquired by or merged with or into another company, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

## Our Advertisers

We do not share your personal information with our advertisers. However, the advertising we display is targeted to users of particular services and content. So if you view or click on a targeted ad, the advertiser (or other companies affiliated with the advertiser) may assume that you meet the targeting criteria – for example, women ages 50-60 from a particular geographic area or with children or grandchildren of a certain age. 

## Cookies and Web Beacons

TICTACSEARCH.COM, like many Web sites, uses cookies to prepare customized Web pages for you. A cookie is a file containing a string of code that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer, AOL, or Mozilla Firefox) to connect to TICTACSEARCH.COM, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables TICTACSEARCH.COM to present you with custom Web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you see a welcome page with your name on it and information that relates to where you live (your zip code) and products or services that reflect your interests.

In addition to TICTACSEARCH.COM’ cookies, when you visit TICTACSEARCH.COM your computer may receive cookies from our advertisers, and from other sites displayed as search results or links. The cookies inserted by those third parties are not covered by TICTACSEARCH.COM’ Privacy Policy, but rather, by the policies of those advertisers and outside Web sites.

You can set up your browser to reject cookies or tell you when a cookie has been sent. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of TICTACSEARCH.COM’ interactive features, and we hope you will leave them turned on.

TICTACSEARCH.COM also uses web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs) to access TICTACSEARCH.COM cookies inside and outside our Web pages and in connection with TICTACSEARCH.COM products and services. A web beacon is a transparent image placed on a web page that sends a signal when a person visits that page. This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the TICTACSEARCH.COM Web site. We may also use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to TICTACSEARCH.COM users, to let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened. No personal information is transmitted through web beacons.

This information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which products are most interesting, and what kinds of offers our visitors like to see. Although our third party marketing partners manage the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.
