## Information We Collect and Retain

We collect the [personal](https://web.archive.org/privacy/fullstatement.aspx#2 "personal") and [demographic](https://web.archive.org/privacy/fullstatement.aspx#3 "demographic") information you choose to provide us. We also collect information about how you use our sites and the areas of our site that you visit. We may also acquire information about you from third parties in order to further personalize your experience. The resulting logs contain information necessary for analyzing the use of resources, troubleshooting problems, and improving services. We also use [cookies](https://web.archive.org/privacy/fullstatement.aspx#4 "cookies") and [web beacons](https://web.archive.org/privacy/fullstatement.aspx#5 "web beacons").

## How Information is Used

Information you post in public areas of the site or placed in the searchable Resume database will be accessed, used, and stored by others around the world. We strive to provide a safe, secure environment by attempting to limit access to our database to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that unauthorized parties will not gain access. We also cannot control how authorized users store or transfer information downloaded from the database, so you should ensure that you do not post sensitive information to Monster.

We use the information we collect about you to deliver the products and services we offer, and to operate and improve our sites. Our services include the display of personalized content and advertising on our site or other sites with which we have a business relationship. We may use your information to contact you about Monster site updates, conduct surveys, or informational and service-related communications, including important security updates.

## Disclosure of Information to Others

We share your information with third parties who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These third parties may not use that information for any purpose other than assisting us in providing those products and services. 

If you have consented for us to do so, we may use your information to contact you about other products or services available from our affiliates. 

If you have consented for us to do so, we may also share your information with third parties who may contact you about their products or services. 

We also share information where legally required. Information collected on our Sites is stored in whole or in part in the United States, and may be subject to U.S. law. 

We may disclose and transfer information if our business is sold or acquired.

You may review, correct, or delete the personal information you submit to us at any time. Simply [log into your account](https://web.archive.org/Login.aspx "log into your account"), go to your account profile, and make the necessary changes. We will delete your personal information, but will retain logs, demographic and statistical information about you and keep an archival copy of your information in an anonymized form. If your personal information was previously accessed by others using the Sites, we are unable to delete the information from their systems. 

Monster has no control over the information that Ad Networks or other third parties may have about you. We encourage you to visit their web sites and review and read the privacy policies and opt-out practices that govern their usage. 

If you change your mind about receiving communications from Monster or other parties, you may change your preferences by [logging into your account](https://web.archive.org/Login.aspx "logging into your account").
