If there is a change in ownership of TickPick, including through a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of assets to another entity, we may sell or otherwise transfer all information you provide to us, including personally identifiable information, to that entity. The Security of Your Information TickPick employs various physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to help protect the integrity and security of our systems and to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personally identifiable information that we control. For example, we scramble your password during transmission and limit the employees who can access personally identifiable information to a small set who need such information to perform their jobs. These measures notwithstanding, TickPick is not in a position to guarantee the security of user information, and absolves itself of any responsibility for any security breach that may occur, to the fullest extent of the law. If TickPick learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically, either by email on via our website, so that you can take appropriate protective steps. These methods of communicating with you are only examples. We retain the right to decide which method we will use to notify you of a security breach, and will do so consistent with our legal obligations.
