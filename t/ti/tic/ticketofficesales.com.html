<ul>
<li><strong>Registration:</strong><br> <span>You may be asked first to complete a registration form and provide personally identifiable information; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Site may choose to offer, including, but not limited to, Newsletters, Contests, Forums, Fantasy or other subscription based services.<br> <br> </span></li>

<li><strong>Cookies:</strong><br> <span>As with many Websites, the Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your Web browser to the Site whenever you visit the Site, and make using the Site easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Site are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Site. Cookies may also allow the Site to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser; however, some areas of the Site may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.<br> <br> </span></li>
<li><strong>IP Addresses and Click-stream Data:</strong><br> <span>We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors.

</ul>
<p><strong>How We Use the Information We Collect</strong><br> <span>We internally use personally identifiable information about our customers to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and provide better service to our customers.<br> <br> </span> <span>We may occasionally use a customer's email address and, in rare situations mailing address or phone number, to contact a customer regarding administrative matters or notices.<br> <br> </span> <span>We may use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.<br> <br> </span></p>
<p><strong>With Whom the Information May Be Shared</strong><br> <span>Information we collect may be accessed by a variety of parties, depending upon the project for which the information was originally collected, the terms of that engagement, and the policies into or out of which the consumer has opted. From time to time, we may send you offers from Ticket Office Sales, its affiliated properties, and our promotional partners based on the information you have provided us. In addition, we may provide information we collect about you with third party companies regarding promotions, sweepstakes and other opportunities/offers. These third parties are subject to stringent data security and confidentiality requirements and, upon completion of their fulfillment services, all information is returned to Ticket Office Sales or is destroyed.<br> <br> </span> <span>While we believe this disclosure of your information will result in opportunities that may be of interest to you, you have the right to tell us not to give your information to any third party. If you want Ticket Office Sales to keep all of your information we have collected confidential and not share it with any third party, please submit a written request to email address:&nbsp;</span><span><strong><em><a href="http://mce_host/admin/sales@ticketofficesales.com">sales@ticketofficesales.com</a> <br> </em></strong> <br> </span> <span>Your request must include your name, email address, and mailing address.

<p><strong>What Choices Do I Have About Ticket Office Sales Collecting, Using, and Sharing My Information</strong><br> <span>It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information -- to limit e-mail communications from SITE and from our third-party partners. You can request at any time that Ticket Office Sales&nbsp;not send future e-mails to you, either by unsubscribing from the communication, or by contacting us directly. Also, as mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected through technology -- though some of our features won't work if you decide to do this.<br> <br> </span> <span><strong>What Security Precautions are in Place to Protect Against Loss, Misuse, or Alteration of Your Information?</strong><br> </span><span>We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information.

You are not required to provide any personal information when using these areas but you may choose to do so.

We cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.<br> <br> </span> <strong>Links to Other Websites</strong><br> <span>You should be aware that when you are on the Site you could be directed to other sites beyond our control. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement, the "click" may take you off the Site onto a different Website. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use the Site's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Site, you should consult that site's privacy policy before providing any personal information.<br> <br> </span> <strong>A Special Note For Parents Concerning Privacy</strong><br> <span>We do not encourage children to participate in providing us with any personally identifiable information.

This can be done by making changes to your profile, by using an option out message in an email, or by emailing us.&nbsp;<br> <br> </span> <strong>Who To Contact with Questions or Concerns About This Privacy Policy</strong><br> <span>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, please contact Ticket Office Sales&nbsp;by sending an e-mail to: </span><span><a href="http://mce_host/admin/sales@ticketofficesales.com"><em><strong>sales@ticketofficesales.com</strong></em></a><br> </span></p>		</div>
