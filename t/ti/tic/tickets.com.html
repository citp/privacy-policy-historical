<p>Privacy Oversight Statement</p>

<p>As a company, Tickets.com believes so strongly in protecting consumer
privacy that we are a member of the BBB Online Privacy program. BBBOnline is
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
BBBOnLine's mission is to promote trust and confidence on the Internet
through, the BBBOnLine Reliability and the BBBOnLine Privacy programs.</p>

<p>The BBBOnLine privacy program features verification, monitoring and review,
consumer dispute resolution, a compliance seal, enforcement mechanisms and
an educational component. </p>

<p>The BBBOnLine privacy program: </p>
<ul>
<li>Awards a "seal" to businesses that post online privacy policies that meet
the required "core" principles, such as disclosure, choice, and
security.</li>

<li>Provides consumer-friendly dispute settlement</li>

<li>Monitors compliance through rigorous requirements for participating
companies to undertake, at least annually, an assessment of their online
privacy practices, and,</li>

<li>Offers specific consequences for non-compliance, such as seal withdrawal,
publicity and referral to government enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our participation in the Privacy Program means we follow the basic principle
of the program, "say what you do, do what you say and have it verified."</p>

<p>Information Collection - Notice and Disclosure Statement</p>
 
<p>From time to time, Tickets.com may ask customers to provide personal
information that will help the Company efficiently perform various
transactions. That information may be sought as you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register for general information</li>

<li>Register for a free trial or demonstration of certain products and
services</li>

<li>Sign up or subscribe to products and services</li>

<li>Participate in a special offer or contest</li>
</ol>

<p>The Company does not collect personal information -- names, addresses, phone
numbers, email addresses or credit card numbers -- about you except when you
specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis; like, for
instance, purchase sports or
entertainment tickets, or make inquiries about ticket or reservation
availability.</p> 

<p>The Company may utilize your personal information in several discrete
ways.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are purchasing sports or entertainment tickets, the Company
utilizes your personal information to communicate with you about your ticket
order or ticket inquiry. Also, as is always the case whenever you buy a
ticket to a sports or entertainment event, the entertainment organization is
entitled to know the name and address of all who purchased a ticket. The
Company has no control whatsoever over the entertainment organization's use
of that information.</li>

<li>If you come to our web site from one of our strategic partners or
register with us, your personal information provided to us may be shared
with our strategic partners and used in accordance with their standard
policies.</li>

<li>As a valued customer of Tickets.com the Company will occasionally contact
you, typically by email (or any other way you prefer) in order to notify you
of special ticketing promotions, and up-to-date news, custom-tailored to
your personal sports, and entertainment interests. Of course, if you
do not wish to receive this personalized information, you can always let us
know by e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:webfeedback@tickets.com">webfeedback@tickets.com</a>, and we will happily abide by
your wishes.</li>

<li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to contact
you, utilizing your personal information, to inform you of information that
might affect your sports or entertainment experience.</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p>Tickets.com users should be aware that if they voluntarily disclose personal
information in the reas, on bulletin boards, or in classified
areas within the Company's web site, that information might be collected and

<p>At present the Data Protection Act 1984 remains in force in the UK until the
new Data Protection Act of 1998 is implemented to enforce the European
Directive on Data Protection. The new Data Protection Act that implements
the EU Data Protection directive within the UK will repeal the 1984 Act. The
EU Directive set October 1998 as the date by which Member States are
required to have their national law operational. The new law is now an
official law but is not yet fully implemented. The current law is based on
eight common sense principles that cover the collection and processing of
personal data. The 1984 Act also requires all data users to register the
purposes for which they intend to process personal data. The basic
principles of Data Protection from the 1984 Act can be summarized as
follows:</p> 
<ol>
<li>The First Principle: The information to be contained in personal data
shall be obtained, and personal data shall be processed, fairly and
lawfully.</li> 

<li>The Second Principle: Personal data shall be held only for one or more
specified and lawful purposes.</li>

<li>The Third Principle: Personal data held for any purpose or purposes shall
not be used or disclosed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or
those purposes.</li>

<li>The Fourth Principle: Personal data for any purpose or purposes shall be
adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to that purpose or those
purposes.</li> 

<li>The Fifth Principle: Personal data shall be accurate and, where
necessary, kept up to date. </li>

<li>The Sixth Principle: Personal data held for any purpose or purposes shall
not be kept for longer than necessary for that purpose or those
purposes.</li>

<li>The Seventh Principle: An individual shall be entitled - </li>
	<ol type=a>
	<li>at reasonable intervals and without undue delay or expense to be
	informed by any data user whether he holds personal data of which that
	individual is the subject; and to allow access to any such data held by a
	data user</li> 

	<li>where appropriate, to have such data corrected or erased. </li>
	</ol>
<li>The Eighth Principle: Appropriate security measures shall be taken
against unauthorized access to, or alteration, disclosure or destruction of,
personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of personal
data.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Commonwealth Privacy Act 1998 implements strict privacy protection which
Commonwealth and government agencies must observe when collecting, storing,
using and disclosing personal information. Other Commonwealth laws contain
privacy provisions relating to information about health insurance claims,
data matching, information about old criminal convictions and personal
information disclosed by telecommunications companies. The Privacy Act
applies to the private sector only with respect to tax file numbers and
consumer credit information. The Federal Privacy Commissioner has encouraged
Australian businesses to develop voluntary industry codes of conduct to meet
privacy standards. In February 1998, the Commissioner issued a document
entitled "National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal
Information." The National Principles are based on the OECD Guidelines.
These Principles address the collection, use, and disclosure of data; data
quality and security; openness, access and correction; identifiers,
anonymity, trans-border data flows and sensitive information. In December
1998, the Federal Government announced that it intends to enact legislation
to strengthen self-regulatory privacy protection in the private sector. They
also announced that the legislation that will be introduced would be based
on the National Principles. The Company is committed to adherence to
industry codes of conduct and/or legislation that will be required to
process data in Australia and respects the privacy rights of the citizens of
Australia.</p>

Back to <a href="http://www.nl.tickets.com">Netherlands' homepage</a>

<p>The Netherlands enacted the Data Protection Act (DPA or the Act) on July 1,
1989. The DPA promotes self-regulation, and provides consumers with certain
rights, including notice, access to information, disclosure and correction
of inaccuracies. It requires those in control of personal data files to take
measures to assure only authorized disclosures and ensure informational
accuracy. Lastly, the DPA allows consumers to seek and obtain compensation
for damages. The Act applies to personal data files relating to living
individuals. Collection of data for personal or private use is excluded from
its provisions. When certain requirements are met, a corporation may bring
an action under the Act's provisions, however, the Act itself does not apply
to data concerning corporations. </p>

<p>The Act creates the Chamber of Registration which is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitoring privacy development </li>

<li>advising the cabinet on privacy matters </li>

<li>enforcing the provisions of the Act </li>
</ul>
<p>Your Rights as the Consumer</p>

<p>A consumer must be informed of the collection of data within one month in
writing. Notice must contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>purpose of the file </li>

<li>name and address of file controller </li>
</ul>

<p>A consumer must be informed of their right to question the existence,
accuracy, and origin of data. </p>

<p>Information Bureaus </p>

<p>Information bureaus may gather information that affects the rights of
consumer'ss. For example, a credit bureau may gather information relating to
a consumer's's creditworthiness. Consent is required for the issuance and
dissemination of such information and such consent must be in writing. Data
may be issued to a third party if in conjunction with the purpose of the
file, on request for research or statistical purposes, or "on the grounds of
urgent and important considerations." The Act applies to all civilian
collections of personal data, regardless of residency status in the
Netherlands. It also applies to foreign files having a Dutch file controller
and containing personal data about Netherlands residents. There are certain
limited exemptions that may be granted in trans-border data dissemination,
however, exemptions are only granted to those countries with adequate data
protection laws. The Act limits access to foreign data files dictated by a
foreign controller. A total ban on the transfer of data can be issued if it
is established that the privacy of an individual in threatened.</p>

<p>The Canadian government passed two acts, the Access to Information Act
("AIA") and the Privacy Act on July 1, 1983 to balance the need for data
processing with the competing interests of Canadian citizens for protection
of their privacy. Although the AIA received more media attention, it is the
Privacy Act that guarantees citizens the right to privacy.</p>

<p>The Privacy Act - General Provisions </p>

<p>The Privacy Act ensures the right of every Canadian citizen and permanent

<p>Privacy in Hong Kong</p>

<p>Hong Kong enacted the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Ordinance) which
entered into force December 20, 1996. The Privacy Commission Office is an
independent statutory body set up to oversee the enforcement of the
Ordinance. The Ordinance has as its core purpose the protection of privacy
interests of living, identifiable individuals in relation to personal data.
It also contributes to Hong Kong's continued economic well being by
safeguarding the free flow of personal data to Hong Kong from restrictions
by countries that already have data protection laws. The Ordinance binds the
government to ensure the protection of privacy rights of its citizens. Where
there is a conflict between the Ordinance and any other legislative action
or ordinance, the Privacy Ordinance takes precedence. The Ordinance states
its mission as: "A data user shall not do an act, or engage in a practice,
that contravenes data protection principle unless the act or practice, as
the case may be, is required or permitted under this Ordinance."</p>

<p>The Ordinance provides certain rights to consumers including:</p>
<ul>
<li>access </li>

<li>correction or erasure </li>

<li>copies of information held </li>

<li>complaint procedures for denial of access and </li>

<li>compensation for damages suffered as a result of unauthorized disclosure
or misuse. </li>
</ul>
<p>Consumers must be informed of: the rights and obligations of compliance;
penalties or consequences for failure to do so; purpose of the data
collection; any anticipated third party disclosure; and rights of access and
correction. Personal data should not be kept longer than necessary to the
fulfillment of the purpose for which they are collected </p>

<p>Data transferred to Hong Kong from other jurisdictions will generally become
subject to the requirements of the Ordinance. Section 33 of the Ordinance
regulates the transfer of data out of Hong Kong. This section provides for
an equivalence test of protection, rather than the adequacy test of the EU
Directive. It permits transfers to jurisdictions lacking a data privacy
regime where the interests of the consumer are otherwise adequately
protected. Examples are where consent has been obtained or there are
contractual assurances in place that the data protection principles will be
respected. </p>

Back to <a href="http://www.de.tickets.com">Germany's homepage</a>

<p>Data protection in Germany has come in two phases. The Federal Data
Protection Act (BDSG) was adopted January 27, 1977. The major provisions
came into force January 1, 1978 and the technical and organizational
measures became effective on January 1, 1979. The BDSG was then replaced in
1991 by a new data protection act which took advantage of the experiences
and technical improvements of the previous years as well as judicial
opinions of the Federal Constitutional court.. Data protection in Germany
centers around important concepts of general privacy, human rights and the
balance between access to information and privacy concerns. Basically, the
German data protection law embodies "informationelles
Selbstbestimmungsrecht" -- the basic right of the individual to decide on
the use and communication of his or her personal data. This tenet is
paramount, with the caveat of overriding social or public concerns. The main
purpose of the Act is to "protect the individual against his right to
privacy being impaired through the handling of his personal data." The Act
states that the "processing and use of personal data shall be admissible
only if this Act or any other legal provision permits or prescribes them or
the consumer's has consented." But the Act may be superseded by the
interests of the state. The Act states that insofar as "other legal
provisions of the Federation are applicable to personal data, including
their publication, such provisions shall take precedence over the provisions
of this Act." </p>

<p>Personal data is defined as "any information concerning the personal or
material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual."
Dissemination of personal data to third persons is limited but permissible,
as long as there is no threat of harm to the consumer's or his
interests.</p>

<p>A consumer has the right of notification of collection of data, notification
of content, purpose and identity of recipients and the rights of correction,
erasure or blocking. Blocking is defined as the labeling of stored personal
data so as to restrict further processing or use. This information must be
transmitted to the consumer in writing and free of charge. If a file
controller refuses access, a consumer's has the right to appeal to the
Federal Commissioner for Data Protection. In general, communication and
storage of data is permissible if the business has identifiable and
justifiable interests. There are no restrictions, for instance, on
information regarding membership in a group, occupation, birth year, name,
title, academic degree or address. These categories are not sensitive by
their nature and may be of legitimate interest or use of a file controller.
Restrictions do apply to sensitive data relating to health, criminal
offenses, administrative offenses, or religious or political
convictions.</p>

<a name="belgium"><p>Privacy in Belgium</p></a>

Back to <a href="http://www.be.tickets.com">Belgium's homepage</a>

<p>Belgium enacted the Belgium Data Protection Act (BDPA) on December 8, 1992,
to ensure that personal data may only be processed for clearly described and
justified purposes and may not be used in a manner incompatible with these
purposes. </p>

<p>With regard to sensitive personal data, there are more specific, more
stringent rules that must be observed by the file controller. These rules
apply to three categories of personal data: highly sensitive, medical and
judicial data. Highly sensitive data refers to information on the subject's
race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or behavior, political activity or
opinion, religious and philosophical beliefs and membership in labor unions.
Appropriate groups may, of course, keep membership lists.</p> 

 

<p>The consumer's has the right to information, access, correction or deletion
of inaccurate or illegally stored data, appeal and information about these
rights. The BDPA refers to information collected both directly from and
indirectly about the consumer's. This applies to all consumers in Belgium,
including foreign consumers, even when further processing occurs outside of
Belgium.</p> 

<p>The consumer's has the right to access information directly or through the
Privacy Commission. For direct access, the consumer's must submit a written
request to the company and can be charged a fee. The company must respond
within 45 days with the information. A consumer has a right to correct any
misinformation collected free of charge. They must submit a request to the
company who must respond within one month and inform any consumer of the
correction or deletion. The company must keep the identity of any third
consumer for at least one year. A consumer's has the right to appeal any
adverse decision through a complaint to the Privacy Commission or before the
Chairman of the Court of First Instance. A consumer has the right to be
informed of these rights and their methods of exercise. The BDPA doesn't
explicitly prohibit or restrict the merging of personal data from
different</p>

<p>Privacy in Italy</p>

 

<p>Italy enacted the Processing of Personal Data Act (the Act) in September,
1993. The Act is designed to "ensure that the processing of personal data is
carried out by respecting the rights, fundamental freedoms and dignity of
natural persons, especially as related to privacy and personal identity..."
Personal data is defined under the Act as "any information relating to
natural or legal persons, bodies or associations that are or can be
identified, even indirectly, by reference to any other information including
by a personal identification number..." The law applies to the processing of
personal data carried out by any person on Italian soil. It does not apply
to data collected for purely personal use, provided that the data are not
intended for systematic communication or dissemination. The Act applies to
the processing, "on the State's territory, of personal data kept in a
foreign country."</p>

<p>All data collected must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processed lawfully and fairly </li>

<li>Collected and recorded for specific purposes </li>

<li>Accurate and, when necessary, kept up to date </li>

<li>Adequate, relevant and not excessive to the stated purpose of collection
</li>

<li>Kept in a form that permits identification of the consumer for no longer
than is necessary for the purpose of collection. </li>
</ul>
 

<p>A consumer has certain rights in regard to the collection of data including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of collection </li>

<li>An opt in for data collection </li>

<li>The consequences for failure to provide data </li>

<li>Any third party transmission anticipated </li>

<li>The name, denomination or trade name, domicile, residence or registered
office of the company processing and/or storing the data </li>

<p>Privacy in Denmark</p>

 

<p>Unlike the other Scandinavian countries, Denmark has passed two acts
relative to the protection of privacy and access to information: the Private
Registers Act and the Public Registers Act. These acts were adopted by the
Danish Folkerting (Parliament) in 1978 and became law January 1, 1979.
Amendments were made in 1987. The acts affect "personal data" defined as
"data that are referable to identifiable individuals even if such referral
presupposes knowledge of the personal registration number or any particular
means of identification of such individual." Personal data is data that
permit, in any form, directly or indirectly, the identification of the
natural persons to which they relate, irrespective of whether the processing
is done by a natural or legal person. </p>

<p>A consumer now has the right to know what is registered about him and may
submit a request of access once every 12 months. Response must be within
four weeks and complaints regarding denial or delay are made to the DSA.
</p>

 

<p>Tickets.com will ensure that: </p>
<ul>
<li>The purposes of data collection and processing are being clearly
specified</li>

<li>Only information that is relevant and necessary for the original purpose
is being processed </li>

<li>Our customers will be able to contact us to obtain what information we are
storing to determine that the information is up to date and accurate </li>

<li>Personal information is not kept any longer than required </li>
</ul>
<p>Personal information will only be processed with the your consent. You are
entitled to withdraw consent at any time. </p>

<p>Personal information may be transferred to other countries. The Company will
obtain approval from the DSA prior to any transfer so that the DSA can
determine if that country can secure adequate data protection. Adequate
protection will be decided based on the type of data to be transferred, the
purpose of the transfer, the country of (the data's) origin, the country of
(the data's) destination, as well as data protection rules and guidelines in
place in the receiving country. Data may be transferred with the your
consent if the transfer is considered necessary for the completion of a
purchase on our site.</p>

<p>In addition, Danish regulatory authorities may permit the transfer of
personal data to countries lacking adequate protection, if the data
controller can provide satisfactory guarantees for the protection of the
data subject. The regulatory authorities will notify the European Commission
and the EU member states about any data transfers under the latter rule.
