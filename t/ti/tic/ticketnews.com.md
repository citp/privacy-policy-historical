TicketNews.com only has access to personally identifiable information provided by and with the full consent and intent of the user via on-site submission forms or any user-initiated contact. This information is used only as it relates to the user's intended actions (e.g. registering for a user account, or subscribing to a mailing list). We do not sell or rent this information to anyone.

Any sensitive information requested on behalf of TicketNews.com for the completion of a merchandise order is handled through a secure processing page operated by PayPal.

**USER ACCOUNTS**

Access to all public content and basic levels of functionality is free and available to all site users. User accounts are also available and allow the creation of an identifying username, but are not mandatory for regular site use. Personal information used in the creation of the user account (e.g. name, e-mail address) remains private and is not visible to other site users. 

Upon creating a user account, an account activation e-mail will be sent by TicketNews.com to the address provided by the user. This e-mail includes a one-time password, which the user is asked to change when first logging into the new account. Users retain sole responsibility for creating and maintaining a secure password for their account; a new password may be created under the "Edit" tab of "My Account" when logged in. In the event of a forgotten password, the user may [request a new password](https://web.archive.org/user/password), which is delivered via automated e-mail and not recorded or filed by TicketNews.com.

Users are free to delete their accounts at any time; the option is available under the "Edit" tab of "My Account." For assistance in deleting an account, contact [editorial@ticketnews.com](mailto:editorial@ticketnews.com). Please provide the username to be deleted; the e-mail request must originate from the address used to create the account. Accounts deemed to be suspicious, spam, or otherwise harmful to the user in question or the TicketNews.com community as a whole may be deleted at the sole discretion of TicketNews.com and without prior notice.

   
**SUBSCRIPTION E-MAIL SERVICES**

TicketNews.com may send daily and weekly newsletters, breaking reports, special promotions and other forms of subscription e-mail to its users. These services are provided free of charge to users who have consented to and provided contact information explicitly for the receipt of e-mail communications from TicketNews.com.

   
**TICKETNEWSFEED WIDGET**

TicketNews.com offers, as a convenience, the option to install the TicketNewsfeed Widget on the user's personal Web site, blog, social networking profile or other Internet-based platform. The Widget is hosted by TicketNews.com and presented as-is; its code may not be "hacked" or modified by the user other than via basic color customization options offered on TicketNews.com.

Operation or use of the Widget does not require any input or storage of the user's personal information. The feed employs a non-personal tracking code for general analytic purposes related to overall click-through rates from the Widget's in-bound links to TicketNews.com and its content.
