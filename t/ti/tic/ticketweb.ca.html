            <p> We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment 
              to protecting information you submit. This privacy policy only applies 
              to transactions made, and data gathered, on the TicketWeb.com web 
              site (the “Site”), and does not apply to any other transactions, 
              information, web site or Internet, telephone or offline point of 
              contact between TicketWeb and you or other consumers. Please review 
              this privacy policy periodically as we may update it from time to 
              time. This privacy policy was last revised on December 21, 2004. 
              Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, by 
              doing so you are accepting the practices described in this privacy 
              policy at that time. You agree that by using the Site you are consenting 
              to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and 
              consenting to receive emails, as described below in this privacy 
              policy. </p>
            <p> <strong> <span class="subHeadPurple">Who We Are</span><br>
              <br>
              Disclosure and Use of Information within and to the Ticketmaster 
              Family Companies<br>
              </strong>When we say "we" or "TicketWeb" in 
              this privacy policy, we mean TicketWeb, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 
              TicketWeb is part of a family of companies that are ultimately owned 
              by the same company. Many companies in this family operate under 
              the brand "Ticketmaster". When we say "Ticketmaster 
              Family Companies" in this privacy policy, we mean these Ticketmaster-branded 
              companies. Any information that you provide to TicketWeb may be 
              shared by TicketWeb with the Ticketmaster Family Companies, who 
              may share it with each other and use it to operate the business 
              of TicketWeb and the Ticketmaster Family Companies. Additionally, 
              the Ticketmaster Family Companies may use that information to contact 
              you to the same extent that TicketWeb may contact you under this 
              privacy policy. However, the Ticketmaster Family Companies will 
              all be subject to the terms of this privacy policy in how they use 
              and disclose that information. The Ticketmaster Family Companies 
              do not include "Other Corporate Affiliates" (i.e., those 
              other companies that are ultimately owned by the same company as 
              the one that ultimately owns TicketWeb but that do not operate under 
              the "Ticketmaster" brand-examples of just some of the 
              "Other Corporate Affiliates" include Expedia, HSN, Hotels.com, 
              Hotwire, Lending Tree, ReserveAmerica, Admission, Match.com, Evite, 
              EPI and Citysearch). Other Corporate Affiliates, as well as non-affiliated 
              companies, are referred to in this privacy policy as "others," 
              "other companies" or "third parties."</p>
            <p> <span class="subHeadPurple"><strong>Information We Collect From 
              You</strong></span></p>
            <p> We may collect "contact information" (i.e., information 
              that could be used to contact you such as full name, postal address, 
              phone number and email address as well as your computer's unique 
              IP address (if any)), "financial information" (i.e., passwords, 
              credit and debit card numbers and bank and other financial institution 
              account numbers) and "demographic information" (e.g., 
              zip code, postal code, hometown, gender, purchase history information 
              and age as well as IP addresses that are not unique to your computer) 
              from you. Please note that nowhere on the Site do we knowingly collect 
              contact information or financial information from children under 
              the age of 13. </p>
            <p><br>
              <span class="subHeadPurple"><strong>How We Use Contact Information; 
              Responsibility</strong></span></p>
            <p><strong><em> </em>Order and Payment Processing, Customer Service, 
              Credit Card Issuers and Quality Assurance.<br>
              </strong>We use contact information to help us efficiently perform 
              transactions, to deliver the services you have requested, to perform 
              quality assurance, sales analyses and other business analyses, and 
              to contact you in connection with events for which you purchased 
              tickets (including event confirmations, changes and cancellations). 
              In some cases we may use service providers to help us perform some 
              of these tasks, including, but not limited to, processing or fulfilling 
              your orders, or performing customer service, business analyses or 
              quality control, and consequently we may share your contact information 
              with these service providers. In such cases, we often require these 
              service providers to enter into agreements with us regarding the 
              confidential handling of your information. We may also provide your 
              contact information to your credit card issuer or to credit card 
              processors for their purposes. When you make a purchase through 
              the Site, or register with the Site, you will provide us with an 
              email address where we, or these service providers, may contact 
              you for the purposes described in this paragraph.</p>
            <p> <strong>Contacting You for Offers and Promotions.</strong><br>
              In connection with ordering tickets through the Site, or registering 
              with the Site, we will ask you to provide your email address. We 
              will use and disclose that email address for customer service and 
              those other purposes described in this privacy policy. You will 
              also be given the opportunity to tell us whether you want us to 
              send you promotional emails at that email address. "Promotional 
              emails" are emails that are sent solely for promotional purposes. 
              For your convenience, we will have pre-checked a box indicating 
              that you do want to receive these emails. If you do not want us 
              to send promotional emails to an email address simply uncheck the 
              box when you provide that email address, or visit My Account to 
              unsubscribe. Because many consumers like to receive some, but not 
              all, types of promotional emails, the Site may provide you with 
              the ability to determine the types of emails that you want to receive. 
              Please note that if you ask not to receive promotional emails from 
              TicketWeb, you may still receive non-promotional emails from TicketWeb, 
              and you may still receive emails from certain others (including, 
              but not limited to, Event Providers (defined below)); please read 
              the rest of this privacy policy to learn how others may contact 
              you.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Providing Event Providers with Contact Information.<br>
              </strong> TicketWeb sells tickets on behalf of others; it does not 
              produce or otherwise bring you events. Venues, promoters, bands, 
              teams, leagues and others ("Event Providers") produce 
              and bring you events. When you use TicketWeb to order tickets (or 
              to register while attempting to order Tickets), instead of providing 
              your information directly to Event Providers, you provide your contact 
              information to TicketWeb who may then pass that information on to 
              the Event Providers on your behalf-in fact, when you purchase tickets 
              or register to purchase tickets from TicketWeb, you consent for 
              us to provide your email address and other information to the Event 
              Providers. This will allow Event Providers to contact you using 
              the email address or other contact information you provided. Because 
              Event Providers are not part of TicketWeb or the Ticketmaster Family 
              Companies, Event Providers are not subject to this privacy policy 
              and may still use your contact information to communicate with you 
              by sending emails or through other means, and may share your contact 
              information with others. If you want to learn about a particular 
              Event Provider's privacy policies, or you do not want to receive 
              communications from a particular Event Provider, or you have other 
              questions, instructions or concerns to which you would like an Event 
              Provider to respond, then you must contact that Event Provider directly. 
              Also, you may contact an Event Provider directly to learn whether 
              you may purchase tickets to the Event Provider's event anonymously 
              (i.e., without having that Event Provider receive your contact information) 
              by purchasing tickets directly through the Event Provider's box 
              office using cash instead of purchasing through TicketWeb. </p>
            <p><strong> Providing Merchants with Contact Information.<br>
              </strong>In addition to selling event tickets, TicketWeb may sell 
              other goods or services, allow you to make reservations, or allow 
              you to participate in (or register for) contests, sweepstakes or 
              other offers or programs (such as discount or rewards programs, 
              magazine subscriptions, hotel bookings or cruises) on the Site. 
              Typically, these goods, services, contests, sweepstakes or other 
              offers or programs ("Special Offers") for which you make 
              purchases, orders or reservations, or for which you participate 
              in or register, are provided by third parties ("Merchants"). 
              Consequently, if you elect to engage in a Merchant's Special Offer, 
              TicketWeb may provide that Merchant with your contact information-in 
              fact, when you elect to engage in a Merchant's Special Offer you 
              consent for us to provide your email address and other information 
              to that Merchant. Because Merchants are not part of TicketWeb or 
              the Ticketmaster Family Companies, Merchants are not subject to 
              this privacy policy and may use your contact information to communicate 
              with you by sending emails or through other means, and may share 
              your contact information with others. If you want to learn about 
              a particular Merchant's privacy policies, or you do not want to 
              receive communications from a particular Merchant, or you have other 
              questions, instructions or concerns to which you would like a Merchant 
              to respond, then you must contact that Merchant directly. </p>
            <p><strong> Divulging Your Contact Information for Legal and Administrative 
              Reasons.<br>
              </strong>We may disclose specific contact information when we determine 
              that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to cooperate 
              with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests 
              or safety of TicketWeb or other visitors to the Site or users of 
              services or products provided by TicketWeb. Also, your contact information 
              may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of 
              ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy, of TicketWeb. </p>
            <p><strong>Providing Other Corporate Affiliates with Contact Information.<br>
              </strong>We may also share your contact information with our Other 
              Corporate Affiliates (as defined above), but each Other Corporate 
              Affiliate who receives your contact information will comply with 
              the terms of this privacy policy with respect to its use and disclosure 
              of the contact information we share with it, unless the Other Corporate 
              Affiliate is also receiving it because it is an Event Provider or 
              Merchant as described above (in which case it will not be required 
              to comply with this privacy policy with respect to its use or disclosure 
              of such information).</p>
            <p><strong> Other Instances where Contact Information may be Shared.<br>
              </strong>If you are opted out of receiving all promotional emails, 
              then we will not share your contact information with unaffiliated 
              third parties, unless we are otherwise permitted to under this privacy 
              policy (for example, we will still be permitted to share your contact 
              information with Event Providers or Merchants but only to the extent 
              permitted above). If you do not opt out of receiving all promotional 
              emails, then we may share your contact information if we believe 
              it makes business sense. These third parties may communicate directly 
              with you about their products and services.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Responsibility.<br>
              </strong>TicketWeb will not be responsible or otherwise liable for 
              any use or disclosure of your contact information by a third party 
              to whom TicketWeb is allowed to disclose your contact information 
              under this privacy policy.</p>
            <p><strong> How We Use Financial Information; Responsibility<br>
              </strong>We use your financial information to check your qualifications, 
              to help us efficiently perform sales and other transactions, to 
              deliver the goods and services you have requested, to enroll you 
              in the discount, rebate and other programs in which you elect to 
              participate and to perform quality assurance. In some cases we may 
              use, and consequently we may provide to service providers, your 
              financial information to help us perform some of these tasks. In 
              such cases, we will require these service providers to enter into 
              agreements with us regarding the confidential handling of your information. 
              We may also provide your financial information to your credit card 
              issuer, financial institutions or credit card processors to process 
              transactions and for their other purposes, as well as to the Ticketmaster 
              Family Companies who may share it among themselves. We may provide 
              your financial information to Event Providers, primarily for facilitating 
              "will call" ticket pick up, dispute resolution and customer 
              service at the event venue on the date of the event, and may provide 
              your financial information to those Merchants who are providing 
              you with the goods, services or reservations you purchase or order, 
              or who are administering the offers or programs you enter or see 
              promoted, through the Site.</p>
            <p> We may disclose specific financial information when we determine 
              that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to cooperate 
              with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests 
              or safety of TicketWeb or other visitors to the Site or users of 
              services or products provided by TicketWeb. Also, your financial 
              information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a 
              transfer of ownership or assets, or a bankruptcy, of TicketWeb.</p>
            <p> TicketWeb will not be responsible or otherwise liable for any 
              use or disclosure of your financial information by a third party 
              to whom TicketWeb is allowed to disclose your financial information 
              under this privacy policy.</p>
            <p><strong> How We Use Demographic Information<br>
              </strong>We may use your demographic information to perform business 
              analyses or to tailor the Site and communications to your interests. 
              We may share anonymous, aggregated (grouped) demographic information 
              with advertisers and other third parties so that they can tailor 
              their advertisements and communications to the appropriate audience. 
              Any time that we are allowed under this privacy policy to share 
              your contact information or financial information, we may also share 
              your demographic information along with it.</p>
            <p><strong> Information Other Web Sites Collect From You<br>
              </strong>On the Site, we place links to other web sites operated 
              by other parties. Some of these other web sites contain our brand 
              names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; 
              others do not. When you click on these links and visit these other 
              web sites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand names, 
              trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware 
              that we do not control these other web sites or these other web 
              sites' business practices, and that this privacy policy does not 
              apply to these other web sites. Consequently, the operators of these 
              other web sites may collect different kinds of information about 
              you, and may use and disclose that information in different ways 
              than we would if it were collected on the Site. We encourage you 
              to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will not 
              be responsible for their actions.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Your IP Address<br>
              </strong>Like most e-commerce Web sites, each time you visit the 
              Site, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page 
              from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Site 
              for you and to diagnose problems with our Site, we use your IP address 
              to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information 
              about you.</p>
            <p><strong> Cookies<br>
              </strong>Like most Web sites, the Site uses cookies to help it keep 
              track of your purchases and other activity on the Site and enhance 
              your experience on the Site. We also use cookies to deliver content 
              specific to your interests and to facilitate the retrieval of information 
              so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site. 
              On the Site, others may place or read cookies on your browser as 
              well. If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help" 
              portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, 
              if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able 
              to access certain areas or features of the Site.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Our Security Precautions; Geographic Location of Information<br>
              </strong>The Site has security measures in place to help protect 
              against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under 
              our control. We use secure socket layer (SSL) technology to help 
              protect the security of commerce transactions. We encrypt your contact 
              information and financial information as it travels over the Internet. 
              Your information may be transferred to and maintained in whole or 
              in part on computer networks which may be located outside of the 
              state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which 
              you reside, and may be stored on equipment or in facilities leased 
              or licensed from third parties.</p>
            <p><strong> Public Areas<br>
              </strong>The Site may provide you with the opportunity to post information 
              for display in areas of the site that are accessible to viewing 
              by the general public ("public areas"), including, but 
              not limited to, bulletin boards, chat rooms and user-submitted concert 
              or other event reviews. This privacy policy does not apply to any 
              information that you submit for use in public areas. We ask that 
              you do not submit any contact information or financial information 
              for display in public areas, as other people who use the Site will 
              see it. If you submit such information for display in public areas, 
              TicketWeb cannot prevent it from being used in a manner that violates 
              the law, your personal privacy or your safety. By submitting such 
              information for display in public areas, you assume the risks and 
              sole liability arising as a result of such information being displayed.<br>

              <strong>How You Can Access and Update Your Email Preferences, Contact 
              Information and other My Account Information; Deleting Information<br>
              </strong>You may click on the Site's My Account link and follow 
              the instructions to modify information you have previously provided 
              to us or to indicate (in greater detail) which types of promotional 
              emails you want (or do not want) to receive from us. Emails that 
              we send you may also have links to the Site's My Account section. 
              If you would like to delete a My Account account that contains your 
              information, please contact customer service. Please note that deleting 
              your account on My Account will not delete all of your contact information 
              or other information contained on our systems, as much or all of 
              this information will be retained to preserve records of our commercial 
              relationship with you. Further, certain information may have already 
              been provided to third parties as described above.</p>
            <p> Please note that changing information through your My Account 
              profile, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications 
              from TicketWeb and third parties (other than Event Providers or 
              others for whom you cannot use the Site to cause an opt-out to be 
              effective as stated above) will only change the data reflected in 
              My Account for purposes of transacting future business on the Site 
              and for managing future communications from TicketWeb. If TicketWeb 
              has already provided your information to a third party before you 
              have changed it on My Account, then it is possible that the third 
              party will not receive an update of the information reflecting the 
              change.</p>
