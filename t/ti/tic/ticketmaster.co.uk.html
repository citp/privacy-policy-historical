This cookie is set when you register or "Log In" and is modified when you "Log Out" of our services.  The Site uses cookies to keep track of what you have purchased.  We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and for other purposes relating to your transactions on the Site. We need to use cookies to ensure that everything you put in your shopping basket, stays in your basket until you check out.  If you are having trouble using online shopping, be sure your web browser is configured to accept cookies. Otherwise online shopping will not work properly. Usually, you should not have any trouble using online shopping with a dial-up connection to an ISP (for example, from home). If you are having trouble using online shopping from work, the problem may be how your web browser is configured or how your corporate firewall or proxy server is configured. Try using a connection that doesn't go through a firewall (for example, a modem connection to an ISP) or contact your MIS department for assistance.  Third party advertisers may place cookies on your browser as well if you click on such advertisement.

Depending on your selection, your contact information may be used to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on our Site. Your contact information may be provided to the venues and selected promoters of concerts and events for which you purchase tickets. 
We also may use customer contact information we collect in order to send you information and offers from our company, our subsidiaries and promotional material from some of our partners.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not disclose your name or address to any outside organization unless compelled by law.  If a third party serves on us a subpoena or other lawful document compelling disclosure of your identity, we will use our best efforts to provide you notice to the latest address in our files provided, however, that we are not responsible if your contact information is not current or if we are otherwise unable to provide notice.  
Your contact information will be passed on to a successor in interest in the event or bankruptcy, receivership or other transfer of ownership.
