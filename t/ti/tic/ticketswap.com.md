We use ip address, Facebook country, IBAN country and country given in your profile as measures to locate you.

In the case of non-compliance, we retain the right to keep your (relevant) data and information in our records for future reference. This means that by violating the Platform Agreement, our right to hold on to your information supersedes data protection rules in which you are allowed to request that we delete all your data from our systems.
