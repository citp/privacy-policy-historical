# Ticketmaster - Help

Ticketmaster is part of the IAC family of businesses, which has grown in recent years to include over 60 brands including Ask.com, Citysearch, Evite, Gifts.com, HSN, LendingTree, Match.com, RealEstate.com, ServiceMagic, and many others. For a list of all of IAC’s businesses, please visit [www.iac.com](http://www.iac.com/). In order to help customers clearly understand our data collection and use practices, IAC has decided to have its businesses follow a standard set of privacy practices and use a standard format to describe their privacy practices. The following Consumer Privacy statement applies to all IAC businesses. In addition, Ticketmaster has revised its [privacy policy](http://www.ticketmaster.com/h/privacyrights.html), effective July 15, 2007, consistent with the IAC privacy commitment and standard privacy policy format. Refer to our [FAQs](http://www.ticketmaster.com/h/privacyfaq.html) for details about the changes. Please review both the Consumer Privacy statement and this site’s complete privacy policy.
