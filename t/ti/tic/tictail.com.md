# Privacy Policy - Tictail

Your privacy is important to us at Tictail, Inc. (“ _Tictail_ ,” “ _we_ ,” “ _us_ ,” or “ _our_ ”), so we’ve created this privacy policy (this “ _Privacy Policy_ ”) to explain Tictail’s information collection and use practices in connection with the Service. You’re bound to the Privacy Policy, too: it’s part of the Agreement, and by using the Service you agree that you have read it, that you understand it, and that you will comply with it.

If you see any capitalized terms that aren’t defined in this Privacy Policy, they’ll have the meaning we give them elsewhere in the Agreement.

## 1\. The Information We Collect and/or Receive

_A. Personal Information_

When you sign up to become a User or when you purchase a Product, you may be required to provide us with personal information about yourself, including, without limitation, your name, phone number, e-mail address, and profile picture. And, if you contact us via the Contact Us page or decide to purchase a Product, you’ll need to provide your name and other contact information. All information that we receive under this section is collectively called “ _Personal Information_.” We don’t collect any Personal Information from Visitors or Users when they use the Service, unless they provide such information voluntarily. Some of this Personal Information will be publically accessible through the Service, and you agree that we may display this publically accessible Personal Information to other Users or elsewhere on the Service, by itself or in connection with Other Information (defined below) relating to your activities on the Service or with any User Content you provide.

_B. Other Information_

In addition to the Personal Information, we may collect or receive additional information (collectively, the “ _Other Information_ ”). Such Other Information may be collected:

  1. _From Your Activity_. In an ongoing effort to improve the Service and the user experience, we automatically collect certain information when Visitors and Users access and use the Service. Such information includes, without limitation, IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, Stores followed or reviewed, Products bought, what sections of the Website are accessed, what features of the Service are used, log files, and similar information and data.

  2. _From Cookies_. We collect information using “cookie” technology. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. We may use session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser), persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) or equivalent technologies (including but not limited to “Local Storage”) to help us collect Other Information and to enhance your experience using the Service. If you do not want us to place a cookie on your hard drive, you may be able to turn that feature off on your computer. Please consult your Internet browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, the Website or the Service may not function properly.

  3. _From You_. You may voluntarily provide us additional information about yourself that does not identify you personally, including, without limitation, your gender, country, product and service preferences, and other information.




_C. Billing Information_

In order to process any transactions through the Service, such as for a Product or Application, you may be required to provide certain billing information, such as information related to your PayPal account, debit card number, credit card number, expiration date, bank account information, billing address, activation code, and similar information (collectively, the “ _Billing Information_ ”). This Billing Information may be collected and processed by our third-party payment vendors (“ _Payment Platform_ ”) pursuant to the terms and conditions of their privacy policies and terms of use. If we obtain access to your Billing Information in connection with those transactions, we promise not to share it with any third parties unless it is necessary to process your transaction or administer the Service.

## 2\. The Information Collected by or Through Third-Party Advertising Companies

You authorize us to share Other Information about your activity on the Website with third parties for the purpose of tailoring, analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing advertising you see on the Website and elsewhere. These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such Other Information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us, and these third-party advertisers, to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site.

## 3\. How We Use and Share the Information

You authorize us to use the Personal Information and the Other Information (collectively, the “ _Information_ ”) to provide and improve our Website, Service, and other products and services; to process transactions you request; to inform you about our products and services and those of our promotional partners; and to bring you customized content (such as newsletters) based on your activity in connection with the Service.
