Legal basis for processing personal data
Reasons we can collect and use your personal information: Lawful basis for
processing
Under EU data protection law, there must be a lawful basis for all processing of personal data (unless
an exemption or derogation applies). We rely on:
       • Contractual necessity
                 Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data subject or to take
                steps to enter into a contract to conduct regulated activities, when processing is necessary
                for the entry into, or performance of contract with the data subject or in order to take steps
                at this or her request prior to the entry into a contract.
       • Compliance with legal obligations
                Processing is necessary for compliance with our legal obligation. Tickmill has the necessity
                for compliance with a legal obligation.
       • Legitimate interest
               Data will only be processed where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
               pursued by Tickmill, and these interests or fundamental rights are not overridden by the
               interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject and that the processing would not cause
               unwarranted harm. For instance, it is a legitimate interest of Tickmill to process personal
               data on data subjects in order to expand the business, develop new business relations
               prevention of fraud, maintaining the security of our systems if/when necessary, enhancing,
               modifying or improving our services. The data subject must be given information on the
               specific legitimate interest if a processing is based on this provision.
