### How We Use Your Information & Why

    * To send you customer service emails including booking confirmations and event reminders.
    * To prevent or detect unlawful behaviour, to protect or enforce our legal rights or as otherwise permitted by law. For example, making sure tickets get into the hands of real fans.

    * To ensure the security of our and our Event Partners’ operations.
    * To create a profile about you to help us personalise our services to you. For example, if you purchase tickets to pop events and you have consented to our marketing, we will inform you about other pop events we think you might be interested in. For further information, see section below:
