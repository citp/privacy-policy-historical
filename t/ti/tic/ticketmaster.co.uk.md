## Privacy Policy

This Policy explains what personal information Ticketmaster and its group companies (known in this Policy as " **we** " or " **Ticketmaster** ") collect and how we use it. Please read it carefully.

Generally, we collect information about you if you create an account, from your purchase of tickets, when you email or call us, or from box office purchases operated or administered by us, and when you use our websites, apps and social media. We use that and other information to provide better services, marketing and support to you and our other customers (including by analysing your information to provide you with a personalised experience).

When you, for example, create an account, purchase tickets, download one of our apps or contact us on the phone, we may ask your consent to use your information for certain purposes. Your choices about how we use information are described here.

As an authorised ticket agent, Ticketmaster sells tickets on behalf of third parties who provide or sponsor an event, or who operate a venue where we hold events. We refer to these artists, agents, venues, promoters or sponsors from whom we obtain tickets to sell to you as our " **Event Partners** ". We may share your information with our Event Partners and may share your information with other third parties, as further described here.

Ticketmaster is responsible for the processing of your personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

## We collect your information in different ways

  
**Directly from you**. For example, if you register for a promotion, create an account, enter a competition or free prize draw, download an app or buy tickets, post a comment on our websites, ask us a question, email us or interact with Ticketmaster's call centres.

**From third parties.** For example, if you choose to use an integrated social media feature on our websites or apps, the third-party social media site will give us certain information about you. This could include your name and email address. Your activities on our sites and apps may be posted to the social media platforms. Further information about the third parties from whom we obtain information is available here.

## Information we may hold about you

**Your payment and billing information.** We will hold payment and billing information you provide to us, e.g. credit card number and post code when you buy a ticket, in connection with the handling of your ticket orders. If you've asked us to, we may also store payment and billing information to make it easier for you to buy tickets in future.

**Information you post online.** For example, we hold information you post on our website or on a third-party social media site to which we have access (including reviews you post or surveys you complete). When you post information online, you must not infringe the rights of others (including privacy rights) and you should be aware that others may use, tag and/or re-publish your information in ways that you might not expect (including in ways that are unlawful).

We may also hold information on interests and demographic categories inferred from your interactions with us in order to provide you a better service and to provide you with more focused information.

We may also add information to your details which we have obtained from other companies or sources. For example, we may cross check the accuracy of the information we hold with other databases, or we may add demographic information. Much of this data is created using publicly available sources such as the edited electoral register or a publically available postal address list, or is derived from market research such as consumer panel surveys.
