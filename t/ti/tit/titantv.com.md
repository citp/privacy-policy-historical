**TitanTV.com Privacy Policy (updated May 17, 2012)**

At **Broadcast Interactive Media, LLC (“BIM”) (formerly known as Decisionmark Holdings, Inc.)** , we recognize the importance of privacy to users of TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application. This Privacy Policy explains what type of information may be collected from you when you access TitanTV.com or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application and how that information may be used. Please note that this Privacy Policy pertains only to TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application, and is separate and distinct from the privacy policies, end user license agreements, terms or service, or terms of use governing: (a) YouNews®; (b) the web sites, applications and services of BIM's clients; (c) the web sites, applications and services that may link to or from the TitanTV.com website or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application; and (d) other BIM web sites, applications or services. “TitanTV.com Mobile Application” means the TitanTV.com executable code version of the software provided by BIM, including associated documentation and services, designed to run on some mobile devices.

**Gathering of Information**

BIM may collect personally-identifying information from TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application for a variety of purposes. Such personally identifying information may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, and e-mail address.

BIM may ask you to provide certain personal information when you register for certain features or services included in TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application. BIM also may ask you to provide personal information in other limited circumstances specified at the time the information is gathered. Any information that you submit on or through TitanTV.com or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application may become public.

Like all other Web servers, BIM's Web server may automatically create log files for each user who accesses TitanTV.com or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application. These "access logs" may allow BIM to make TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application more useful to our users. The access logs may record the identifier provided for your mobile device by your wireless carrier ("carrier identifier"). Otherwise, the access logs do NOT record a user's name, address, e-mail address, credit card numbers, or any other personally-identifying information. Rather, they may contain some or all of the following information:

  * The Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) of the device which downloaded, installed or used the Mobile Application.
  * The date of use.
  * The time of use.
  * The path taken through TitanTV.com or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application.
  * The operating system and device type being used.
  * A list of files downloaded or viewed.
  * The amount of time spent listening to/viewing media files.
  * Any errors encountered.
  * The device’s geographic location.



**Cookies and Other Technologies**

BIM may also use 'cookies' to collect information. A cookie is a string of characters that can be written to a file on the user's device when the user accesses TitanTV.com or downloads, installs or uses the TitanTV.com Mobile Application.

BIM uses cookies to track users' activity through TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application in order to improve the site, the application architecture, to offer the features that would not be possible without them, to offer third party content, and to recall specific information to save the user time during subsequent use of TitanTV.com or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application. For example, cookies allow BIM to remember your (and/or your device’s) location. Interactive features may also use cookies. Our sponsorship service vendors, which serve sponsorship messages onto TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application, and third party vendors that measure and analyze the use of TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application for BIM, may also use their own cookies.

BIM and the third party vendors that measure and analyze use of TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application for BIM also may use web beacons, alone or in conjunction with cookies, to help compile information about and facilitate usage of TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application. A web beacon is an electronic image, also known as a single-pixel (1x1) or clear .gif, which can be used to recognize certain information on your device, such as cookies, the time and date of your actions within TitanTV.com or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application, and a description of where content is placed. We may use web beacons on TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application from time to time for this and other purposes.

Excluding information provided by the user, which may become public as discussed above, personally-identifying information collected by BIM may be given to the following third parties:

  * BIM’s clients, suppliers, licensors, advertising partners, and service vendors; and
  * other third parties when you specifically consent to such distribution (such as the disclosure of your name to a friend when you email, send via SMS or text message, or otherwise share a story to that friend).



In these circumstances, the information is provided to a third party for the purposes of

  * delivering TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application and any associated service, advertising, or content to you;
  * delivering communications from BIM or BIM clients, suppliers, licensors, advertising partners or service vendors;

**Third-Party Advertising**

We use several third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you access TitanTV.com or when you download, install or use the TitanTV.com Mobile Application.

**Security**

BIM has in place what we believe to be appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. However, no Internet, e-mail or mobile transmission is ever fully secure or error free and BIM cannot guarantee that any information will be or remain safe or secure. Because most e-mail and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail, SMS or text message, or other mobile transmission.

It is important to note that TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application may contain links to other sites, applications and services maintained by third parties that may not follow the same privacy policies as TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application. For instance, clicking or tapping on a sponsorship notice or some third party logos on TitanTV.com or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application will take you to an entirely different site, application or service. These sites, applications and services may use cookies, collect data, and use the data in ways that TitanTV.com or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application would not. BIM is not responsible for the privacy practices or any information or materials on these other sites, applications and services. Please visit these sites or applications if you wish to review their privacy policies.

In some cases, TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application may include certain embedded tools provided and controlled by third parties and governed by the terms and policies of the third parties. You should only use these third party tools if you agree to their respective terms and policies.

TitanTV.com and the TitanTV.com Mobile Application may include a tool that allows you to sign in using information from your account with a third party service, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, OpenID, or LinkedIn. Please be aware that those third party services are unrelated to BIM, and that your use of the third party services is subject to the terms and policies of those services.

For international users, please note that it may be necessary to transfer your information internationally and, in particular, your information may be transferred to and processed in the United States.

**In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy**

In the event that BIM, TitanTV.com or the TitanTV.com Mobile Application business is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
