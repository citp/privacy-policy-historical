Each time a visitor comes to a Titleseo Web site, we collect some information to improve the overall quality of the online experience. At Titleseo content sites, we collect the visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or yale.edu), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a Titleseo Web site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). The Titleseo site collects visitor information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement and targeted advertising. We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Titleseo properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but Titleseo will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission. When Titleseo does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.

**Use of cookies**

Titleseo Web sites may use cookies for internal reporting. Cookies are a standard Internet technology that allow us to both store and retrieve login information on a user's system.

However, please note that a few of these search engines may send you an auto response, confirming your submission 

**Use of Email Addresses Collected from Newsletter and Mailing List Subscriptions.**

After signing up to receive any of Titleseo Newsletters or mailing lists by email, users will start receiving newsletters or emails delivered on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, as well as occasional product-related announcements. Note that every subscriber will go through a double opt-in process to make sure that no one gets subscribed accidentally. After a subscriber signs up on one of our sign up forms a confirmation email will be sent to the subscriber. The subscriber will only be added to our database when they confirm their subscription by replying to this email. 

On Titleseo Web sites that offer newsletters, we collect subscribers' email addresses in order to distribute those newsletters and product-related announcements. In addition, Titleseo has entered into agreements with a number of other companies to distribute Titleseo newsletters and mailing lists to users on their systems. Titleseo newsletters and mailing lists are also offered in a number of Newsletter Partner sites, all of which require a user's email address for distribution. In the case of those email addresses collected by our Partners, email addresses are either forwarded to us for maintenance by Titleseo, or are kept and maintained exclusively by our Partners under privacy conditions acceptable to Titleseo. If you are concerned about the privacy policies of a Newsletter Partner site, please contact the webmaster of that site.
