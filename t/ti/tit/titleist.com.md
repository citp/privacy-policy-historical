# Titleist: Corporate: Privacy

**ACUSHNET COMPANY PRIVACY POLICY  
**Welcome to www.titleist.com. Titleist wants you to know what information we learn about you when you visit this site, what we do with that information, and how you can change the information we have.

**What Information Is Collected  
**When you visit www.titleist.com, we recognize only your domain name and not your e-mail address. We will see your e-mail address only if you fill out a form or send us an e-mail message. We may also collect information about you if you register on a page, fill out a survey, participate in our contests or if you otherwise voluntarily tell us about yourself or your activities.

**How Information Is Used  
**When you provide information about yourself, we use it to improve our products and services and the content of this site. We may also use it to send you information about our products and services. If you do not want to receive e-mail from us about our products and services, please see the Choice/Opt-out section of our Privacy Policy.

**Cookies  
**Titleist uses cookies to track online activity of Web users. A cookie is a piece of data on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. The cookie was placed by us, or by DoubleClick. With both cookies and transparent GIFs, the information that we collect is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to <http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy>.

**Transparent GIFs  
**Titleist uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage our online advertising and to help us manage our content by informing us what content is effective. Transparent GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. Transparent GIFs are not tied to a user's personally identifiable information.

**Sharing Information  
**Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information if required by law when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. We do not otherwise share information with third parties.

**Choice/Opt-out  
**Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by inputing your e-mail address at: <http://titleist.com/myaccount/unsubscribe.aspx>, modifying your information in your titleist.com registration, or you may contact us at email us at <http://www.titleist.com/customerservice/default.asp>**Use of This Website by Children  
**We understand that some children may choose to visit our website and we encourage those visits. However, we recommend that children check with their parents before entering information on any website and that parents discuss with their children restrictions with respect to the types of personal information that they would prefer not be disclosed.

**Links  
**This Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Security  
**We use reasonable efforts to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, we use reasonable efforts to protect our users' information both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of most Web browsers becomes locked.

When we use software to protect your information online, we also do everything possible to protect your information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (such as billing or shipping) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

**Correcting, Updating or Deleting Personal Information  
**If a user's personally identifiable information changes, or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by logging into your profile at titleist.com registration on the home page or by sending an inquiry to our customer support at <http://www.titleist.com/customerservice/default.asp>**Notification of Changes  
**Titleist reserves the right to change or update this policy at any time by posting a notice to that effect on this site and other places where we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. However, if we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases, where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. **
