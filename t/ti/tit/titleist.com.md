### Links

This Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Site.

### Security

We use reasonable efforts to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Site, we use reasonable efforts to protect our users' information both online and off-line. When our order form asks users to enter credit card numbers, that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our checkout page, the lock icon on the bottom of most Web browsers becomes locked.

When we use software to protect your information online, we also use reasonable efforts to protect your information off-line. Access to our users' information is restricted to employees of our company and its affiliates and agencies who need the information to perform a specific job (such as billing or shipping).

Although we have taken steps to ensure that your personal information is not collected, used, or disclosed except as set forth by this Privacy Policy, technical mistakes are possible. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of electronically stored sensitive personal data via email or by conspicuous posting on the Website as soon as possible to the extent consistent with (a) the legitimate needs of law enforcement and (b) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

### Information Storage and Transfer

Your personal information will be kept in a database held on servers kept in a physically and technologically secure environment located in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, U.S.A. (or, in the case of certain blog sites, may be retained at the relevant service providers’ locations), accessed only by authorized personnel or contractors who are bound to keep your information confidential. We have in place procedures for training our employees about their obligations under this Privacy Policy, disciplining them for failure to follow this Policy. We also have in place internal procedures to confirm general company compliance with this Policy.

Your information will be transferred to Acushnet Company, Fairhaven, Massachusetts, United States of America, which location may be outside of your own country, and by providing us with your information, you are consenting to such transfer.

This can be done by logging into your profile at this Site’s registration on the home page or by our customer support at 1-800-225-8500. If you request that we delete your personally identifiable information or deactivate your account we may retain aggregate information developed from your personal information.

### Notification of Changes

We reserve the right to change or update this policy at any time by posting a notice to that effect on this Site and other places where we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. However, if we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the Site, or deleted their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Site notifying users of the change. In some cases, where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. Your continued use of this Site constitutes your consent to these changes.
