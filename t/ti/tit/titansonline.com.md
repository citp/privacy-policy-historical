 **1.         Types of Information That May Be Collected**

The following are the types of information we may collect:

 **            a.        Information We Collect About You**:

We collect information about your use of our Services, including but not limited to your Internet connections, computer equipment, web browsers, sites visited before using or accessing our Website, sites visited after leaving our Website, and other similar information about traffic and usage, as you navigate to, through, and away from our Website. This is called “Non-Personal Data” because it does not identify you, but provides insights to us regarding your use of the Services.

As with many websites, our Website uses a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie does not actually identify you, but rather only the computer that is used to visit the Website. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Website whenever your computer is used to visit the Website. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our Website and where visitors go on the Website. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being used to access the Website. For registered users, cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Website, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Website. Cookies may also allow the Website to present to you advertising, which may be of interest to you. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. Cookies on the Website are not tied to the users personal information.

Log Data refers to certain information about how a user uses our Services. Log Data may include information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the pages or features of our Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a user clicked on, and other statistics.

You may be given the option to receive push notifications while using our Services. In order to serve push notifications, we may need to collect your IP address and a persistent identifier from your device. You can turn off push notifications in your device settings.

 **            b.        Information You Provide Us:** In the course of using the Website, we may ask you to provide us with certain information, including contact information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, payment information, unique identifiers, such as your user ID and user password, and demographic information, such as your date of birth, age or gender. This type of data is called “Personal Data” because it can be used to identify you. When other information, such as a favorite team or player, is associated with personal information, it also becomes Personal Data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

Collectively in this Privacy Policy, Personal Data and Non-Personal Data is referenced as “Data.”

 _IP Addresses_ : We may receive and store certain types of Internet usage information whenever you visit the Website, such as your IP address and click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with Personal Data. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request web pages from the Website. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Website, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.

In some jurisdictions, such as the United States, an IP address may be considered Non-Personal Data. In the EEA, for example, an IP address is considered Personal Data under applicable data protection laws. If this is the case, we process Non-Personal Data for the same purposes as Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.

 _Payment Information_ : If you conduct a financial transaction with our Website, such as ordering merchandise from our online pro shop, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information. We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the information, products or other services that you order, and to invoice you. For your protection, such information is collected through encrypted means.

 _Emails from Us_ : When you open emails from us, we may receive a confirmation noting you opened the email, if your computer supports such capabilities. We also may keep track of what emails we send you and what emails you may be receiving from our subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, we keep a record of what communications you have opted to receive or not to receive.

 _Geolocation Data_ : You may choose to allow us to access your location by granting the Website access to your location when prompted or through your device’s location services settings. You may change these settings on your device. When you download the App and install it on your mobile device(s) and/or associated computing device, you acknowledge that the App will access the Global Positioning Systems (“GPS”) functionality within your mobile device, and the App will subsequently share that GPS information with your associated computing device and with our cloud-based software and systems. This geolocation data collection and subsequent sharing of GPS information enables the core functionality of the App, and without receiving geolocation data from your mobile device, the App will not perform correctly.

 _Third-Party Social Networking Services_ : Additionally, if you choose to access, visit, and/or use any third-party social networking service(s) that may be integrated with our Services, we may receive your Personal Data and other information about you and your computer, mobile, or other device that you have made available to those social networking services, including information about your contacts on those services. For example, some social networking services allow you to push content from our Service to your contacts or to pull information about your contacts so you can connect with them on or through our Service. Some social networking services also will facilitate your registration for our Service, enter our contests or sweepstakes, or enhance or personalize your experience on our Service. Your decision to use a social networking service in connection with our Service is voluntary. However, you should make sure you are comfortable with the information your third-party social networking services may make available to our Service by visiting those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those services.

 **2.         How Information May Be Collected**

We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Website, including but not limited to those described below:

 _Registration_ : You may be asked to complete a registration form and provide Personal Data; you may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Website may choose to offer, such as newsletters or contests, fan voting, season ticket waiting list forms, donation request forms, or merchandise catalog requests. Participation in registration is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.

 _Newsletters and Website Emails_ : We offer free newsletters to share information with you about the Website, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, or about our marketing partners and advertisers and sponsors. You may receive a newsletter either by registering for a particular newsletter or in conjunction with a special feature or membership for which you have registered on the Website. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. You may also cancel your free email subscription by following the instructions provided on the Website or in the newsletter or email by [clicking here](https://www.titansonline.com/fans/email-newsletter).

 _Tell-A-Friend_ : If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Tennessee Football, Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Your friend may contact us at websitefanfeedback@titans.nfl.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

 _Contests or Sweepstakes_ : We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration or the submission of Personal Data. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website. Your Personal Data may be used to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other purposes (see the rules of each contest for details about how your personal information will be used). We may also ask your permission to allow us to publicly post some of your information on the Website or our social media accounts, such as on a winner’s page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. Except as required by applicable law, we will not post your information without your permission. In some instances, a third party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Website, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we do not collect your information and we have no control over the information collected from you. Accordingly, we urge you to review the advertiser’s or sponsor’s Privacy Policy and rules applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.

 _Surveys or Voting_ : From time-to-time we may request Personal Data from you in conjunction with a survey or voting poll. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information to the Website.

 _Games_ : When you register to play games on our Website, you may be asked to provide Personal Data.

If you provide Personal Data through our Services, we may aggregate that Data with other active Data, unless we specify otherwise at the point of collection.

 **4.         With Whom Information May Be Shared**

At times, we may share your Personal Data with others for various purposes. The following outlines the ways in which your information may be shared with others and the ways in which you may opt-out of having your Data shared:

 _Agents and Third-Party Providers_ : We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Website analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to Personal Data needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products.

 _Third-Party Offers_ : Throughout the Website, you may be presented with opportunities to receive special offers from third parties. By participating in these offers, you consent to allowing your Data to be shared with third parties. When you allow us to share your Personal Data with third parties, we require third parties who have access to that information to agree to abide by our current Website Privacy Policy. We cannot control the privacy practices of these other companies, however, and you should review the privacy practices of such companies prior to providing your Personal Data.

Users who sign up for information on third-party websites are submitting their information directly to a third-party, even though the pages may have the same look and feel as the our official team Website. The use of your Data by an authorized third party is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. Please play close attention to each third party’s respective privacy policy, which pertains only to its unique site.

 _Opt-In / Opt-Out Offers_ : When you provide us with Personal Data, you may be presented with the opportunity to share your Personal Data with third parties for various purposes, such as receiving information or special offers. An opt-in/opt-out message will ask you if you would like your Data to be shared. When you allow us to share your Personal Data with third parties, we require third parties who have access to that information to agree to abide by our current Website Privacy Policy. Once the information is transferred, however, we cannot control the privacy practices of these other companies.

 _Contests / Sweepstakes_ : We periodically operate contests and sweepstakes through the Website that may require registration or the submission of Personal Data. By participating in these contests and sweepstakes, which are voluntary, you consent to allowing your Data to be shared with third parties (see the rules for each contest or sweepstakes for details about how your personal information will be used). We cannot control the privacy practices of these other companies, however, and you should review the privacy practices of such companies prior to providing your Personal Data.

 _Other Promotional Offers_ : We may send offers to you on behalf of our marketing partners. When we do this, we do not give that partner your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, you may use the opt out method detailed in the e-mail or change your preferences by logging into your account.

 _Affiliates_ : We may share your Data with corporate affiliates, including corporate parents, subsidiaries, other affiliated entities, and associated entities for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, which are required to treat the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

 _Aggregate Information_ : We may share aggregate Data, such as demographics and Website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors, or other organizations. When this type of Data is shared, the other parties do not have access to your Personal Data.

 _Business Transfers_ : In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your Personal Data is one of the business assets transferred, all Personal Data that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer, in which case we will require the recipient to use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

 _Administrative or Legal Process_ : Your Data may be transferred as we believe necessary: (i) under applicable law; (ii) to enforce applicable terms and conditions; (iii) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; (iv) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (v) to respond to claims that contact information (e.g. name, e-mail address, etc.) of a third-party has been posted or transmitted without their consent or as a form of harassment and (vi) to respond to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include authorities outside your country of residence;

Finally, your Data may be shared pursuant to your explicit approval prior to the disclosure.

 _A Note about Third-Party Tracking and Our Website:_ When you use the Internet, unaffiliated parties such as ad networks, web analytics companies, and social networking platforms may collect information about your online activities over time and across our and other websites. This information may be used to provide advertisements for products and services that may interest you, and those companies may use cookies, clear GIFs, and other tracking technologies. We do not track your activity across different websites or online services. It is possible we may not honor “do not track” signals transmitted by web browsers _._

For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, visit the NAI’s consumer website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/. If you do want to opt out using these tools, you need to opt out separately for each of your devices and for each web browser (such as Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari) that you use on each device.

 **5.         Chat Rooms, Forums, And Message Boards**

The Website may make chat rooms, forums and message boards available to its users. You are not required to provide any Personal Data when using these areas but you may choose to do so. If you post Personal Data online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public in a chat room, forum, or message board. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose Personal Data in these areas.

 **6.         Security**

This Website incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy, and privacy of the Data that we may collect and we have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse, and alteration. Your Personal Data is transferred to our computers utilizing encryption software. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to do their jobs are allowed access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required.

Nonetheless, it is common knowledge that transmission of information via the Internet is not wholly secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data, or any other information, transmitted to or through any of our Service(s). Any transmission of Personal Data, or other information, is at your own risk. By using our Service(s), you acknowledge and accept these risks. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us or that are otherwise provided to us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of information. It is your responsibility to safeguard any passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features associated with your use of the Service(s). Any transmission of information is at your own risk. By using our Service(s), you acknowledge and accept these risks.

 _Right to Rectify — Correction and Deletion_. Citizens of some jurisdictions, including the EEA, have the right to correct or amend their Personal Data if it is inaccurate or requires updating.  You may also have the right to request deletion of your Personal Data; however, this is not always possible due to legal requirements and other obligations and factors. Remember that you can update your account information by contacting us at websitefanfeedback@titans.nfl.com.
