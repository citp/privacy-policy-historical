Tip Hero processes personal information on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide our own services. In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.  
When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use.

If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other purposes. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Tip Hero may not be able to provide those services to you.

We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. We provide such information to companies affiliated with Tip Hero, as well as other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

Access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is necessary in order to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. It is also necessary to enforce applicable Terms of Use, as well as to investigate any potential violations and abuses of the Terms of Use. In addition, we may need to use this information to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. Finally, we use this information to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Tip Hero, its users, and the public as required or permitted by law.  
If Tip Hero becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will make every reasonable effort to provide notice of such a change before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We may, from time-to-time, share with third parties certain pieces of personal information in the aggregate. For example, we may share information related to the number of website visitors who searched for a particular event or clicked on a particular website. Such information does not identify you individually.

We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.  
We restrict access to personal information to Tip Hero employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Tip Hero processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

When you use Tip Hero, we make every reasonable effort to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.

Tip Hero regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy and/or Tip Hero’s treatment of personal information by writing to us either via email or at Privacy Matters, c/o Tipedia LLC, 195 Harvard Street, Suite 200, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139, USA.
