## PRIVACY POLICY

Last update on: 25/05/2018

At Tipeee.com ("Tipeee"), we undertake to protect your privacy. All our team members are, like you, Internet users and customers of other web sites, and fully understand the importance of respecting privacy on the Internet.

This "Privacy Policy" describes the terms and conditions under which TIPEEE collects and processes the personal data of the users of the platform Tipeee.com. 

### Preamble

\- Tipeee SAS develops and operates the platform "Tipeee.com" dedicated to crowd funding for content creators on the Internet.

\- The platform connects "Creators", who create pages of support on the website, and "Tippers", who wish to support these Creators financially by paying them in particular financial contributions known as "Tips". In the course of these activities, we are involved in processing your personal data, whether you are a simple visitor or a member.

\- In order to respect your privacy and ensure the protection of your data, we comply with the privacy protection regulations in force, including the French Law no. 78-17 dated January 6th 1978, in particular the Law on "Computer Technology and Freedom " and the European Regulation 2016/679 dated April 27th 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, referred to as the "General Data Protection Regulation" or "GDPR".

\- We may be led to update this Privacy Policy. Any relevant update shall be previously made known to you and, when it is necessary, it shall be subject to collection of your prior consent.

\- Our data protection officer can be contacted at [dpo@tipeee.com](mailto:dpo@tipeee.com) or through the postal system: TIPEEE SAS, Protection des données, 20 rue du Sentier, 75002 Paris, FRANCE.

### What personal data do we collect and process?

In our capacity as a data controller, we collect and process some of your personal data.

We collect this data, in your capacity as a user of our platform in order to identify you and to contact you (username, full name, email address, postal address, phone), to validate the setting on line of your Creator page (explanatory contents of the Creator pages, Counterparties content, etc.) and to organise the collection of the Tips (banking information).

Furthermore, we collect data related to your use of our services, as well as the browsing data on our websites and our dedicated pages on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). The collected data are necessary to generate audience statistics, to measure the performance, and to carry out business development.

We collect data related to your exchanges with us regarding our services, and the requests that you are presenting to us, especially regarding the management of your rights as well as your instructions in the event of death.

We collect finally the data allowing us to comply with our obligations in the area of combating tax fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as for the management of your rights, pre-litigations and litigations. Within this framework, we need to collect documents in particular proving your identity (National ID card, Passport, Driving licence, etc.).

All of this information can be communicated to us when you fill out our online forms or within our exchanges. These data can also be collected through software technologies such as cookies. For more information on our use of these tools, we invite you to review the cookie policy available at the following address: [Cookies policy](https://web.archive.org/cookies).

### Concerning the sensitive data

Some data (whether optional or mandatory) that you record via our online forms becomes public and are accessible to everyone. By recording this data, you could reveal your personal data, sometimes sensitive or very personal (religious or philosophical convictions, sexual orientation, political opinions, health status, etc.). **Therefore, and as a precaution, we suggest to be careful** when entering information in order to protect your privacy.

\- _Sensitive data accessible from your member profile_ (when you have created your Tipeee account): username, avatar (graphic illustration), internal messages sent from the website;

\- _Sensitive data accessible from your Creator page_ (when you created a Creator page and decided to publish it by activating it): the Creator name, social networks and websites, the Creator page description (including texts, graphic illustrations or any other type of content), counterparties, objectives;

\- _Sensitive data available in the "News" and "Comments" sections of the Creator page_ (when the Creator posts a News, when comments are sent via the forms available in the "News" and "Comments" tabs or via the form during the financial subscription): The news title and content (including text, graphic illustrations or any other type of content), content of a comment or answer to a comment. 

For your information, when you send a Tip to a Creator, you can decide whether or not to post publicly the comment you make to the Creator when you support him/her financially; 

\- _Sensitive data when sending a financial contribution to a Creator_ \- by default, the Tips (financial contribution) are public and visible from the Tips list on your member profile. Sometimes, the fact to support a Creator may reveal sensitive or very personal data. For example, by supporting a Creator with a political dimension, you indirectly reveal your political opinion. If you would not like your Tip to be public, Tipeee allows you to set your Tip as "anonymous" To do this, you will need to access the administration of your account (in Preferences & notifications). Your identity shall be only known to Tipeee as well as the Creator to whom you sent a Tip.

### Concerning the third parties data

By writing a presentation of a Creator page or a News, you may be required to enter information about third parties (your partners, people you know, etc.).

The data processing shall be carried out in accordance with the regulations.

**You should check that you have the right to communicate** such data to Tipeee and to the public (for example by having the written consent of such third parties) and to provide them with the information on the data processing carried out by Tipeee included in this Privacy Policy.

### What are the purposes and legal basis for processing the personal data?

In accordance with the regulations, any processing of personal data shall - in order to be lawful - be based on one of the legal basis set out in Article 6, or Article 9.2 of the GDPR if it related to the said sensitive data.

The table below presents the different objectives to be pursued within processing of your personal data and the legal basis for each objective.

Managing the Tips and Funds Transfers  | Performance of the contracts concluded with the Tippers and the Creators

The legitimate interests of Tipeee (contribution management) and compliance with its legal obligations by virtue of the legislation (reporting of contributions)

As part of its legal obligations to combat fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing, TIPEEE and its payment providers carry out data processing, including data combinations, in order to help their partners to determine the level of fraud risk associated with a payment or fundraising. These processing can be used as a justification of the decision of TIPEEE or its service providers to reject a payment or the release of funds.
