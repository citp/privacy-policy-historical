### 1\. Information Collection

Personally Identifiable Information.

This information may include bank account information, personal identification, IP addresses, email addresses and other information required to complete the services rendered to our customers. In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used to execute payments to our customers, respond to requests that they make, to process transactions, to facilitate a request for a quote from a third party service provider or to aid us in serving you better.

When you use a widget or any other tool offered by us, whether on the Site or on a third party website, including a website owned or operated by you, we may record data related to that activity, the deployment of the widget or tool and any other account related data.

Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.

We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed.

Third Party Sites

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. The Site may include links and references to the websites of others or third party advertises. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information that you submit. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and other terms of the other websites. We do not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to such websites.
