Yes. TigerNet asks for your name, e-mail address, and other limited personal information when you sign up as a member and use features such as chat and the message board.

TigerNet will use registration information to let you know about new features or other offers of interest from TigerNet, or to address customer service needs and requests. In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. TigerNet does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal information you provide us to these advertisers. Advertisers simply provide an insertion order for the advertising message and TigerNet then displays the ad to appropriate users based on the criteria specified in the order.
