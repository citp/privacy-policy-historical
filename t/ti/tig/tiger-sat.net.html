<p>Please be aware that Sling Television Group is not responsible for the data collection, use, disclosure and storage practices (or any action or omission) of companies or organizations to which our website may provide links. Some links are provided by us in connection with our efforts to provide you with comprehensive information on our Services and the information practices described herein.
