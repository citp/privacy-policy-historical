### Cookies and Website Analytics

To improve your experience on our site, we may use “cookies”. Cookies are an industry standard and most major web sites use them.

You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. 

Cookies are used for two particular purposes on our site: (1) to enable Google Analytics, and (2) to remember that you were informed about cookies on our website, so that we would not have to show cookie-related warnings repeatedly, each time you open any of our webpages. 

Google Analytics is a service which allows us to analyse usage of our website. It transmits website traffic statistics to Google servers. Google Analytics does not identify individual users or associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. We use reports provided by Google Analytics to understand website traffic and webpage usage. Google Analytics cannot work without using cookies.

### Social Media

If you share our content through social media, for example by liking us on Facebook, following or tweeting about us on Twitter, or giving us a “+1” via Google Plus, those social networks will record that you have done so and may set a cookie for this purpose. 

In some cases, where a page on our website includes content from a social network, such as a Twitter feed, or Facebook comments box, those services may set a cookie even where you do not click a button. As is the case for all cookies, we cannot access those set by social networks, just as those social networks cannot access cookies we set ourselves. 

### Log Files

This information is removed automatically after fixed period of time (not exceeding two months) as specified in the configuration of the web server software used to host our website.
