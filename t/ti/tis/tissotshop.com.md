**Cookies**

Like many companies, we use "cookies" on this website. Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer's hard drive when you visit certain websites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site. We use cookies, for example, to preserve the contents of your virtual shopping cart between visits. We also use cookies to measure activity on the website and determine which areas and features of the website are the most popular. Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie and how to disable existing cookies. Without cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our website features. For example, if you turn off cookies or refuse them, you will not be able to make purchases on the website. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, you can place your order by calling 1-866-462-0050, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 9AM and 5PM EST, excluding holidays.

**Web Beacons**

Certain pages on this website contain "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). Web beacons are used for internal purposes, such as to obtain the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, and the type of browser used to view the page. We also retain service providers who use web beacons to assess the effectiveness of our email communications and learn what pages our visitors viewed.

**Third-Party Use Of Cookies And Other Technologies**

Tissot also may allow reputable third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies so that these third parties can provide services to us. These selected companies may use information about your activities on our website and other websites and combine such information with other information (such as an email address) to provide advertisements about our products and services on this and other websites. These third parties have their own policies regarding privacy, and their information practices are not covered by this Privacy Statement. Some of these third parties are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), a cooperative of online marketing companies that offers a centralized tool for opting out of behavioral advertising delivered by each of its member companies. We encourage you to read these businesses' privacy policies if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your personal information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer Web site located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/. Please note that opting out of the use of your information by an NAI member company does not mean that you will no longer receive online advertising or that data about your activities on our website will not be collected by third parties. It does mean that a NAI member company from which you opted out will no longer deliver advertisements tailored to your online activities as long as the company's opt-out cookie resides on your browser. You also may configure your browser settings to reject all third-party cookies.

**Transmit and Transfer of Personal Information to Other Countries**

If you are unsure whether this Privacy Statement is in conflict with the applicable local rules where you are located, you should not submit your or any other persons personally identifiably information to us. Anyone who accesses, uses or interacts with us, our third party providers or this website who submits personally identifiably information or provides any other information does thereby affirmatively consent to: (i) the international transmission, transfer, processing and/or storage of all such information, including personally identifiably information, to a country which may be deemed to have inadequate data protection and (ii) the collection (including by automated means through cookies and Web beacons), transmission, using, sharing and storage of such information, including personally identifiably information, as provided in this Privacy Statement.

**Phishing**

 "Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email.

**Visiting TISSOTSHOP.COM From Third-Party Sites**
