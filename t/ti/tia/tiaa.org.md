Your browsing and interaction on any other web site is subject to the rules and policies of that site. We encourage you to read the rules and policies of the sites you visit to further understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.

### How your information is used

We use your personal information primarily to provide you with the products and services you request, and we share and use your personal information relating to transactions, balances, payment history and similar experiences among the TIAA Companies to conduct their business. Unless you have told us otherwise, pursuant to “Your right to opt out” below, we may also use your personal information to market or determine your possible interest in products and services that the other TIAA Companies offer. If you are a participant in an employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan investing in a TIAA or third-party annuity contract or a TIAA or third-party mutual fund, we may share the information we collect with your employer and its agents, if any, for plan administration purposes.

### Disclosure of your information

We share your personal information with other TIAA Companies as permitted by law. We will not disclose your personal information to anyone outside of the TIAA Companies unless: 1) we have received proper consent from you; 2) we are legally permitted to do so; or 3) we reasonably believe, in good faith, that we are legally required to do so. For example, we may provide the information to assist us with various aspects of conducting our business, to comply with laws or industry regulations, and/or to effectuate any action that you have requested, including the following:

  * Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., fulfillment companies and securities clearinghouses, data processing services, printers and mailing facilities) engaged by us
  * Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., third-party administrators) engaged by your employer
  * Unaffiliated fund and/or insurance companies and their agents whose investment options are made available to you through your employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan, provided monies are allocated to them on your behalf
  * Government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials (e.g., for tax purposes or for reporting suspicious transactions)
  * Other organizations, with your consent or as directed by you (e.g., if you use TIAA as a financial reference in applying for credit with another institution)
  * Other organizations, as permitted or required by law (e.g., for fraud prevention)

### Your right to opt out

Providing us with access to your information permits us to offer you distinct advantages and better service. It enables us to provide you with more comprehensive financial guidance. Sharing and using your information helps us tailor product offerings to you and eliminate those that may not interest you. This helps us keep expenses low.

Federal law gives you the right to limit some but not all sharing of your personal information. You may not limit sharing of information of your transactions and experiences with TIAA Companies, but you may limit sharing of information about your creditworthiness.

**Unless you tell us otherwise and opt out** , (i) the TIAA Company(ies) with which you have a business relationship may share information about your creditworthiness with other TIAA Companies or (ii) other TIAA Companies may use your personal information for marketing purposes.

If you opt out, the TIAA Company(ies) with which you have a business relationship will still notify you of their new products or services. Please note that we cannot withdraw any previous disclosures made with your authorization.

If you own a life insurance contract, brokerage account or a TIAA-CREF Funds account with a co-owner, you and the co-owner may:  
 

  * Opt out separately, or
  * Either of you may opt out for both of you



If you opt out separately, we will limit disclosure of information only for the owner who has opted out. If you indicate that you are opting out for the co-owner as well, we will limit disclosure for both of you.

Your opt-out becomes effective as soon as practicable. It remains in effect until you revoke it in writing.  Even if you have opted out, you will receive our privacy notice as required by law.
