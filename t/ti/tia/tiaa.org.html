that we take very seriously at TIAA-CREF. We assure you
that we will not sell or barter your personal information
or our mailing lists to any person or organization.</b>
You have entrusted us with an important role in your
financial future and we are committed to keeping your
personal information secure. We are also committed
to the principles stated in this notice whether you are
a current, prospective or former customer.</p>
<p>Please read this notice carefully. It will provide you
with information about the TIAA-CREF companies'
policy and procedures with respect to your personal
information in accordance with the Fair Credit
Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Financial Services Modernization Act (GLB). The
"TIAA-CREF companies" are described in this notice.
A <a href="privacy_notice.html">separate notice</a> describing additional privacy practices
related to health information is provided to our
Long Term Care Insurance customers, and should be
read together with this notice by those customers.
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="606060">Information We May Collect<br>
              </font></b>We may collect nonpublic personal information about you from various sources. For example, a TIAA-CREF
company may collect:
</p>
<ul>
<li> information you provide on applications and forms or during consultations, or that may
be necessary to complete your requested transaction;</li><br>
              <li> information pertaining to your relationship with other TIAA-CREF companies, such as your 
ownership of their products;</li>
              <br>
<li> information from consumer reporting agencies, such as marital status, income, size of household,
credit score or credit history, open lines of credit, and employment history; and</li><br>
<li> health information for those applying for or owning a long-term care or life insurance policy. At no time do we disclose your
health information to any other TIAA-CREF company or other person unless authorized by you or required by law.</li><br>
</ul>
            <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="606060">How Your Information Is Used<br>
              </font></b>Your personal information is used primarily to provide you with products and services you request. It also may
be used to determine your possible interest in products and services the TIAA-CREF companies offer. If you are a
participant in an employer-sponsored pension plan which is funded with a TIAA-CREF annuity contract, your plan
account information also is available to your employer for plan administrative purposes.
</p>
<p>
We limit access to your personal information to those TIAA-CREF employees who need to know that information 
to provide products or services to you or for conducting the business of the TIAA-CREF companies. Further,
your personal information is protected by physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in accordance with federal
and state standards, including strict personnel policies, procedures for access and use of electronic data, and 
automated telephone system authentication procedures.
            </p><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="606060">Disclosure Of Your Information<br>
              </font></b>We do not disclose your personal information to anyone outside of the TIAA-CREF companies unless we have
received proper authorization from you or we are permitted or required by law to do so. For example, we may
use independent service providers to mail account statements, product information, or materials that you
request. In order to protect your privacy, our service providers are subject to strict confidentiality, limited use,
and nondisclosure agreements with respect to the personal information that is provided to them for these purposes.
</p>
<p>
Providing the TIAA-CREF companies with access to your information can offer you distinct advantages and
better service because it would enable us to provide you with more comprehensive financial guidance. In fact, we
have established different TIAA-CREF companies to offer you various types of financial products and services.
Using your information helps us tailor product offerings, eliminating those that may not interest you, and helps us
keep expenses low by minimizing duplication. However, if you do not want other TIAA-CREF companies to use
your personal financial information this way, you may simply let us know by opting out.
            </p><p>
Therefore, <b>unless you tell us otherwise,</b> any of the
TIAA-CREF companies may access your nonpublic
personal financial information from records the other
TIAA-CREF companies maintain, including:
</p><ul>
	<li>
information we obtain from your application,
or otherwise obtain to complete your requested
transaction, such as your age, marital status,
beneficiaries, assets, income, Social Security
number, and employer; and
	</li>
	<li>
	information we obtain from a consumer report,
such as credit data, age, income, and marital
status.
	</li>
</ul>
If you opt out, the information about you described
above will not be used by any other TIAA-CREF
company to notify you about new products, services,
or enhancements. We may, however, disclose your
personal financial information to other TIAA-CREF
companies as permitted by law.
			<p></p>
	            <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="606060">Your Right to Opt Out<br>
              </font></b>If you opt out, your information will not be available to other TIAA-CREF companies. 
			  To opt out, please call the <b>ATS Service Center at 877 518-9161.</b></p>
            <p>
If you own a life insurance policy or are a TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds shareholder  with a co-owner, you and the co-owner 
may opt out separately or either of you may opt out for both of you. We will only limit disclosure of your
information and not the co-owner's information, unless you indicate that you also are opting out for the co-owner
or the co-owner calls us.
            </p><p>
You may receive more than one privacy notice from
the TIAA-CREF companies depending on the products
you own. To opt out, you need to call only once. Your
opt out will apply to each of the TIAA-CREF companies.
Your opt out becomes effective as soon as practicable
and remains in effect until you revoke it in writing.
Even if you have opted out, you will receive our
Privacy Policy every year as required by law. However,
if you previously opted out and have not revoked your
opt out by writing to us, your opt out remains in effect
and no further action is necessary.</p>            
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="606060">Changes In Our Privacy Policy<br>
              </font></b>TIAA-CREF periodically reviews its policies and reserves the right to amend them. If we amend our privacy policy, 
we will continue our commitment to keeping your personal information secure and will notify you of any
changes before they become effective.
