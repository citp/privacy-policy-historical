## How Your Information Is Used

We use your personal information primarily to provide you with products and services you request, and to conduct the business of the TIAA-CREF companies. As permitted by law, we may also share your personal information with select partners with whom we have joint marketing agreements in order to provide you with a variety of products and services. We require these companies to meet strict privacy standards described below. We may also use your personal information to determine your possible interest in products and services that the other TIAA-CREF companies offer. If you are a participant in an employer-sponsored pension plan that is funded with a TIAA-CREF annuity contract, we may share the information we collect with your employer for plan administration purposes. 

## Disclosure of Your Information

We may share your personal information with other TIAA-CREF companies. We will not disclose your personal information to anyone outside of the TIAA-CREF companies unless: 1) we have received proper consent from you; 2) we are legally permitted to do so; or 3) we reasonable believe, in good faith, that we are legally required to do so. In order to protect the confidentiality of your personal information, including personal information that we have disclosed to a third party pursuant to this Privacy Policy, we take all appropriate measures, including requiring each third party to execute an appropriate confidentiality agreement governing the use of such information and only allowing access to the information for a limited purpose.

  * Government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials (e.g., for tax purposes or for reporting suspicious transactions); 
  * Other organizations, with your consent or as directed by you (e.g., if you use TIAA-CREF as a financial reference in applying for credit with another institution); and 
  * Other organizations, as permitted or required by law (e.g., for fraud prevention). 



We require that third parties with which we share your personal information protect such information by utilizing the same privacy and security safeguards as those used by TIAA-CREF.

In fact, we have established different TIAA-CREF companies to offer you various types of financial products and services. Using your information helps us tailor product offerings to you and eliminate those that may not interest you. This helps us keep expenses low. Unless you tell us otherwise, any TIAA-CREF company may use your nonpublic personal information from records maintained by one of the other TIAA-CREF companies for marketing purposes. 

However, if you do not want other TIAA-CREF companies to use your personal financial information this way, you may simply let us know by opting out.
