TIAA or the "TIAA companies" are described in this notice.

### Information we may collect

The nonpublic personal information we collect may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, Social Security number, date of birth and your transaction and experience history with TIAA companies.  We may use this information in connection with certain aspects of our business.  For example, we may use this information to complete your requested transaction or to otherwise manage your relationship with the TIAA companies.

### Cookies

When you visit our site, we may collect information about your use of our site through "cookies".

In addition, we capture the paths taken as you move from page to page (i.e., your "click stream" activity). This information allows us to enhance your experience while on our site.

Finally, we use "cookies" to establish and maintain a logged-in connection while you are in the secure section(s) of our website. For example, when you visit your account, perform transactions, update contact information or perform other activity the "cookie" allows you to navigate from page to page in a secure fashion without having to repeatedly log-in.

Browsing to other sites:  
When you use a link to go from **TIAA.org** to another web site, the TIAA Online Privacy Notice is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other web site is subject to the rules and policies of that site. We encourage you to read the rules and policies of the sites you visit to further understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.

### How your information is used

We use your personal information primarily to provide you with the products and services you request, and we share and use your personal information relating to transactions, balances, payment history and similar experiences among the TIAA  companies to conduct their business. As permitted by law, we may also share your personal information with select partners with whom we have joint marketing agreements in order to provide you with a variety of products and services. We require these companies to meet privacy standards described below. Unless you have told us otherwise pursuant to “Your Right To Opt Out” below, we may also use your personal information to market or determine your possible interest in products and services that the other TIAA companies offer. If you are a participant in an employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan investing in a TIAA or third-party annuity contract or a TIAA or third-party mutual fund, we may share the information we collect with your employer and its agents, if any, for plan administration purposes.

### Disclosure of your information

We share your personal information with other TIAA companies as permitted by law. We will not disclose your personal information to anyone outside of the TIAA companies unless: 1) we have received proper consent from you; 2) we are legally permitted to do so; or 3) we reasonably believe, in good faith, that we are legally required to do so. In order to protect the confidentiality of your personal information, including personal information that we have disclosed to a third party pursuant to this Privacy Notice, we take appropriate measures, including requiring each third party to execute an appropriate confidentiality agreement governing the use of such information and only allowing access to the information for a limited purpose. For example, we may provide the information to assist us with various aspects of conducting our business, to comply with laws or industry regulations, and/or to effectuate any contract on your behalf, including the following:

  * Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., fulfillment companies and securities clearinghouses, data processing services, printers and mailing facilities) engaged by us;
  * Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., third-party administrators) engaged by your employer;
  * Unaffiliated fund and/or insurance companies and their agents whose investment options are made available to you through your employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan, provided monies are allocated to them on your behalf;
  * Government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials (e.g., for tax purposes or for reporting suspicious transactions);
  * Other organizations, with your consent or as directed by you (e.g., if you use TIAA as a financial reference in applying for credit with another institution); and
  * Other organizations, as permitted or required by law (e.g., for fraud prevention).



We require that third parties with which we share your personal information protect such information by using the privacy and security safeguards required by law.

### Security of your information

TIAA protects the personal information you provide against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, loss, or misuse. Your personal information is protected by physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in accordance with federal and state standards. These safeguards include appropriate procedures for access and use of electronic data, provisions for the secure transmission of sensitive personal information on our website, and telephone system authentication procedures. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those TIAA employees and agents who need your personal information in order to offer and provide products or services to you.

### Your right to opt out

Providing us with access to your information permits us to offer you distinct advantages and better service. It enables us to provide you with more comprehensive financial guidance. In fact, we have established different TIAA companies to offer you various types of financial products and services. Sharing and using your information helps us tailor product offerings to you and eliminate those that may not interest you. This helps us keep expenses low.

Federal law gives you the right to limit some but not all sharing of your personal information. You may not limit sharing of information of your transactions and experiences with TIAA companies, but you may limit sharing of information about your creditworthiness.

 **Unless you tell us otherwise** , (i) the TIAA company(ies) with which you have a business relationship may share information about your creditworthiness with other TIAA companies or (ii) other TIAA companies may use your personal information for marketing purposes. If you are a Vermont resident, state law gives you an additional right: we will not share information about your creditworthiness with other TIAA companies except with your consent.

If you do not want the TIAA company(ies) with which you have a business relationship to share information about your creditworthiness with other TIAA companies or other TIAA companies to use your personal financial information for marketing purposes, you may simply let us know by opting out. If you opt out, the TIAA company(ies) with which you have a business relationship may still notify you of their new products or services. Please note that we cannot withdraw any previous disclosures made with your authorization.

 **To opt out** of either information sharing or marketing, or both, please call the National Contact Center weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 10 p.m., and on Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., (ET) at 877-518-9161.You may receive more than one privacy notice from the TIAA companies depending on the products you own. If you own a life insurance contract, brokerage account or a TIAA-CREF Funds account with a co-owner, you and the co-owner may:

  * opt out separately; or
  * either of you may opt out for both of you.



If you opt out separately, we will limit disclosure of information only for the owner who has opted out. If you indicate that you are opting out for the co-owner as well, we will limit disclosure for both of you.

Your opt-out becomes effective as soon as practicable. It remains in effect until you revoke it in writing. No further action is needed. Even if you have opted out, you will receive our privacy notice each year as required by law.
