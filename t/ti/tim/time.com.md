[Canada Privacy Information](https://subscription.timeinc.com/storefront/privacy/time/generic_privacy_new_caneu.html?dnp-source=E)  
The Canada Privacy Policy applies to you if you live in [Canada](https://subscription.timeinc.com/storefront/privacy/time/generic_privacy_new_caneu.html?dnp-source=E).

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes how TIME USA LLC and its affiliates or subsidiaries (“Time,” “we,” or “our”) collect, use, and disclose information when you interact with Time, including our owned and operated websites (<https://time.com/>), mobile apps, email newsletters, online subscriptions, other product offerings, and any other services that display this Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as the “Services”). This Privacy Policy also applies to any offline data collection, such as the contact information you provide to create or update your print subscriptions.

In this Policy, “personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual.

Individuals from different countries or jurisdictions may have different rights with respect to their personal information. We reserve the ability to limit our response to any request to exercise your rights based on the law that is applicable to you.

  1. The Information We Collect 

Through the Services, you can, among other activities, order publications and products; sign up for events; engage in various activities including entering contests or sweepstakes, voting in polls or otherwise expressing an opinion; subscribe to one of our services, such as magazines or newsletters; or participate in one of our online forums or communities.

Some of the information we request from you is required in order for you to use our Services. If you do not wish to provide such information to us, you are not obligated to, but as a result you may not be able to use the particular Service. However, some of the information we request from you is optional. This means that you can elect not to provide it to us and you will still be able to use the Service. If not all the information we request on a form is required, we may identify the required information to you such as by displaying an asterisk (*) next to the field where we request the required information.

**Information you give us about yourself or others** : You give information to us directly when, for example, you register for a subscription or newsletter, purchase a product from us, disclose information in response to a survey, apply for a job, or contact our customer service department.

Through some features of the Services and through certain promotions, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name, mailing and/or e-mail address to send a gift or electronic greeting card. The types of personal information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address and telephone number. Please ensure that you notify the person whose information you are providing to us.

Please remember that any information you disclose in any public forum or community areas becomes public information and is immediately accessible to other users, so it is important for you to carefully consider what, if any, information you reveal in these areas.

**Information we collect automatically** : When you interact with our Services, we (and our partners, advertisers, advertising networks and other third party service providers) automatically collect certain information. For example, we collect information about the webpages you view and how you move through our Services, how you reached our Services, how you interact with our social media pages, and how you interact with our email communications.

We (and our partners, advertisers, advertising networks and other third party service providers) use cookies and other tracking technologies to obtain information automatically. Cookies are small text files that are placed in your computer or device to store your preferences. Other information you provide to us may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. A cookie assigns a unique numerical identifier to your Web browser or device, and may enable us to recognize you as the same user who has used our Services, and relate your use of the Services to other information about you. Please see our [Cookies Policy](http://e-qa.time.com/privacy/cookie-policy.html), which explains our use of cookies and similar technologies in connection with our Services and lists partners and other third parties who collect information from you automatically on our Services.

**Affiliates:** We may transfer information to other Time offices for internal management and administrative purposes or where necessary for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for your benefit.

**Sale or Merger of Business** : We may transfer to another entity or its affiliates or service providers some or all information about you in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, acquisition, sale of assets or any line of business, change in ownership control, or financing transaction. We cannot promise that an acquiring party or the merged entity will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Policy.

**Service Providers** : We may disclose personal information to our service providers, which are companies that process information on our behalf, without your consent to deliver the Service and conduct business activities.

The following is a list of categories of our service providers.

  4. Third Party Websites 

Our Services provide links to third party websites or offerings where data privacy practices may be different to that of Time. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of any other company, its websites, or its products and/or services. These linked websites or offerings have separate and independent privacy policies, which we recommend you read carefully. We have no control over such websites or offerings and therefore have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites or offerings may collect, use, disclose, or otherwise treat your personal information.



  5. Your California Privacy Rights: Notice to California Customers 

**California Shine the Light** : California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, requires businesses that disclose personal information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes to give California customers the ability to opt-out of such disclosure. California Residents may exercise their opt-out right by going to our [California Do Not Sell Page](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/ec48745c-0b96-47da-aa41-f959ab79a818/e1de9460-d63a-4d4c-94d8-e876f7bbbb75.html).

**California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”):**

    * _Deletion_ : You have the right to request that we erase data we have collected from you. Please note that we may have a reason to deny your deletion request or delete data in a more limited way than you anticipated, e.g., because of a legal obligation to retain it or to provide a good or service that you request.

      * _Opt-Out of Sale_ : You have the right to request that we stop “selling” your personal information as that that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act. A “sale” of personal information is defined broadly: “selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.” Please see below for more information about our “sales” of personal information.

Our disclosures of personal information include disclosures to our “service providers,” which are companies that we engage for business purposes to conduct activities on our behalf. The categories of service providers with whom we share information and the services they provide are described above.
    * _Categories of personal information we “sell”_ : We may “sell” any of the categories of personal information listed above to third parties, _except_ for Professional or employment-related information; and Education information.

  6. Special Information for Nevada Residents 

Residents of the State of Nevada have the right to opt out of the sale of certain pieces of their information to other companies who will sell or license their information to others. We disclose contact information to third parties that may want to market products or services to you. To opt-out of such sales, please email us at [privacy@time.com](mailto:privacy@time.com?subject=Nevada%20residents%20do%20not%20sell%20my%20personal%20information).



  7. Your Opt-Out Choices 

**Verification Procedures** : We must verify your identity for everyone’s protection. To do so, we may require you to provide us with verification information prior to accessing any records containing personal information about you. We do this by:

    * Asking you to provide personal identifiers we can match against information we may have collected from you previously and confirm your request using the email or telephone number stated in the request; or
    * Having you submit your request through your account page (if you are a subscriber), which will automatically verify your identity and will result in faster processing of your request.

If you are a California resident, you may authorize another individual or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf. If we receive a request from an authorized agent, we require that the authorized agent verify its identity with us, that you verify your identity with us, and that you provide us with proof that you authorized the authorized agent in writing to make the request.

We will use the information you provide for verification only for the purpose of verification. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to respond to your request, or respond to it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.

**Your Account and Payment Information** : If you are a print subscriber, please visit the [account page](https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/MX/TIM/Login_No_API.jsp?cds_page_id=231850&cds_mag_code=TIM&id=1576679095870&lsid=93520824558046323&vid=1) to update your contact information and payment method.

**Marketing and Other Communications** :

    * If you wish to unsubscribe from receiving future email marketing from Time, please use the unsubscribe link that appears at the bottom of our marketing emails.
    * If you are a newsletter subscriber, you may unsubscribe using the unsubscribe options in the newsletter emails.
    * If you wish to opt-out of sharing of your personal information, including contact information, with third parties for marketing purposes, please email us [here](mailto:TIMcustserv@cdsfulfillment.com.?subject=Do%20not%20share%20my%20personal%20information%20with%20third%20parties).
    * If you prefer not to receive traditional mail or other offline promotions from Time, please email us [here](mailto:TIMcustserv@cdsfulfillment.com.?subject=I%20do%20not%20wish%20to%20receive%20offline%20promotions%20from%20TIME).
    * Please note that even if you opt out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may continue to send you transactional communications about your subscription or orders.

**Opt-out of “sale”** : If you are a California resident, you have the right to opt out of our “sale” of personal information to third parties. Please see “  **Your California Privacy Rights: Notice to California Customers** ” above for a description of your rights and information on how to opt out.

**Cookie Management, Analytics, Personalized Advertising, and Do Not Track** :

    * Information about our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is available in our [Cookie Policy](http://e-qa.time.com/privacy/cookie-policy.html).
    * You can control cookies using your web browser’s settings. If you delete your cookies or if you set your browser to decline cookies, some features of the Services may not be available, work, or work as designed.
    * You can use our partners’ links above to learn more about the options they may make available to opt-out of their tracking technologies.
    * You can broadly opt out of participating companies’ website tracking technologies by visiting the websites for the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/), the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), and the [European Interactive Digital Advertising Initiative](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).
    * Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt out of mobile app tracking by some advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the advertiser ID on your mobile device.

When you make an opt-out choice, it does not necessarily mean that you will stop receiving ads altogether, but you will no longer receive personalized ads.

If you delete your cookies, you may also delete your opt-out preferences.

Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. At this time, Time does not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals.



  8. Security of Personal Information 

We have put in place administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect. No system can be completely secure, however, and we do not guarantee that unauthorized disclosures and access will not happen.



  9. Retention of Personal Information 

We will retain your personal information while you have an account with us and thereafter for as long as we have a legitimate need to retain it. Thereafter, we will either delete your personal information or de-identify it so that it is anonymous and not attributed to your identity.



  10. Special Note for Parents 

The site you are visiting is one of the Time general audience sites and is not intended for use by children. If you are under the age of 16 please do not submit any personal information through this site.

The revised Privacy Policy will be posted on this website with the date of the last modification, and we will notify of the changes if required by the applicable law.
