# Time Out Kuala Lumpur - What's on in KL, listings, reviews, events and things to do. 100% independent, 100% KL

Time Out Kuala Lumput ("TOKL") promises to serve its audience with integrity and honesty both in its published matter and online. The same is true now that we publish online. TOKL has developed this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information-gathering and -sharing practices for www.timeoutkl.com (the "site"). By visiting the site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. Our site will develop and evolve over time, and this policy may change to reflect that. 

_**TOKL Privacy's promise**_

We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. We are also committed to the following: (1) We will not pass on any individual user details unless we have your prior consent; and (2) if we don't have your consent to pass on individual user details, we will only give advertisers aggregate statistics about the number of users and their traffic patterns. However, if TOKL changes hands, TOKL reserves the right to transfer all information collected through this site to the new owner.

_**Personal Information**_

TOKL does not require you to provide any personal information in order to access the site www.timeoutkl.com. However, if you choose to fill out any reader surveys, you will be asked to supply some information about yourself, including your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. TOKL keeps track of the number of visitors to the site, the pages they visit and how long they stay. In addition, TOKL collects information from visitors who click on advertisements so that we are able to measure interest in the various areas of our site and inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their ads. TOKL also uses demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on our site to be targeted, in the aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent.

We collect these kinds of aggregate user information for two main reasons: (1) to help us continually improve the service we offer; and (2) to sell sponsorships on the site to appropriate advertisers. TOKL discloses this information to advertisers. Note that advertisers do not have influence over the editorial content or reviews that appear on the site.

_**TOKL e-mail policy**_

When you give us your e-mail address, you are also asked to let us know how we can use it: You can opt to allow us to e-mail you regarding your subscription, or to allow us to send you additional information via e-mail that we believe will be of interest to you. Such requests will be opt-in only, so that you do not inadvertently agree to receive mailings you do not want. 

If you participate in an online survey, you may receive a one-time mailing to confirm your transaction or interaction with our site. Such mailings are one-time only. When you give us your e-mail address under these circumstances, you will also see a box that, when checked by you, will enable TOKL to contact you via e-mail regarding special events, discounts and offers. If you don't want your information to be used for any of these purposes, you should not check the box. 

If we ever request that you volunteer additional information, such as financial data or age (in an online survey, for example) your response will always be voluntary. In addition, there will always be a box for you to check if you choose to enable us to disclose such information to a third party.

Users may opt to receive a regular e-mail newsletter that contains information we believe to be of value to our users, specifically special discounts and offers selected by our marketing department. 

_**TOKL Competitions**_

The only exception to this rule is when holding a competition we may sometimes share your email address with the company who have provided the prizes. We always ask them to ensure that you can opt out of their communications.
