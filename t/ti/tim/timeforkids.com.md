# Time for Kids | About Us

Time Inc. Children's Privacy Notice Your child's privacy is important to us at Time Inc.. We are committed to safeguarding children's personal information collected online, and to helping parents and their children learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet. (Have your child check out our [Safe Surfin' Tips](http://www.pathfinder.com/TFK/aboutus/white/0,6407,130402,00.html) for information on what to do and what not to do on the Internet). The additional measures we have taken to tailor our content and offerings at our children's sites to help children protect their privacy while online include encouraging children to use non-personally identifiable screen names rather than their real names and taking efforts to prevent children from posting contact information. In addition, we do not ask children to disclose more personal information than is necessary for them to participate in an activity. 

To help ensure a rewarding online experience for your child, we provide you with this summary of our information practices to empower you in connection with your child's online experiences. This privacy notice governs the collection and use of information at timeforkids.com, one of Time Inc.'s websites directed to children. 

I. The Information We Collect

At timeforkids.com, we may collect a limited amount of personally identifiable information in the form of e-mail addresses. To enable children to participate in some of our online activities, we may ask them to send us e-mail messages to which we will respond. This information is not retained by timeforkids.com for longer than it takes us to respond to the message. We retain no personally identifiable information from either the original message or our response. 

When children visit our site, we automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows '95 or Mac OS) and browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, and the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). 

II. How We Use the Information

We never share children's personal information with third parties. 

We use children's information only for our internal purposes--such as to enable them to subscribe to our online newsletter, to enter one of our sweepstakes or contests, to express their opinions on various topics, and to send electronic postcards to their friends. 

We also may use children's information to offer children or parents products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to them. 

We use the information that we collect about others to either enable the child to communicate with them, for example, to send an electronic greeting card to a friend, or to obtain your consent for participation in these activities, such as to notify you when your child has entered one of our contests. 

We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. 

We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request. 

This Time Inc. site will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses. 

III. Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites, Advertisers and Sponsors

Our site contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different from ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as the sites are not covered by our privacy policy. 

Time Inc. sites may use reputable third parties to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at its web pages and to conduct research about the advertisements. Our privacy policy does not cover any use of information that such third parties may have collected from you or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs). For more information on this site's use of such third-parties, please [click here](http://www.timeinc.net/legal/parties.html). 

IV. Cookies

timeforkids.com uses a software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information. Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of this website to personal information (e.g., e-mail address) that a visitor has provided, we do not do so for this site. 

We may also use small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect annonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. These "web beacons" may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy. 

V. Security

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. 

VI. Parental Review of Information

As mentioned in Section I, the only personally identifiable information we may collect is e-mail addresses. Since we do not retain that information, we have no parental review procedures. However, if you have any questions about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us. 

VII. Contact Us

VIII. A Final Note to Parents

The Internet offers a world of opportunity for children. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. We encourage you to the visit The Direct Marketing Association's website (www.the-dma.org) and explore the Get CyberSavvy! Program. Get CyberSavvy! helps families learn how information flows online so they can use the Internet in ways that protect their privacy and well-being. It also contains a number of valuable resources to help parents and children be aware of and express their preferences about information that is collected online and how it is used. Your efforts to instill responsible information practices will help steer your children to age-appropriate sites, and will go a long way toward ensuring that your children have enriching experiences online.
