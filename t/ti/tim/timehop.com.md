Civ. Code 1798.140(o).  To the extent that any other provision of this Privacy Policy conflicts a provision of this section, the provision in this section controls as to California residents.  

If you are a California resident, you may:

  * Request that we delete your Personal Information (a “Right to Delete Request”).

  * Opt-out of the sale of your Personal Information (a “Right to Opt-Out Request”).

  * Request information about our collection, use, and disclosure of your information (a “Right to Know Request”), including: 



  1. the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you; 

  2. the categories of sources from which we have collected your Personal Information; 

  3. the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Information; 

  4. the categories of Personal Information we have sold about you; and

  5. the categories of third parties with whom we have shared, disclosed for a business purpose, or sold your Personal Information, and which categories of Personal Information we have sold to which categories of third parties.




We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA.  Consistent with Section 1798.125 of the Act, we may charge users different prices, or provide different levels or quality of goods or services, if the difference is reasonably related to the value of their data.  

  1.  **“RIGHT TO KNOW” REQUESTS**




California residents may submit a Right to Know Request through Settings in the Application or by emailing Timehop at [privacy@timehop.com](mailto:privacy@timehop.com).  California residents may submit two types of Right to Know Requests: (1) A Request for the specific pieces of information that Timehop has collected about you in the past twelve months; or (2) a Request for the categories of Personal Information that Timehop has collected about you in the past twelve months, and how Timehop has used and disclose that information.  When you submit a Right to Know Request, we may ask you to provide certain pieces of information in order to verify your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number.  We may also use a third-party identity verification service to attempt to verify your identity.    

If Timehop is able to verify your identity, we will respond to your Right to Know Request by: (a) providing the requested information; or (b) explaining why the Act does not require us to provide the requested information.  If Timehop is unable to verify your identity, Timehop will respond by explaining why it cannot verify your identity.  

We will confirm receipt of your Right to Know Request within 10 days and will respond to your Request within 45 days. If a response requires additional time, we will notify you of the basis for the delay and may extend our response period up to an additional 45 days.  If the Act requires us to provide the information requested, we will provide the information free of charge and in a readily useable portable format.  We have no obligation to provide Personal Information to you more than twice in a 12-month period.  If a Request or series of Requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the Request(s), or may refuse to process the Request(s).

  1.  **“RIGHT TO OPT-OUT” REQUESTS**




California residents may opt out of the sale of some or all of their Personal Information by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link located in Settings in our Application or by emailing Timehop at privacy@timehop.com.  You may be required to provide certain information to verify your identity.  We will only use that information for purposes of processing the Request. 

Within 15 days of receiving a Right to Opt-Out Request, we will:

  * Not sell your Personal Information unless and until you subsequently provide express authorization for the sale of your Personal Information.

  * Notify all third parties to whom we have sold your Personal Information within 90 days prior to our receipt of your Request that you have exercised your Right to Opt-Out, and instruct them not to further sell your Personal Information.

  * Not ask for permission to sell your Personal Information for 12 months after receiving the Request.  




California residents who have opted out of the sale of their Personal Information may opt back into the sale of their Personal Information in Settings in the Application or by emailing privacy@timehop.com.

When you submit a Right to Delete Request, we may ask you to provide certain pieces of information in order to verify your identity, such as your name, email address, and phone number. If Timehop is able to verify your identity, we will respond to your Request by (a) deleting your Personal Information and, if applicable, directing any of our service providers to delete your Personal Information; or (b) explaining why the Act does not require us to delete your Personal Information.  Timehop may choose to delete Personal Information by de-identifying, aggregating, or completely erasing the information.  We will specify the manner in which we delete your Personal Information.  

If a Request or series of Requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee for processing the Request(s), or may refuse to process the Request(s).

  1.  **AUTHORIZED AGENTS**




California residents may submit Right to Know, Right to Opt-Out, and Right to Delete Requests through an authorized agent.  Unless the agent provides Timehop with a power of attorney executed by the California resident, Timehop may require the California resident to verify their identity with Timehop and/or to provide Timehop with written confirmation of the agent’s authority to make the request.

  1.  **MINORS**
