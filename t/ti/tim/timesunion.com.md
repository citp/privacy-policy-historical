**Our privacy policy**

This privacy policy describes how Hearst Communications Inc., publisher of the _Times Union_ , treats the personally identifiable information that is collected about you when you visit [**timesunion.com**](http://timesunion.com/) and [**albany2go.com**](http://albany2go.com/), the Web sites of the _Times Union_. If you have any questions or concerns about these privacy guidelines, please send e-mail to [**webmaster**](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com). 

This privacy policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except Hearst Communications ("Hearst") and only applies to the Web sites to which this policy is linked. Any information you provide when you visit Web sites other than those covered by this policy (including other Web sites affiliated with Hearst) or when you purchase any products or services that may be offered or advertised on our Web site by companies other than Hearst, is subject to the privacy policies of the organizations who run and/or own these Web sites. This policy also does not apply to information you may provide to us offline.

**What information does the _Times Union_ collect?**

For individuals 13 and older, the _Times Union_ collects "personally identifying information" only when you specifically and knowingly provide it. We gather and save this information in the following ways:

  * During registration for a contest, poll or forum
  * Via e-mail and feedback forms 
  * When you subscribe to the Times Union online
  * When you view stories in our online library



(The _Times Union_ also gathers names and e-mail addresses when you send electronic postcards and forward articles to friends using the link that appears at the bottom of most stories. However, we do not store this information; it is used only to send the postcard or story.) 

At the bottom of pages that collect your personally identifiable information, we ask if you would like to receive updates about the _Times Union_ , timesunion.com, albany2go.com or features or targeted promotions from our advertisers. This opt-in system defaults to "no" unless you check otherwise. 

The _Times Union_ also collects non-personally identifiable information including the server that your computer is logged onto, your operating system and your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer). This information is gathered in server log files for traffic analysis, via online forms for help and troubleshooting and by our ad server software (RealMedia's OpenAdStream) when an advertisement is presented. The information collected by the ad server is not personally identifiable and is used only to measure traffic and advertising effectiveness. 

**What about cookies?**

If you turn on the cookie notification setting of your browser, you will see that we sometimes place a "cookie" on your computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information about you. Rather, we use cookies for several purposes: 

  * To analyze traffic and measure click throughs to our advertisers' sites. 
  * To track voting in our polls. 
  * To record your user name and password information while you are visiting our library.



Some of our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.

If you don't want cookies, most Web browsers include an option that allows you to not accept them. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of our sites may not function efficiently.

**How does the _Times Union_ use the information it collects?**

The _Times Union_ uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. If you subscribe to the _Times Union_ , we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to deliver the paper. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. 

If you opt-in by checking the box at the bottom of registration forms, your personally identifying information may be used for additional purposes, such as e-mailing you with information about new features and offers from the _Times Union_ , albany2go.com or timesunion.com. In addition, if you opt-in, we may send you advertising information or other offers we think may be of interest. 

Individuals always have the ability to stop receiving these e-mails by sending an e-mail request to us at [**webmaster**](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com). You may also make reasonable requests to review the personal data collected from you and to correct any errors. 

**Does the _Times Union_ share the information with anyone else?**

The _Times Union_ may disclose information with third parties if you have given your consent to that disclosure by opting in by checking the applicable space. The _Times Union_ may disclose information if it is required by law through a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process or if we need to protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you owe us for a subscription). In this instance, the disclosure may take place without your consent. In addition, we may disclose information to third party service providers we use to provide products, services or functions on our behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your information and not to use your it for any reason except to carry out the purpose for which we hired them. Finally, we may share your information with entities under control of, or under common control with Hearst (for these purposes, a company controlling twenty (20%) percent or more of the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to control such entity). 

Beyond that, the information is not shared with any third parties. 

**How can I be sure that the privacy policy is maintained?**

To ensure internal compliance with this privacy policy, the online editor of the _Times Union_ reviews and authorizes any use of information. 

**What about information I share in your forums?**

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., your name, e-mail address) in the forums or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. 

**When was this privacy policy most recently updated?**

We updated this privacy policy on August 15,2002. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time. Your continued use of our sites indicates your consent to this privacy policy and any amended versions of it.

**Are you a non-U.S. User?**

If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using this Web site, you consent to this transfer. 

**Still have questions or concerns?**

Send e-mail to us at [**webmaster**](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com) with any further questions. 

**Children Under 13 Years Old:**

The _Times Union_ does not knowingly collect or solicit personally-identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us -- including information like your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public forums. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. 

If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at: [**webmaster@timesunion.com**](mailto:webmaster@timesunion.com).

**Children, 13-18 Years Old:**

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
