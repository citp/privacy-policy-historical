You value your privacy. And we respect that. When you shop with timberland.com, we need to collect a certain amount of information about you to make shopping easier for you--and for us. We believe that you have a right to know how we use that information and how we keep it secure. So we've answered the most frequently asked questions below.

**What information do we collect?**

When you order from our website, we need to know information such as your name, e-mail address, billing address and phone number, and credit card number so we can process and fill your order and contact you if we have any questions.

You can also create an account with us by providing similar information. Or you may provide preferences such as products you may be interested in. In either case, we'll use the information to make your shopping more efficient and better serve your interests.

When you visit our website, we automatically collect clickstream information such as the address of the website that you came from before visiting our site, which pages you visit on our site, which browser you used to view our site and any search terms you may have entered on our site. This information is anonymous--meaning we cannot identify you personally--unless you identify yourself, for example, by making a purchase or by creating an account.

Now and then, we may conduct surveys, run contests or other promotions. If you choose to participate in one of our surveys or contests, we'll probably ask for some personal information such as your shopping habits, e-mail address and other information so we can run the promotion and notify winners.

When you send us a request, such as to our customer service department, or inquire about career opportunities or participate in an Investor Relations presentation, we may ask you to identify yourself by name or e-mail address in order to send you a response, if appropriate.

**How do we use the information?**

When you place an order on our website, we use your information to process and fill your order. We may send you an e-mail to confirm or to update you on your order. We may also need to contact you by regular mail, e-mail or phone if we have any questions about your order.

When you order, create an account, complete a survey or participate in a contest or promotion on our website, we'll use the information to send e-mail or regular mail to you about our products, services or other contests and promotions you might be interested in, unless you indicate that you do not wish to receive such mail.

We may also use the information to personalize your shopping experience by using your product interests, shopping patterns and purchase information to recommend other products, services or promotions that we believe might interest you including those of other companies. We may also notify you of changes to the website.

We maintain the information that you provide us, along with a record of your purchases, in a database. To best serve you, we may combine this information with data that is publicly available and data that we collect in our own stores, at our marketing events, or receive from other business partners and/or reputable sources whose policies meet the Direct Marketing Association's privacy standards.

Also, we may, from time to time, review your information and information of other customers to help us analyze trends, purchasing patterns and preferences, and demographics.

**Do we share your information with third parties?**

We share your information with our trusted third party service providers who manage our website. These third parties provide specific services and administer activities offered at our website; for example, customer service and credit card processing. These third parties are not authorized to discuss, disclose or make any use of your personal information except as necessary to provide such services.

Now and then, we may also use third parties to help us collect and aggregate site guest and customer information. We may share this aggregated, non-personally identifiable information (such as age, clickstream visit and product interests) with existing and prospective business partners and advertisers. None of the aggregate information will contain any information that identifies you individually.

We may also share your personal information with carefully screened Timberland business partners to offer you products and services that we believe might interest you. But, only The Timberland Company, Timberland Retail, Inc., or other Timberland affiliates and business partners will send you these messages. In each case, our partners will not be authorized to discuss, disclose, or make any use of your personal information except for extending the offer to you. If you prefer not be included in these types of prospective offers, please contact us by e-mail to onlineservice@timberland.com to let us know. Please be sure to include your first and last name, street address, and email address in your request.

If you apply for the Timberland MasterCard card online or select an alternative payment process (such as Google Checkout or Bill Me Later), you provide the personal and financial information needed to process your application or purchase directly to each provider. The companies that administer these programs are independent of Timberland and have their own privacy and security policies. We encourage you to learn more about their policies.

We or our third party service providers may disclose specific individual information if we or they reasonably believe that it's necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations or to protect the interests of The Timberland Company, Timberland Retail, Inc., Timberland business partners, affiliates or its guests, or the interests of our third party service providers.
