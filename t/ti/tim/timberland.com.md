This Privacy Policy describes what information we may collect from you, how we collect that information, how we use that information, and the choices you have regarding your information. By using our website, mobile applications, or providing information to us in other ways, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy was last updated May 29, 2015, and may be updated from time to time. Please check back periodically for further updates and changes. The most updated version will be the one that is available on this website.

#### WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS COLLECTED AND STORED?

**Information You Provide**

We collect and store information that you provide to us through our websites, in our stores, through our customer service representatives, at events, through mobile applications, through marketing efforts, including contests, sweepstakes and events, and through third parties, or any other way we interact with you. We are one of the VF Corporation family of brands and may also receive information about you from other brands held by VF Corporation.

You may choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of certain capabilities of this website, our mobile applications or other services we may offer.  For example, you must provide certain personal information in order to place an order or to register for an account on or through this website.

We may request, collect and store some or all of the following types of personal information: name, billing address, shipping address, e-mail address, telephone number, financial and payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date, gender, personal interests, birthday, information about a third party you provide when we ship an order. We may also maintain a record of your product interest and purchases. 

If you access our website or mobile applications with your log-in credentials from a social networking site (e.g. Facebook, Pinterest, or Twitter) or if you otherwise agree to associate your account with us with a social networking site, we may receive personal information about you from such social networking site, in accordance with the terms of use and privacy policy of the social networking site. We may add this to the information we have already collected from you via other interactions.

When you download or use our mobile applications, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services like local store information, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow users to disable location services by using controls located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, please contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.

**Automatically Collected Information**

We collect and store certain other non-personally identifiable information automatically whenever you interact with us. For example, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address and browser information and reference site domain name when you visit this website and analyze this data for preferences, trends, and site usage statistics.

We may also collect information by using cookies, web beacons, and related technologies in order to analyze and understand how the website is used and to enhance your visits to the website. For example, we may use cookies and related technologies to: (i) customize account pages for you, (ii) track user visits and account features, (iii) determine what features and pages are most frequently requested or visited, and (iv) save your password so you do not have to provide it each time you visit the website.

"Cookies" are small text files that a website sends to a user's hard drive through the browser for data storage. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. By disabling or otherwise rejecting cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings on this website. We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience on this website.

We use third-party companies to provide Internet data hosting and to help us measure and determine how visitors use our website and the effectiveness of our website and promotions in order to help us improve and optimize our website and the products and services we offer. We also use third-party companies to serve advertisements (banners or links) on our behalf across the Internet. These companies use tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) to collect non-identifiable information about your visits to our website and your interactions with our products and services in order to provide tailored advertisements based on your interests and browsing of our website (remarketing) on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. We use third-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) to better understand and advertise to audiences that visit our website. We do not use or associate personally identifiable information with remarketing lists, cookies, data feeds, or other anonymous identifiers. 

Our websites currently do not have a mechanism to recognize “Do Not Track” signals, but several of the third-party companies who utilize these cookies or beacons enable you to opt out of this advertising. If you wish to opt out of receiving this third-party interest-based advertising, you may obtain more information [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed). Please note that this does not opt you out of receiving marketing communications from us.

In addition, some of our e-mail communications to you may include a "click-through URL" linked to a particular page on the website. By clicking on one of these URLs, you will automatically enter our website and we may collect information related to the "click-through." You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on URL links in our e-mail communications.

We also may use a variety of retail analytics tools in our stores for operational and marketing purposes, such as measuring and analyzing traffic patterns. These tools may collect data from sensors, including video cameras, smartphone detectors, Wi-Fi networks, or other devices, to improve your in-store experience.

**Information from Other Sources**

We may collect information about you from third-party sources and information that is publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social network site) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances. Another example, is that we may receive demographic information about you from a third party to make our service and marketing efforts more efficient and personalized for you. 

#### HOW IS INFORMATION USED?

We use the personal information we collect to conduct our business, communicate with you, and provide great products, services, and experiences. We or third-party service providers we engage may use the information to provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested, to process and ship orders, to send order and shipping confirmations, to provide customer service, to respond to your comments, questions or complaints, to personalize your experiences, to analyze your preferences and shopping habits, to analyze trends and statistics, to administer and fulfill our contests and other promotions, to analyze and improve the website and our products and services, and to send you marketing communications and other information regarding our products, services, marketing, or special events. We also use your information for business purposes such as security, payment processing, analytics, operations, fraud detection, reporting, making back-ups, and legal compliance.

You always have the choice not to receive marketing communications. For instructions on opting out of those communications, please see the section entitled “Can I Indicate Whether or Not I Want to Receive Promotional Communications?” below.

In order to help protect personal information you provide to us, you: (i) should not share your password or account information with others, (ii) should use a secure web browser, and (iii) should change your password frequently. If you wish to cancel a password, or if you become aware of any loss, theft, or unauthorized use of a password, please contact us as set forth below under "How Can I Contact You Regarding This Privacy Policy?"
