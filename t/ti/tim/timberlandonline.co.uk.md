## **HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION**

## **PARTIES WITH WHICH WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

The VF local subsidiary from which you purchase products shares your personal data with VF International Sagl for marketing purposes (but, when required by law, we ask your consent before doing so).

We also share your personal data with:

·       other VF entities and third party providers that help us operate this website and provide our products and services (these recipients act on our behalf and under our instructions only);

·       third parties in case of judicial processes, request by courts or authorities, other legal obligation, to defend our rights, or in case of merger, acquisition, or assets transfer.

Some of these recipients are located outside the EEA, but we ensure that your personal data remain at all times adequately protected (if the country of destination is not one that the EU Commission considers offers an adequate level of protection, we cover the data transfer by appropriate safeguards).

## **NECESSARY v. OPTIONAL INFORMATION**

Some of your personal data are necessary to complete your purchase or to provide the service that you request from us. If you refuse to provide these personal data, it would make it impossible for us to complete the purchase or provide the requested service.

Providing personal data for survey, marketing and other profiling purposes is however optional. If you refuse, this will not have any impact on the purchase or the provision of the service you requested.  __
