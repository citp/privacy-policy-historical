# Timeform terms of use

## **Timeform terms of use for desktop website and app**

**These Terms of Use exist between you and Timeform Limited ("Timeform"). By using Timeform and/or Infogol desktop and/or mobile sites/apps and by registering with Timeform you agree to be bound by, and comply with, the Terms of Use.**

Users must be over 18 years of age. Timeform information is supplied for the exclusive use of the individual subscriber and must not be copied, reproduced or distributed in any way without explicit permission in writing. Please read our full copyright notice below. Commercial users in any doubt about whether their current or intended usage infringes these terms should contact Timeform for clarification.

If we make significant changes to these Terms of Use we will take appropriate steps to bring such changes to your attention (such as by placing a notice of change in a prominent position on the Timeform web site). It is your responsibility to check those Terms of Use from time to time to ensure you agree with them and your continued use of the Timeform web site will be deemed to be your acceptance of any changes to the Terms of Use.

_These terms were last updated on 6th November 2018 to add additional information about Infogol and Timeform Greyhounds._

### **Fair usage**

We operate a 'fair usage' policy and, while normal behaviour will not contravene this, excessive high-frequency calls, by any means, may result in suspension of access to timeform.com. Consistent with our copyright policy below, data capture including, but not limited to, screen scraping is expressly prohibited.

### **Availability**

We will make every reasonable effort to ensure the desktop and/or mobile sites/apps are continuously available and that interruptions to service will be kept to a minimum and, where possible, advertised in advance. However, we do not promise that the website, products or individual features will be available at all times or at specific times. There will be no right to compensation or refunds, in full or part, arising from interruptions to service or non-availability of products unless expressly covered elsewhere in these terms and conditions nor any liability accepted for losses, direct or implied, arising from the same.

### **Registration**

In order to access some content, and to make any purchase, you will need to be registered. There is no charge to register.

To register you are required to complete all mandatory fields, including a permanent email address at which you can be contacted in the event of queries about your account. We do not accept registrations from email domains specifically designed to offer temporary mailboxes and, for security reasons, we reserve the right not to respond to account enquiries sent from different addresses. You may opt out of promotional emails at any time using the account management page.

Certain services may not be available in certain countries due to regulatory conditions.

_Concerned about privacy? See our privacy policy below._

### **Account Balances and Account Management**

Account balances held with Timeform may only be used to purchase goods and services from Timeform. For the avoidance of doubt, any bets placed with Third Party Bookmakers via the Timeform desktop and mobile sites/apps are transactions between you and the Third Party Bookmaker alone and such bets may not be placed using money held in any Timeform account.

To fund an account online you must use a credit or debit card. If you wish to fund an account using bank transfer or cheque please contact our customer services team for more information.

The minimum online transaction is currently £5. (Please note that all transactions are posted in GB sterling, so the amount paid may vary for international customers.) The charge for any download is then deducted from your current timeform.com account balance, but only once you have confirmed the download request. If an account balance neither increases nor decreases for a consecutive period of four years the account will be considered obsolete and will be closed without further notice.

We may also consider accounts obsolete when they have a zero balance and have not been accessed for a consecutive period of at least three months. Such accounts may also closed without further notice.

Only one user may be logged in to a single account at any time and this user may only have one active internet session.

### **Promotions and Free Credits**

Unless expressly stated, all promotional offers on Timeform goods and services, whether online or offline, are made on the basis of one claim per household. Repeat use of promotion codes is prohibited and the setting up of multiple accounts or other such action in an attempt to avoid restrictions will lead to access to those accounts being denied and balances being removed in full without notice.

Promotional credits (also referred to as 'free credits', the same rules applying to both) are normally awarded through vouchers that form part of specific promotions providing additional free credits for your account.

Promotional credits must be spent within 28 days and may be lost at any time thereafter. We will send an email 14 days before we remove promotional credits. No other notice will be given about the loss or other removal of the free credits.

Your account balance shows in the header whenever you are logged in. Clicking on the balance will take you to your account management page where you can see the split between your real money balance and promotional balance.

Promotional credits may be used only for online services available on this website and may not be used for mail order items or telephone subscription services. No refunds will be given for credits awarded in this way.

Where applicable, and when available, the cost of any eligible transaction will be deducted from your promotional balance before your normal credits are consumed.

### **Online Timeform Race Cards**

Timeform Race Cards for meetings in Britain and Ireland will usually be available by 4.30pm on the day on which final declarations are made. The exception is for meetings for which declarations are made on Saturday. These will normally be published on Sunday morning. Occasionally important festival meetings may also be covered by cards published at the five-day stage.

Members may download the Timeform Race Card for the same meeting up to five times at no extra cost. If you download a Race Card for a meeting which is subsequently abandoned before racing commences, we will return the credit used to your account.

The format of the pdf version of the Race Card is identical to that of the version that is sold on the racecourse and by mail order. You will require the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to open these files.

### **Printed Timeform Race Cards**

Printed Timeform Race Cards are sold at most major racecourses and are available by post for selected meetings. Please contact us for full details of availability.

If a Race Card is not delivered before racing commences, or if a meeting is subsequently abandoned before racing commences, we provide a credit which may be used against a future meeting. We do not provide refunds nor will we email a copy of the card involved (see below).

### **Important note on printed publications**

The printed Timeform Race Card and the online Timeform Race Card are separate publications and have entirely separate pricing structures and promotions. Unless paying for both versions separately, it is not permitted to order a Race Card by post and then download the same card from timeform.com. Nor is it permitted to download a card and then to exchange it for a printed version on the racecourse. Special offers available at timeform.com may not be available on the racecourse (or by post) (and vice versa). The same guidelines apply for other products which are published in both electronic and printed formats, such as Horses To Follow Extra and the Timeform Bloodstock Sales Guide.

### **Race Passes – recurring subscriptions**

We offer two ways of subscribing to Race Passes using recurring payments, by PayPal and by monthly Direct Debit. Recurring payments normally offer a lower equivalent cost per day than other subscription options.

If you have a PayPal account you can activate a recurring payment immediately by following the instructions available on the site. Subsequent charges to your PayPal account will be made to the schedule implied at the time of purchase. For example:

  * If you take out a monthly subscription on 16th of the month the next payment will be charged to your PayPal account on 16th of the following month.



You can cancel your next PayPal payment using your PayPal account itself or by [contacting our customer services team](https://www.timeform.com/horse-racing/about/contact).

It is not possible to activate or manage Direct Debit payments online. Further details are available by contacting our customer services team.

The same recurring charges apply regardless of how much racing takes place during the period covered by your payment. No refunds, in part or in full, will be issued once a payment for a period has been processed.

For both PayPal and Direct Debit we require a minimum of two working days’ notice if you wish to cancel your recurring payment. If a payment is declined by your payment provider then access to Race Passes will be suspended immediately.

### **Race Passes – non-recurring subscriptions**

Race Passes are also available by timed access (currently for 1, 7 or 28 days).

Timed access begins at the time of purchase unless a valid order is already in progress, in which case the new purchase takes effect immediately following the end of the existing one. The account summary page shows the expiration date and time of the current subscription.

The same charge for timed access applies regardless of your Race Passes usage within that period or of how much racing is scheduled. No refunds will be issued once a subscription has been activated.

### **Race Passes – individual races**

When purchased individually, a Race Pass page may be visited any number of times without incurring additional charges. There is no limit to how many runners in the race may be clicked on, nor how many times each of them may be clicked on. However, if you purchase an individual race at the entry stage please note you are purchasing access to a race number (e.g. Race One) at the meeting and not the specific event. This means that if the race order changes at the declaration stage your purchase will apply to the new race in this position on the card and it may be necessary to make an additional purchase to view the original contest.

### **Horse search**

The Timeform Rating which appears alongside each horse's name in these searches is the current master rating(s) or, in the event of horses that have retired or been exported, its most recent master rating(s). Similarly the commentary is relevant to the latest occasion on which the horse ran in a race covered by Timeform. Please note that the horse may have run since its Timeform details were last reviewed, particularly in the case of a horse that has been exported from Britain/Ireland or one that has never raced there.

Similarly, where a trainer or owner is shown, these details apply to the last occasion the horse came under the Timeform microscope and they should not be taken to imply that they are still connected with the horse.

### **Database Coverage - Horse Racing**

Timeform provides commentaries and ratings for all horses that have raced in Britain since the early 1990s. Comprehensive coverage of Irish jumps racing began in October 2007, and of Irish Flat racing in February 2008. Selected European pattern races and Grade 1 races in North America are also covered. A larger number of overseas horses are covered by ratings only (see below).

**Updating information after the race**

Timeform Ratings and commentaries are constantly reviewed in the light of new form evidence. For racing in Britain and Ireland a provisional performance rating appears soon after the race and a report is usually published within a few hours. Note that these initial impressions are always subject to confirmation following broader consultation across the editorial team and that these may occasionally lead to substantial revisions once the full review of the day's racing has been completed. During this period, a very recent performance rating may also be significantly higher or lower than the master rating shown.

The review is normally completed by 17:00 GMT the following day. The most notable exception to this schedule is Saturday racing, which is completed by close of business on Monday. Very occasionally the volume of racing on Bank Holidays means that work on the minor meetings may not be completed to this schedule.

Please note that the same Horse Search enquiry can usually be repeated several times within a given period without additional cost. This means, for example, that if the particular horse enquiry you have requested does not yet incorporate the latest start then you can look again later in the day (or the next day) at no extra cost. We regret it is not possible to provide a specific time by which particular work will be completed.

Ratings for the top horses in the other major racing nations covered by Timeform will normally be revised within two or three days of a start. At busy times, however, there may be a longer delay. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

Timeform Ratings are maintained for all racing in Britain and Ireland, and for significant pattern races in Europe and Grade 1 races in North America. Other ratings, such as those for racing in Dubai, are compiled for the interest of subscribers but may not be available to the same schedule.

**Note for bloodstock advertisers**

As the Timeform editorial database is constantly being updated it should be used for information purposes only. References to Timeform in bloodstock advertisements should only quote from either the Timeform annuals (Racehorses and Chasers & Hurdlers), Race Passes (no sooner than 48 hours after the horse's latest outing), or the weekly Timeform Black Book. Specific permission to quote from Timeform publications in bloodstock advertisements is not required providing any quotations or ratings used accurately reflect our overall opinion and are credited.

**My Timeform**

My Timeform is currently available free of charge to registered users.

You may store comments of up to 8,000 characters associated with any horse on the Timeform database and/or opt in to receive email notifications about entries and results for those horses. These emails are not dependent upon or subject to the marketing preferences you have chosen.

Comments must not be profane, libellous or malicious. Timeform does not warrant that these comments will be available at any specific time and there is no right to access the comments in any way other than through normal use of the desktop and mobile sites/apps. Accounts not used for a continuous period of more than 12 months may have the comments and alerts removed.

Any material you add to the site is at your own risk. Timeform accepts no liability for the loss of this material or failure to reproduce content on request or for email alerts that are not delivered on schedule (or at all).

### **Database Coverage - Greyhounds**

Timeform provides results for greyhound races in Great Britain only since January 2013. Content of results may change over time as datasets are added or removed.

**Updating information**

Information is published in real time as we receive files from our third-party data partner. No warranties are given about the specific availability of pre-race information or post-race results, times or ratings, nor their accuracy.

### **Database Coverage - Football**

Infogol coverage begins with the 2014/15 English league season. Other competitions have been added subsequently at various times and may be removed at any time without notice.

**Updating information**

Information is published in real time as we receive files from our third-party data partners. No warranties are given about the specific availability of pre-match information, in-game updates, or post-match results. Users should note that previously published live data is subject to revision after review.

### **Timeform Jury**

Membership of and/or receipt of any information that forms part of the Timeform information service (including the Jury and Jury Daily) is provided under strict Terms of Use. Information is provided on the express understanding that it is for the customer’s personal use and not for disclosure or resale to any third party. It is a condition of these terms that information must not be disclosed to others or reproduced or published in any form without Timeform’s prior written permission. Timeform owns or has rights to all such information. We reserve the right to initiate legal proceedings against any person breaching these Terms of Use or inducing others to breach these Terms of Use. Use of any Timeform information service shall be deemed acceptance of the Terms of Use for that service.

Charges for the Jury relate to a specific period of time, agreed and identified within the offer to join. Timeform regrets that misunderstandings concerning the duration of a subscription cannot be rectified once a PIN number has been issued. The same charges will apply, regardless of the number of days on which bets are recommended or of the number of days the member calls. Unless stated in the terms of a specific offer, membership of the service will be considered to have begun at the time of placing your order. No refunds will be available on the unused part of any subscription.

### **Online shop and mail order (timeform.com/shop)**

All purchases must be paid for at the time of ordering and items may not be purchased using timeform.com promotional credit balances. Orders will normally be processed during the next working day. (See the contact page for current opening hours.) Please note that, to avoid delays in the despatch of items (many of which contain dated matter), your credit/debit card will be charged at the time of placing the order rather than at the time of despatch.

After successfully placing an order you will receive confirmation to your registered email address, including the details, mailing address, and expected posting date(s). If you do not receive this email please contact shop@timeform.com separately to confirm receipt. Please do not repeat the order, as this may result in multiple charges to your credit/debit card.

If you wish to cancel all or part of an order you must contact shop@timeform.com at least 48 hours before the advised posting date of the item(s) involved.

Items containing dated matter are sent by 1st class post within the UK, but next day delivery is not guaranteed.

A contract is not formed until the first item in your order has been despatched. We verify the amount you have been charged as part of our despatch procedures, and if a product's correct price at the time you placed your order is either lower or higher than that shown at timeform.com/shop we will contact you and invite you to resubmit your order at the correct price.

### **Advertising statements**

Advertising statements regarding Timeform top-rated horses, and races won by them, are based upon the top-rated Flags displayed in the final declared version of the Timeform Race Card and within Race Passes. To ensure consistency in the calculation of performance statistics, if the horse carrying the top-rated Flag for a race is subsequently announced as a non-runner there is considered to be no Timeform top-rated in that contest. Statements relating to other Flags, such as Horses In Focus, are based on the same declared information, not on Flags that may have been shown at other times.

Advertising statements regarding Infogol selections are based upon the following: Analyst Verdict--the advised price, available with Betfair Sportsbook at the time of first publication; pre-match value bet and predictions--selection and Betfair Sportsbook price at 07:00 on matchday; pre-match first/anytime goalscorer--selection and Betfair Sportsbook price at the time line-ups are first published by Infogol; Half-Time Team Talk recommendations--selection and Betfair Sportsbook price at the time of first publication. Please note in particular that as 'value bet' and other selections are based on the odds available at the time the original selection(s) may change if the market moves significantly.

### **Links to other websites**

Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.

### **Bet Placement**

In addition to the general Terms of Use the following terms apply expressly to Bet Placement through links available on the Timeform desktop and/or mobile sites/apps.

The odds displayed are received directly from selected Third Party Bookmakers and are as close to real-time as possible. All of the odds shown remain the property and responsibility of the Third Party Bookmakers themselves.

All such data is shown in good faith and Timeform does not guarantee its availability or accuracy, nor accept liability for errors in prices, odds, incorrectly calculated winnings, events or markets or odds changes prior to a bet being placed and will not be liable for any loss suffered by any party if the service is unavailable or inaccurate in any way.

Opening a betslip either navigates you to the Third Party Bookmaker’s site or connects you to the Third Party Bookmaker’s betting API. Please ensure you check all your bet details are correct on the betslip before placing a bet. You are solely responsible and liable for all activity that occurs after leaving the Timeform desktop and/or mobile sites/apps and for activity on the Third Party Bookmaker’s account.

Certain promotions may be subject to withdrawal or cancellation and may only be available for specific periods and on certain specific terms. You must ensure that the promotion you are interested in is still available, that you are eligible, and that you understand any terms which apply to it.

Terms and conditions vary between Third Party Bookmakers and you are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with the individual terms and conditions involved. At the discretion of the individual Third Party Bookmaker the following error correction policies may be used:

Incorrect Price

Prior to the start of an event, In-Play or after the event, where an obvious error is identified any open bets will stand and be settled at the bookmakers revised price. Any bet placed where the outcome is already known when the bet was placed will be void.

Wrong Participant

If a wrong participant is quoted for any event, bets placed on that participant will be void and bets on other participants may also be void.

If you are concerned a mistake has been made then contact the Third Party Bookmaker you placed the bet with directly.

**International Transfers**

Paddy Power Betfair plc operates businesses in multiple jurisdictions some of which are not located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Countries outside the EEA do not always have strong data protection laws. Where we transfer personal information from the EEA to other countries in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of data privacy protection as in your home country, we take measures to provide an appropriate level of data privacy protection. For example, we use approved contractual clauses, intragroup agreements and other measures designed to ensure that the recipients of your personal information protect it. We take steps to ensure that the information we collect is processed according to this privacy policy and the requirements of the applicable law wherever the data is located. Please contact us below if you require further information.
