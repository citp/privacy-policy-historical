Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and its features, to administer your account and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.

  * When you register with the Site and/or download the TimeBridge software (“Members”) or merely reply to a Member’s invitation to participate in a meeting without registering with us (“Non-Members”) (collectively referred to as “Participants”) we may collect personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, name, email address, postal address, telephone number, credit card number, and account user name and password (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is information about you that when on its own or in combination with other identifiers can be used to contact or identify you. We use your Personal Information to provide you the Services, facilitate your use of the Site and respond to your inquiries.
  * We also may collect (i) any non-personally identifiable information that is provided to TimeBridge as part of registration or in a Participant’s response to an invitation, including, but not limited to, time zone; what email client a Participant uses (e.g., Outlook), and job function; and (ii)non-personally identifiable service usage data, including, but not limited to, whether a Non-Member ultimately registers to become a Member, the volume of the Meeting Materials (defined below) Participants circulate amongst themselves as a result of using the Services and the number of meetings TimeBridge Users schedule through use of the Services (collectively “Anonymous Demographic Information”). We may combine your Personal Information with this Anonymous Demographic Information or with aggregate information collected from other Participants to attempt to provide you with a better experience and improve the quality and value of the Services. From time to time, the use of Anonymous Demographic Information and Personal Information will include providing you with targeted advertising as you use the Services such that you can have access to information and products that may be of interest to you.
  * As a Participant or a Site visitor just browsing (who has provided us with their email address) we may use your Personal Information to send you via email TimeBridge newsletters, promotional materials about other products or services and other information that you have requested or that may be of interest to you. We may also email you messages that allow you to purchase new or enhanced TimeBridge products and services. Where Participants agree to the terms and conditions of TimeBridge Terms of Service they are given the opportunity to opt-in to the receipt of such information from us in the future. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information from us, you may follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in the communication or you may also update your registration preferences information. (See “Changing or Deleting Information,” below.)



### Log Information

When you visit the Site, whether as a Participant or a Site visitor just browsing, like many websites our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Information”). This Log Information may include information such as your IP address, date and time, browser type and the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider (or “ISP”), the IP address will be different every time you log on. We do not use this information to identify you personally. We use it to analyze usage trends, administer the Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical maintenance.

### Cookies

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your registration account user name and password for future logins to the Services. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services, and to monitor aggregate usage of the Services by Participants and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you disconnect from the Services. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services. You can learn more about the use of cookies by visiting http://networkadvertising.org or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie .

### Phishing

We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your TimeBridge user name, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to TimeBridge. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our priority. For more information about phishing, you may want to visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt127.htm
