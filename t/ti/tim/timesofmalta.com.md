* ### Who this privacy statement applies to and what it covers? 

This privacy notice is to let you know how we process your personal data. This includes what you tell us about yourself, what we learn by having you as a customer, and the choices you give us about direct marketing communications you want us to send you. This notice explains how we do this and informs you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your information in an open and transparent manner.

When this policy mentions “we” or “us,” it refers to the controller of your information under this policy. The legal person responsible for your personal data under this privacy statement is Allied Newspapers Limited, a company registered in Malta at 341 Strickland House, St Paul Street, Valletta.

This privacy statement sets out how we will collect, handle, store and protect information about you when:

  * providing services to you, by for example, giving you the opportunity, as a registered user of our Website, to post comments on our Disqus portal;
  * you use “our Website” or;
  * performing any other activities that form part of the operation of our business, such as for example, granting you, as a registered user of our Website, access to our [Digital Archive](https://web.archive.org/archive) as well as other services we provide for our registered users under the [Services](https://web.archive.org/services) tab.



When we refer to “our Website” or “this Website” in this policy we mean www.timesofmalta.com.

This privacy statement also contains information about when we share your personal data with other third parties (for example, our service providers).

In this privacy statement, your information is sometimes called “personal data” or “personal information”. We may also sometimes collectively refer to handling, collecting, protecting and storing your personal information as “processing” such personal information.

We use many different kinds of personal information and group them as follows.

Type of personal information | Description  
---|---  
Contact | Where you live and how to contact you.  
Socio-Demographic | This includes details about your work or profession, nationality, education and where you fit into general social or income groupings.  
Transactional | Details about payments to and from your accounts with us.  
Contractual | Details about the products or services we provide to you.  
Locational | Data we get about where you are, which may come from your mobile phone, or the address where you connect a computer to the Internet.

Technical | Details on the devices and technology you use.  
Communications | What we learn about you from letters, e-mails and conversations between us.

* ### What information do we gather/track about you?

We may collect or obtain such data because you give it to us (for example in a form on our Website), or because it is publicly available.

Other examples of what information we may collect about you include the following:

The data controller (i.e. the party who decides for what purpose personal data is to be held or processed) for the data collected online, including but not limited to the personal information provided upon subscription, is Allied Newspapers Limited.

#### Sending data outside of the EEA

Please note that some of the recipients of your personal data referenced above may be based in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) whose laws may not provide the same level of data protection.

Read more on the [EU data protection site](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en). 

#### What if you choose not to give personal information?

We may need to collect personal information by law, or under the terms of a contract, we have with you.

If you choose not to give us this personal information, it may delay or prevent us from meeting our obligations. It may also mean that we cannot perform services needed to run your subcription. It could mean that we cancel a product or service you have with us.

Any data collection that is optional would be made clear at the point of collection.

* ### The measures taken to protect your personal information

We use a range of physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your personal data secure, accurate and up to date. These measures include: 

  * education and training to relevant staff to ensure they are aware of our privacy obligations when handling personal data;
  * administrative and technical controls to restrict access to personal data on a ‘need to know’ basis;
  * technological security measures, including firewalls, encryption and anti-virus software;
  * physical security measures, such as staff security passes to access our premises.



Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal data, the transmission of data over the Internet (including by e-mail) is never completely secure. We endeavour to protect personal data, but we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to us or by us.

* ### How long we keep your information for? 

We will hold your personal data on our systems for the longest of the following periods:

  1. as long as you are a customer of Allied Newspapers Limited;
  2. any retention period that is required by law; 
  3. the end of the period in which litigation or investigations might arise in respect of the product and services.



After you stop being a customer, we may keep your data for periods of time as allowed by law for one of those reasons:

  * To respond to any questions or complaints;
  * To show that we treated you fairly;
  * To maintain records according to rules that apply to us;
  * To comply with obligations that we may have at law;
  * In order to protect our legitimate interests, in which case we make sure that this does not override your fundamental privacy rights at law.


* ### Your rights

You have various rights in relation to your personal data. In particular, you have a right to:

  * obtain confirmation that we are processing your personal data and request a copy of the personal data we hold about you;
