<p><em>Time Out</em> London ("TOL") has always promised to serve its audience with integrity and honesty. The same is true now that we publish online. TOL has developed this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information-gathering and -sharing practices for <a href="http://www.timeout.com">www.timeout.com</a> (the "site"). By visiting the site, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. Our site will develop and evolve over time, and this policy may change to reflect that. <br><br>
</p>

<p><strong>The TOL privacy promise</strong><br>
We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. We are also committed to the following: (1) We will not pass on any individual user details unless we have your prior consent; and (2) if we donï¿½t have your consent to pass on individual user details, we will only give advertisers aggregate statistics about the number of users and their traffic patterns. However, if TOL changes hands, TOL reserves the right to transfer all information collected through this site to the new owner.<br><br>
</p>

<p><strong>Personal information</strong><br>
TOL does not require you to provide any personal information in order to access the site www.timeout.com. However, if you choose to fill out any reader surveys, or subscribe to our paid for sites <a href="http://eatdrink.timeout.com">eatdrink.timeout.com</a>, <a href="/film">timeout.com/film</a>, <a href="/classifieds">timeout.com/classifieds</a>, <a href="/forum">timeout.com/classifieds</a>, or our <a href="/shop/">online shop</a>  you will be asked to supply some information about yourself, including your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. TOL keeps track of the number of visitors to the site, the pages they visit and how long they stay. In addition, TOL collects information from visitors who click on advertisements so that we are able to measure interest in the various areas of our site and inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their ads. TOL also uses demographic and preference information to allow advertising banners on our site to be targeted, in the aggregate, to the readers for whom they are most pertinent. <br><br>
We collect these kinds of aggregate user information for two main reasons: (1) to help us continually improve the service we offer; and (2) to sell sponsorships on the site to appropriate advertisers. TOL discloses this information to advertisers. Note that advertisers do not have influence over the editorial content or reviews that appear on the site. <br><br>
</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and <em>Time Out</em></strong></p>
Time Out London's main site at <a href="http://www.timeout.com">www.timeout.com</a> and our other sites use cookies to track your usage on our site.

Such requests will be opt-in only, so that you do not inadvertently agree to receive mailings you do not want.<br><br>
If you purchase a subscription to Eating &amp; Drinking Online, or participate in an online survey, you may receive a one-time mailing to confirm your transaction or interaction with our site. Such mailings are one-time only. When you give us your e-mail address under these circumstances, you will also see a box that, when checked by you, will enable TOL to contact you via e-mail regarding special events, discounts and offers. If you don't want your information to be used for any of these purposes, you should not check the box. <br><br>
If we ever request that you volunteer additional information, such as financial data or ageï¿½in an online survey, for exampleï¿½your response will always be voluntary. In addition, there will always be a box for you to check if you choose to enable us to disclose such information to a third party.<br><br>
Users may opt to receive a regular e-mail newsletter that contains information we believe to be of value to our users, specifically special discounts and offers selected by our marketing department. <br><br>
</p>

3. On occasion, TOL sponsors special promotions, sweepstakes and contests that are hosted by partner websites, which may require that your browser accept cookies. <br><br>
5. Required disclosures: TOL cooperates with all law-enforcement inquiries and reserves the right to disclose personally identifying or aggregate information in connection with a subpoena or other court-sanctioned demand for such information.<br><br>
</p>

TOL has invested, and will continue to invest, in the best-quality security available to guard access to information, data quality, and physical security of servers where information is stored. Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
