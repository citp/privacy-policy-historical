The PPWE product offering provides an “opt-in” option for Subscribers and their associated Users to receive further information from TimeTrade and third parties.

Users and Subscribers can opt-out of receiving such information at any time by unsubscribing to the marketing emails via the unsubscribe links presented in the email. PurchasePath Subscriber data is not used or included in any TimeTrade or third party marketing programs.

The TimeTrade applications collect data in order to schedule services on behalf of Subscribers. As a function of the application, Subscribers may customize the data that is collected from Users. Typically, the data collected is: First & Last Name, Email Address and Telephone number.
