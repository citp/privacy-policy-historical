Please direct any questions that you may have regarding our Privacy Statement at any time to our privacy coordinator at privacy@timetrade.com.

**Personally-identifiable Information**

When you register to use our products and services, we gather some information about you such as your name, business type or occupation, email address, credit card, and billing address information. We request this information so that we may register and bill you for our service, and customize our application to meet the specific needs of your business or profession. In addition, we give you the option to receive information from TimeTrade and third parties.

If you sign up for our mailing list, we will share your name and email address (with your permission) with selected partners so that they may contact you regarding special offers that may be of interest to you. By collecting some information about you, we are able to deliver more relevant information and offers to you. You can opt-out of receiving information at any time by logging into your TimeTrade account and changing the appropriate settings in the account administration wizard. TimeTrade may disclose or access account information in the event the law requires such disclosure and for administrative or related purposes to maintain and improve our services to you. TimeTrade will never share personally-identifiable information about you or your business with any third party without receiving your permission, unless required to do so by law.

**Non-Personally-Identifiable Information Automatically Collected**

At times, we may collect information about you that is not personally-identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Web site and/or Internet Service Provider from which you linked to our site. In addition, we may collect user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners. This information is provided in the aggregate only and will not include any personally identifiable information about any individual users.

**Cookies**

**Scheduling & Appointment Confidentiality**

TimeTrade never shares a service provider's schedule with anyone. For persons scheduling appointments with a service provider, TimeTrade will not share their personal schedule information with anyone except the service provider with whom they make an appointment. All scheduling and appointment information will be confidential. Each service provider can view only information relating to his or her appointments.

TimeTrade also holds your customer and employee information in strictest confidence. However, certain of your customers may choose to receive information from TimeTrade and third parties by an opt-in election.

**Children**

Children should request permission from their parent or guardian prior to sending personal information online. TimeTrade does not intend to collect any personally-identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13. If a child has provided TimeTrade with personally-identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child should contact us if they would like such information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's personally-identifiable information from the existing files.

**Security**

Our Web site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alternation of the information under our control. These security measures include state-of-the-art firewall, physical protection in our data center, and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to protect your financial data during transactions.

**Credit Card Transactions**

Credit card transactions are processed by Cybercash which has confidentiality of transactions covered by their privacy policy. A professional payment authorization service was chosen for added security. Cybercash offers secure encrypted credit card transactions for thousands of companies and has stringent security measures in place.
