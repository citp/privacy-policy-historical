 **2\. Use of Information Gathered by TimeTrade During Registration For Services or Other General Inquiries.**   
When you visit TimeTrade’s website for information regarding our products, promotions, employment opportunities or to register to use TimeTrade’s services, TimeTrade may gather information about you such as your name, business type, contact information, email address, payment method, and billing address information. If you disclose any personal data to us, you consent to our processing and use of such personal data in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

Unless permission is provided through our Opt-in process, we will not sell or rent your personal information to any third party or use your e-mail address for unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by TimeTrade will only be in connection with the provision of agreed services, products or inquiries.

 **3\. Sharing of Collected Information, “Opt-in”**   
The SMB product offering provides an “opt-in” option for Subscribers and their associated Users to receive further information from TimeTrade and third parties. If the User or Subscriber opts-in, TimeTrade may share names and email addresses with selected partners so that such partners may contact them with offers that may be of interest to them. Users and Subscribers can opt-out of receiving such information at any time by unsubscribing to the marketing emails via the unsubscribe links presented in the email. Scheduler for Enterprise Subscriber data is not used or included in any TimeTrade or third party marketing programs.

 **4\. Credit Card Transactions**   
Online credit card payments related to SMB subscriptions are processed by a PCI certified payment processing vendor utilizing secure, encrypted payment card processing methods. Financial information will not be shared with any party not directly involved with billing of the services.

 **5\. Use of Information**   
The functionality of the TimeTrade services allows Subscribers to collect information from a User for the scheduling of an appointment with the Subscriber. As a function of the services, Subscribers may customize the data that is collected from Users. Typically, the data collected is: First & Last Name, Email Address and Telephone number. Pursuant to best practices and privacy regulations, Subscribers should limit the amount of personally identifiable information collected to only that which is strictly necessary. A Subscriber should never ask for, and a User should never provide, sensitive information such as a credit card number or government identification number via the TimeTrade services.

Except as specified elsewhere in this Policy Statement, TimeTrade considers all User information collected by TimeTrade on behalf of a Subscriber to be the proprietary information of the applicable Subscriber. Accordingly, all User personal information is controlled by the Subscriber and is subject to the Subscriber’s privacy policy and practices, which may differ from this policy.

TimeTrade will retain the information collected by our Subscribers until the User or Subscriber requests its removal or the Subscriber terminates its relationship with TimeTrade. In either case TimeTrade will modify the collected data to be unreadable and unrecoverable. TimeTrade employees may periodically access Subscriber data solely for administrative purposes, application support, or to improve systems efficiency and add enhancements.

TimeTrade uses third-party service providers who work on our behalf and who are bound by contract to keep all information confidential and use the information solely to carry out the services that they are performing for us. For example, TimeTrade uses third party service providers to assist with the following: Hosting of the application servers and collected data and sending appointment confirmations, reminder e-mails and text/SMS messages.

If required by law, TimeTrade may access or disclose information collected by our systems on behalf of a Subscriber, to appropriate authorities. Unless otherwise prohibited, a disclosure request shall be promptly communicated to the Subscriber, i.e. data owner.

 **6\. Scheduling & Appointment Confidentiality**   
TimeTrade internally classifies all scheduling and appointment information as confidential and proprietary to the Subscriber. TimeTrade will never share a Subscriber’s schedule or appointment data with any third party outside the scope of TimeTrade’s services.

For user experience, analytical and support purposes, TimeTrade may record Subscriber User session-specific information, such as source IP, accessing browser and which pages or functions within the application were accessed. For Users scheduling appointments with a Subscriber, TimeTrade will not share their scheduling information with anyone except the Subscriber with whom they are making an appointment. A Subscriber can only view information relating to their instance of services.

 **7\. Links to Other Websites**   
Other websites and applications not under the direct control of TimeTrade are not governed by this Privacy Statement. Emails generated by Subscribers as part of the TimeTrade services may contain links to enable Users to visit other websites. Be aware that TimeTrade does not have any control over the target website and cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that a User provides while visiting them. Caution should be exercised when visiting unknown websites, and the privacy statement applicable to the website in question should be reviewed prior to use.
