# Privacy Policy – Tim's Printables

Dutch Renaissance Press LLC is deeply committed to your right to privacy and takes your privacy seriously. We have very strict privacy policies and we strive to keep your personal and financial information secure.

This Privacy Policy covers Dutch Renaissance Press’s treatment of personally identifiable information that Dutch Renaissance Press collects when you are on www.timvandevall.com, and when you use Dutch Renaissance Press’s services.

We will NEVER sell or rent your name, e-mail address or personal information to any third party except to fulfill your order, unless specifically authorized by you. Only authorized personnel may access your information. All employees are required to adhere to our strict privacy policies and any employee who violates the privacy policy is subject to termination and other disciplinary measures, up to being criminally prosecuted for their violation.

**Traffic Data and Information**  
Dutch Renaissance Press utilizes a number of internal and third party methods to recognize visitor data such as IP addresses and browser settings (Collectively ‘Visitor Data’). Dutch Renaissance Press’s internal servers and software automatically recognizes Visitor Data. No Personal Identifiable Information (as defined below) is revealed in this process. The Site may also use such Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the kind and types of visitors that use the web site at specific intervals (Collectively ‘Traffic Data’).

From time to time, Dutch Renaissance Press may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third party providers as well as employ internally developed cookies and tracking code which allows Dutch Renaissance Press to store a small piece of data on a visitor’s computer about the visit to the www.timvandevall.com web site. Personally Identifiable Information is not captured in such cookies, nor does Dutch Renaissance Press use cookies to mine Personally Identifiable Information.

We may use Traffic Data information to analyze our Web site Traffic but such information is not examined for Personally Identifiable Information. We may also use such Traffic Data to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and Transaction Information may also be shared with business partners, affiliates, and/or advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.

**Personal Information**  
In order for each customer to access and utilize Dutch Renaissance Press’s products and services, Dutch Renaissance Press requires each customer to provide us with personal information (collectively ‘Personally Identifiable Information’). Personally Identifiable Information is only captured when a visitor signs in to the system and willingly discloses such information in the Personal Profile section of the web site.

Personally Identifiable Information includes, but is not limited to: (i) ‘Contact Data’ (such as your name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number and email address), (ii) ‘Financial Data’ (such as your credit card number, expiration date, and verification code), (iii) ‘Demographic Data’ (such as your zip code and gender), and (iv) other ‘Legal Data’ (such as your social security number, mortgage information, automobile information, personal wedding information, trade secrets, invention and/or idea submissions and other sensitive information necessary to generate proper legal documents).

Please be advised that certain personal information becomes public record upon the filing of documents with the state or the court. For example, the corporate name, business address and the name of the registered agent become public information upon the filing of articles of incorporation. In many cases, the Secretary of State will provide this information to third parties for a fee. The US Patent and Trademark Office will also make public the names and addresses of trademark registrants. In some states, fictitious business names, including the name and address of the business owner, must be published in a newspaper. Dutch Renaissance Press’s privacy policy does not cover actions by these third parties.

**Use of Personal Information**

Dutch Renaissance Press, sometimes with third party assistance, may use your Personally Identifiable Information to verify your identity and process your order and payment through merchant account services, and to analyze our customer demographics to better serve you.

We do not sell or rent Personally Identifiable Information to third parties, except as necessary to provide you with the services we offer. We may also provide it to a third party if we receive a subpoena or otherwise to comply with the law.

Please note that Contact Data and Traffic Data is used to gather general statistics regarding our customers and visitors respectively, in order to enhance the consumer experience on the web site. We may also use demographic data in a manner that does not identify you specifically or allow you to be contacted but does identify certain criteria about our users in general. For example, we may inform third parties about the number of registered users, number of unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.

We also use Contact Data such as name, physical address and email address to provide special information and promotions regarding our products or in order to contact a customer regarding an order.

Opting Out. You may choose not to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information. In this case, you may be able to visit the web site, and browse the Education Center and Articles Pages; however, we cannot process an order without such information.
