                <strong>Your Privacy</strong>
                <br>
                TimeOffManager, ("TimeOffManager", "us" or "we"), has created this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") in order to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices. We understand the importance that Internet users place on privacy and have designed our website with this in mind. We are also committed in protecting your privacy. We only use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide support and upgrades for our products. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

                <br><br>
                <strong>What information do we collect?</strong>
                <br>
                When you register on our website in order to create an account, we collect information from you. When registering on our website, as appropriate, you may be asked to provide the following: company name, e-mail address, mailing address, website, name, and title/position. This allows us to process and create your account and to notify you via email about all time-off requests submitted by your employees.

                <br><br>
                <strong>What do we use your information for?</strong>
                <br>
                Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
                <br><br>
                - To process transactions<br>Your information will not be sold, transferred, exchanged, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased service requested by the customer.

                <strong>How do we protect customer information?</strong><br>
                We use a Secure Server for collecting personal and credit card information. The secure server layer (SSL) encrypts all of the information you enter before it is transmitted over the internet and sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. Along with using Secure Server, we also implement various security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you access your personal information.
                <br><br>
                <strong>What about "cookies"?</strong><br>
                "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to save your companyID, username and password so that you do not have to re-enter it each time that you visit our Website (if you choose).
                <br><br>
                <strong>Will we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</strong><br>
                We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.  This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of TimeOffManager, our users, or others.
                <br><br>
