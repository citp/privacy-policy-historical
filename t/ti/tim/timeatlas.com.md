# Privacy Policy - …linking technology and productivity for Windows users

This privacy statement covers the practices used for [WWW.TIMEATLAS.COM](http://www.timeatlas.com/).

If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please [email](http://www.timeatlas.com/mos/component/contact/) us.

### _Information Collection and Use_

_**Information Collection**_

Productivity Portfolio is the sole owner of the information collected on WWW.TIMEATLAS.COM. Productivity Portfolio collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

_**Website Membership**_

In order to become a member, a user must first complete the member form. During this process a user is required to give contact information such as name and email address. If a user cancels or opts not to renew their membership, the email address and username are removed from our system.

_**Orders**_

Our payment processor, PayPal, requests additional information from the subscriber. A user must provide contact information (such as name and email) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. **We do not have access to your PayPal financial data.**

### _Information Use_

### _**Cookies**_

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Without this cookie, a member will only see those articles which are coded for all users. Members also have the option of having the system remember their login. The system will create two persistant cookies, one which contains the username and the other the user password. Each cookie will expire one year from the date of creation. In addition to these optional cookies, a session cookie is also creation for all users. This cookie does not include any persoanl information.

_**Log Files**_

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

### _Sharing_

_**Legal Disclaimer**_

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

_**Service Providers**_

We use several third parties to provide specific content and ads. These third parties do not have access to any user information.

### _**Links**_

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

###   
**_Email-A-Friend_**

If a user elects to use our referral service by emailing a friend an article link, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Productivity Portfolio will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Productivity Portfolio uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friends email address is not retained. 

### _Security_

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. We have chosen a payment vendor that utilizes SSL. When the order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software by our payment vendor. While on a secure page, such as the payment form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked.

While we require our payment vendor to use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job or service are granted access to personally identifiable information.

###   
_Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information_

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as email address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing our [Customer Support](http://www.timeatlas.com/mos/component/contact/).

_**Notification of Changes**_

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
