# Privacy Policy

This privacy statement covers the practices used for [WWW.TIMEATLAS.COM](http://www.timeatlas.com/).

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please [email](http://www.timeatlas.com/mos/component/contact/) us.

### Information Collection and Use

_**Information Collection**_

Productivity Portfolio is the sole owner of the information collected on WWW.TIMEATLAS.COM. Productivity Portfolio collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

_**Orders**_

Some of our written content may be sold such as specific research reports. Our payment processor, PayPal, requests additional information from each purchaser. You must provide contact information (such as name and email) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill the order. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact you. **We do not have access to your PayPal financial data.**

_**Weekly Email Updates**_

We also use the services of Zookoda to deliver our weekly email updates. Although we initiate the updates, the subscriber's email addresses are kept on their secure servers. A user may unsubscribe from the service by clicking the link on the update emails. We also have the ability to remove an email subscriber if needed.

### Information Use

_**Cookies**_

A cookie is a small piece of data stored on your computer from our website. These cookies are created by our content management system. Although we no longer use a paid membership model, the content management system still has a membership model. For example, as the site administrator, I still have a login and password. We also wrote an [article on browser cookie basics and their uses on the web](http://www.timeatlas.com/mos/Term_to_Learn/General/Browser_Cookie_Basics/ "Basic article defining what are browser cookies") if you want more information.   


Our system will also set cookies based on your preferences. For example, our template allows you to change your font size and screen width. These items are controlled by cookies. If you delete these cookies, you will have to reset your preferences.

We're also experimenting with various affiliates who may set their own cookies. These ads generally appear on the right side of a page, but that may change. The affiliates and location may change based on their performance. The purpose of these cookies is to identify timeatlas.com as the referring source so I'm properly compensated if you decide to purchase their products. In other words, I'm indirectly paid by these people.   


Periodically, we show affiliate ads for: Audible, FranklinCovey, Rosetta Software , Stamps.com and Staples. 

## If you use Firefox, you can view the contents for the cookies our site sets.

1\. From the **Tools** menu, select **Options**   
2\. On the Options dialog, click the **Privacy** icon at the top.   
3\. Click the **Cookies** tab   
4\. Click the **View Cookies** button   
5\. Click the **+** sign next to timeatlas.com   
6\. Highlight any cookie to see its contents

If you're an Internet Explorer user, you can manage your cookies through a freeware application called IECookiesView from Nir Sofer.

<http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/iecookies.html>

If you go through this review process, you will see we have one cookie that expires in 32 years. We haven't a clue as to why our CMS system sets one for so long. I mean...who the heck is going to be using the same PC for that many years? I'm lucky if I can get a keyboard to last that long.

_**Log Files**_

Like most websites, our server creates log files. This file includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

As you probably guessed, the above paragraph was lifted from one of those "best practices" privacy policies. Pretty boring and sterile so I've added some more info below. Somebody must be making money off the word "aggregate".   


Our server log files are kept in several places. The current version is kept by our web hosting company. Typically, we download this file several times a week to our local machine for analysis. Two months of log files are maintained on our web hosting server and the older versions are deleted. We have been keeping copies on our local machine for upwards of a year so we can see longer term trends. These files are also encrypted and backed up to a 3rd party site.

You can see a good idea of the type of information we see and how we use this data in the article we wrote called, [Annual Report on Your Data and our Server Logs](http://www.timeatlas.com/mos/The_News/Security/Annual_Report_on_Your_Data_and_our_Server_Logs/).

This is also an area where we try different programs. If you have your own site you probably know the ordeal of analysis. When we wrote the article above, we were testing WebLog expert. Presently, we're using ClickTracks and Google Analytics. If you have any concerns or questions, please let me know.

### Sharing

_**Legal Disclaimer** _

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

_**Service Providers** _

We use several third party providers to distribute ads and our RSS feed. These third parties do not have access to our user information other than what they may collect.

_**Links** _

This Web site contains numerous links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of the other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site. We like to use [EULAlyzer to capture and evaluate end user license agreements](http://www.timeatlas.com/mos/Useful_Utilities/Free/EULAlyzer_Jump_Starts_the_Review_Process/ "Product review of EULAlyzer") and privacy policies.   


**_Email-A-Friend_**

If you elect to use our referral service by emailing a friend an article link, we ask you for the friend's name and email address. Productivity Portfolio will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Productivity Portfolio uses this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend's email address is not stored. 

### Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect your information. We have chosen a payment vendor that utilizes SSL. When a product order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software by our payment vendor. While on a secure page, such as the payment form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked.

While we require our payment vendor to use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job or service are granted access to personally identifiable information.

### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.

In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.

If you've read this far down into this document, pat yourself on the back. Too few people read Privacy Policies. And if you're the first to drop me an email using our Contact Us form with the text, "I can't believe I read the whole policy", I'll send you a $10 Amazon gift certificate.
