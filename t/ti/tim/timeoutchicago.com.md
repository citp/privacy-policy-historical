# Privacy policy

Your privacy is important to us. You are visiting a website owned and operated by Time Out America LLC and based in the United States of America. Time Out New York, Time Out Los Angeles, Time Out New York Kids, Time Out Chicago, Time Out Las Vegas, Time Out Miami, Time Out Washington, DC, Time Out Boston, Time Out San Francisco and Time Out USA (together, “Time Out”) have always endeavoured to serve its audience with integrity and honesty. The same is true online. Time Out has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information-gathering and -sharing practices for all US based Time Out sites (together, the “Site”). This Site is also hosting other Time Out Websites providing information about other cities, which fall under this Privacy Policy. By visiting the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Our Site will develop and evolve over time, and this Privacy Policy may change to reflect that. Your continued use of this Site following reasonable notice of any such changes means you accept the changes. You agree that notices we may provide on the Site itself shall be deemed reasonable notice for this purpose. It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we may make to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 1, 2014.

In addition, Time Out supports the Consumer Reports WebWatch guidelines to promote credible information practices on the web. For more information, [click here](http://consumersunion.org/news/consumer-reports-webwatch-guidelines/).

**1\. Collected and Disclosed Information**

A. Time Out may request information from you in order to grant you access to selected content of our Site. Time Out may use this information to contact you regarding your relationship with the Site and to provide services that you have requested. Time Out may share your information with vendors we select as necessary to provide products or services you have requested or to provide information about products or services that may be of interest to you.

B. For example, Time Out subscriptions are managed by CDS Global. (“CDS”). Whether you have subscribed to the magazine via phone, mail or online, your account information can be accessed via CDS’s web site through links from our Site. New subscribers link from our Site to CDS’s web site to sign up for a subscription via a secure server. In addition, Time Out may make available the names and mailing addresses of our magazine subscribers to carefully screened third-party organizations whose products and services might prove interesting to you. If you do not wish to receive mailings from such organizations, please let us know by writing to [Time Out New York, P.O. Box 385, Mt. Morris, IL 61054-0385.]

C. Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, your personal information will not be used for promotional purposes without your consent. However, if you choose to fill out any reader surveys, or participate in a contest, demographic information that you submit about yourself may be shared with associated sponsors and business partners in aggregate form.

D. Information collected in aggregate form includes the number of visitors to the Site, the pages they visit, and how long they stay. We collect these kinds of aggregate user information to help us continually improve our services and to sell sponsorships on the Site to appropriate advertisers. Time Out discloses this aggregate user information to advertisers. Note that advertisers do not have any influence over the editorial content or reviews that appear on the Site. In addition, Time Out collects information from visitors who click on advertisements so that we are able to measure interest in the various areas of our Site and inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their ads. Time Out also uses demographic and preference information only in aggregate form to allow advertising banners on our Site to be targeted to the readers for whom they are most pertinent.

E. Time Out cooperates with all law-enforcement inquiries, official investigations and legal proceedings initiated by governmental and/or law enforcement officials, as well as private parties, and reserves the right to disclose personally identifying and/or aggregate information in connection with a subpoena or other court-sanctioned demand for such information.

F. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is meant to impede Time Out’s right or ability to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets. Time Out reserves the right to share your information with any successor to Time Out’s business.

G. We reserve the right to access, use and share with others your personally identifiable information for purposes of health, safety and other matters in the public interest. In addition, we reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, mobile or other device (including its geographical location), which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including, without limitation, to help diagnosis problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, analyze trends, track users' movements around our Site and to otherwise administer our Site. Geographic location information about you and/or your computer, mobile or other device may specifically be used to show you content and sponsored messaging based on geographic location. We reserve the right to use, transfer, sell and share aggregated unanimous data about our users as a group for any lawful business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers, sponsors, clients and customers.

**2\. IP Addresses; Cookies and Other Tracking Technology**

A. Time Out logs IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use the IP address log in an aggregate fashion to track access to our Site.

B. As is standard practice on many web sites, the Site uses “cookies” and other similar technologies such as clear gifs (collectively "Local Device Storage") to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand which parts of our Site are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We reserve the right to place cookies on your computer with unique anonymous numbers for purposes such as to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad or visited a particular web page. You may decline Local Device Storage by using the appropriate feature of your web software, if available; however, declining to use Local Device Storage may impede the ability of the Site to function properly.

C. In addition, we use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our Site. This company may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number) about your visit to this Site, including IP address, in order to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this Site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by this company,  [please click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/).

D. In addition to Local Device Storage, we may use web beacons, web bugs and similar technologies (collectively, together with Local Device Storage, the "Tracking Technologies"). We use Tracking Technologies for all or some of the same lawful business purposes we described above for the use of Local Device Storage.

**3\. User Generated Content (Message Boards, Forums, Reader Reviews and Chats)**

Please remember that any personal information you disclose in the message boards, forums, reader reviews, and chats becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. If you send us e-mails, you should be aware that information disclosed in e-mails may not be secure or encrypted and, thus, may be available to others. We suggest that you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information in e-mails or via the Internet.

**4\. E-mails**

We will use your e-mail address to respond directly to your questions or comments. Except to provide you with products and services you have requested, we will not share, sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your e-mail address without providing you the opportunity to opt-out of such use. If we ever request that you volunteer additional information, such as age (e.g., in an online survey), your response will always be voluntary. You can unsubscribe to any e-mail you receive from Time Out by following the instructions in the e-mail. If you feel you have received an e-mail from us in error, please contact  [[privacy@timeout.com](mailto:privacy@timeout.com)].

This includes order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, notices of credit-card problems, other transactional e-mails and notifications about major changes to our Site and/or to our Privacy Policy. If you have registered for online discussions or other services, you may receive e-mails specific to your participation in those activities.

(b) e-Newsletters: Time Out offers several e-mail newsletters (“e-Newsletters”). When you subscribe to our magazines and give us your e-mail address, you will automatically receive our e-Newsletter. You can opt out of this at any point by following the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the e-mail or by e-mailing [[privacy@timeout.com](mailto:privacy@timeout.com)].

Online users who are otherwise not subscribers of our magazines may opt to receive a regular e-Newsletter that contains information we believe to be of value to our users, specifically special discounts and offers selected by our marketing department and provided by our advertisers. We respect that your receiving the e-Newsletter is a choice, and you may choose to remove your name from the list at any time by following the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the e-mail or by e-mailing [[privacy@timeout.com](mailto:privacy@timeout.com)].

By subscribing to our magazines and/or receiving the Time Out e-Newsletter, you also agree to receive editorial previews, and details about special offers and discounts from commercial participants by e-mail on a regular basis. Time Out is not responsible for the satisfaction of the special offers and discounts as announced in the e-Newsletter. If for any reason you are not satisfied with an offer or discount, contact the commercial participant making the offer. You agree that Time Out will not be liable to you for anything connected with your participation in the e-Newsletter Program.

(c) Promotional E-mail: Certain parts of the Site may give you the option to receive periodic e-mails from Time Out about products and services that we think may be of interest to you. If you opt-in to receive these e-mails, you can choose not to receive additional messages in the future by following the instructions in the e-mails.

Working from time to time with a specific sponsor (or sponsors), Time Out may create stand-alone promotional web sites for the purpose of collecting sweepstakes registrations. In these instances it will be communicated to registrants via opt-in that their contact information will be shared by Time Out with the sponsor (or sponsors) for the purpose of sending marketing e-mails. By opting into these promotional web sites, you will also be opting-in to receive weekly e-Newsletters.

(d) Survey E-mail: We may send you an e-mail inviting you to participate in user surveys, asking for feedback on our Site and existing or prospective products and services, as well as information to better understand our users. User surveys greatly help us to improve our Site, and any information we obtain in such surveys will not be shared with third parties, except in aggregate form.

**5\. Social Networking Service**

If you choose to access, visit and/or use any third-party social networking service(s) that may be integrated with our Site, we may receive personally identifiable information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device that you may have made available to those services, including information about your contacts on those services. For example, some social networking services allow you to push content from our Site to your contacts or to pool information about your contacts so you can connect with them on or through our Site. Some social networking services also will facilitate your registration for our Site or enhance or personalize your experience on our Site. Your decision to use a social networking service in connection with our Site is voluntary. However, you should make sure you are comfortable with the information your third-party social networking services may make available to our Site by visiting those service(s) privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy setting directly with those services. We reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share and provide access to all personally identifiable information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device that we receive through third-party social networking services in the same ways described in this Privacy Policy as all of your other information.

**6\. Third-Party Web Sites**

Our Site contains links to other web sites that are not under our control, even though some of them may feature the Time Out logo through a marketing agreement with us. Time Out cannot be held responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline and online sites, applications, destinations or services linked to or from our Site. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any web site you visit. Time Out may receive a commission from member transactions on these partner sites. Without limiting the foregoing, the Time Out restaurant reservations section is operated by OpenTable. OpenTable’s privacy policy, viewable at <http://opentable.com/info/helpindex.asp>, governs the use of personal information you provide at the OpenTable site. Time Out receives a commission for transactions processed via this Site. In addition, links within the Time Out Store, and elsewhere on the Site, may link to online retailers including Amazon.com, bn.com and booksense.com which handle the orders and distribution.

On occasion, Time Out sponsors special promotions, sweepstakes, and contests that are hosted by partner web sites, which may require that your browser accept cookies, or that you agree to receive information from such sponsors. Such requirements are clearly noted.

**7\. Security**

Time Out has invested, and will continue to invest, in high-quality security measures designed to guard access to information, data quality, and physical security of servers where information is stored. Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control and uses encryption technology where appropriate. We cannot, however, guarantee the confidentiality of any communication transmitted to or from Time Out via the Site or e-mails. Accordingly, Time Out is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.

**8\. Collection of Personal Data from Children**

Our Site is not directed to users under the age of 18.

**10\. Transfer of Information**

Your information may be transferred to and maintained on, servers and databases located outside of your state, providence, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as your jurisdiction. Please be advised that we may transfer your information to and from any state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction, and process it in the United States or elsewhere. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to any such transfer.

**11\. Information Security and Notification**

A. Because no data transmission is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, we cannot guaranty the security of the information you sent to us or the security of our servers, networks or databases, and by using our Site, you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you access, visit and/or use the site and/or use our Site, including, without limitation, your personally identifiable information, and we are not responsible for any loss of such information or the consequences thereof.

Moreover, if you elect to store information, such as your personally identifiable information where others may access it, we are not responsible for any loss of such information or the consequences thereof. If you lose a computer, mobile or other device or it is stolen, that contains your personally identifiable information, it is up to you to take all the steps necessary to protect yourself.

C. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you via your computer, mobile or other device.
