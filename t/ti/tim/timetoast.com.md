# Privacy Policy | Timetoast timelines

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Timetoast collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Timetoast’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Timetoast’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Timetoast may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Timetoast also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Timetoast does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Timetoast’s websites choose to interact with Timetoast in ways that require Timetoast to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Timetoast gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a timeline at [Timetoast.com](http://www.timetoast.com/) to provide a username and email address.

## Aggregated Statistics

Timetoast may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Timetoast may monitor the most popular timelines on the Timetoast.com site. Timetoast may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Timetoast does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Timetoast discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Timetoast’s behalf or to provide services available at Timetoast’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Timetoast’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Timetoast will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Timetoast discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Timetoast believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Timetoast, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Timetoast website and have supplied your email address, Timetoast may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Timetoast and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Timetoast takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Timetoast uses cookies to help Timetoast identify and track visitors, their usage of Timetoast website, and their website access preferences. Timetoast visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Timetoast’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Timetoast’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Timetoast may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Timetoast’s sole discretion. Timetoast encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Timetoast.com account, you should also check the 'your timelines' dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
