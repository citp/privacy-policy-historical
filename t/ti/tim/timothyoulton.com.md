**Cookies**

Our websites use “cookies” which are small data files that are stored on your computer when you visit a website and which enable us to distinguish you from other users of our website. Cookies enable you to shop on our websites and may be used in a variety of ways to enhance or personalize your online browsing and shopping experience.

Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us. You can choose to accept or decline cookies.

You can set your browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to access your account information or make purchases on our websites. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

Once you agree to the cookies, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.

**What we do with the information we gather**

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

  * To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information, products or services that you request from us;
  * For the specific purpose for which it was volunteered (for example, to register a product warranty, to answer an e-mail, etc.);
  * To provide you with information about other goods and services we offer that are similar to those that you have already;
  * For internal record keeping;
  * To improve our site to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;
  * To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so;
  * As part of our efforts to keep our site safe and secure;
  * To measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you;
  * To make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of our site about goods or services that may interest you or them;
  * To improve the content, appearance and utility of our websites; our product; or services;
  * To track our visitor use of our websites for internal market research; and
  * To notify our visitors of updates to the websites or of new products, special offers, changes to our service, or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided.



In addition, our web servers may automatically recognize information regarding your domain name (or that of your access provider) and e-mail address, and we may use this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. We will only retain your information for a reasonable period or for so long as either you or legislation permits.

From time to time, we may contract with companies or persons, whose privacy practices are consistent with ours, to provide certain services including credit card processing, shipping, data management, promotional services, etc. We may provide these providers with the information needed for them to perform these services. In addition, we may use third-party advertising companies to serve or track ads on our website and other websites. These companies may use anonymized information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use or disclosure of your information.
