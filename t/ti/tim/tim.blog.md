### 2\. Your Consent To This Privacy Policy

You indicate your consent to the terms of this privacy policy in different ways, depending on your relationship to the Platform. The procedures for consenting to this privacy policy are less formal if you are a Website visitor and more formal if you are, or are seeking to become, a participating user.

**2.1  ** **Consent by Website Visitors**. We have structured our Website so that, as a casual Website visitor, you are able to come to our Website and review selected information about our Services without providing us with any Personally Identifiable Information. By accessing and using our Platform as a visitor, you are acknowledging that you have read and understood this privacy policy and agree to be legally bound by it.

**2.2  ** **Consent by Participating Users**. In order to receive Tim’s email newsletter, and participate in certain of our other Services (such as providing public comments via the website), you must (a) complete the registration process at our Platform (which consists primarily of providing your email address and, optionally, your name); (b) be age 18 or older; and (c) indicate your consent to this privacy policy in the manner we specify during the registration process.

**2.3  ** **Right to Withdraw Consent**. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, in accordance with Section 11 (Your Right To Opt-Out, Object To Processing, And Delete Information).

### 3\. The Information We Collect

Our Platform gives Tim opportunities to communicate with people interested in his blog, podcasts, books, TV shows, and his other activities and interests. The Platform also provides you with opportunities to participate in exchanges on these topics, and to receive additional information on all of the above. To provide these Services, and to otherwise conduct our business via the Platform, we rely on information provided by and collected from our users. This information consists of the following:

**3.1  ** **Personally Identifiable Information**. We collect certain information that identifies you as an individual (collectively, “ **Personally Identifiable Information** ”). The only Personally Identifiable Information we collect is your email address. We give you the option to provide us with your name, but you do not need to give us your name in order to receive the Services.

**3.2  ** **Non-Personally Identifiable Information**. We also collect technical and device-related information that is not Personally Identifiable Information, but instead identifies or may reasonably be used to identify a particular user device (collectively, “ **Non-Personally Identifiable Information** ”). Non-Personally Identifiable Information is typically collected automatically by technical means, and for purposes of our Platform consists of the following:

  * Device identifiers, such as cookies;
  * Device information, such as hardware and software settings;
  * IP addresses and log information, such as your device’s name, the type and version of your web browser, and referrer addresses that can function to identify a user device; and
  * Tracking information that we collect, or that third parties collect.



**3.3  ** **Anonymous Information**. Our Platform also collects, processes, and/or uses information that does not identify you or your devices, including Personally Identifiable Information that has been made anonymous by: (i) removing identifying fields and aggregating the information with other information so that individual subjects of the information cannot be re-identified, or (ii) anonymizing the information with techniques that remove or perturb the identifying data so as to prevent re-identification of the anonymized information (collectively, “ **Anonymous Information** ”). Information that meets these criteria might include, for example, demographic information, statistical information (e.g. page views and hit counts), and general tracking information.

If we combine Non-Personally Identifiable Information or Anonymous Information with Personally Identifiable Information, we treat the resulting combination as Personally Identifiable Information.

### 4\. How We Collect This Information

We collect the above information through the following means and technologies:

**4.1 Registration.** In order to provide you with the Services, we need to collect Personally Identifiable Information consisting of your email address. Accordingly, when you register to receive the Services, you provide this Personally Identifiable Information.

**4.2 User-Generated Content.** We give you the ability through the Platform to engage with Tim and others in public exchanges, and these include opportunities for you to provide comments, reviews, recommendations, and other input via the Platform (collectively, “User-Generated Content” or “UGC”). Please understand that, if you include Personally Identifiable Information in User-Generated Content, others will be able to read, collect, re-publish, and otherwise freely use the Information. We are not responsible for Personally Identifiable Information you decide to include in UGC, and we will not take down, remove, or edit User-Generated Content, except as required by Applicable Law. If you include in your User-Generated Content any Personally Identifiable Information relating to others, you represent that you have full permission and authority to do so.

**4.3 Contests, Special Offers, and Surveys.** On occasion, we will provide you with the opportunity to participate in a contests, receive a special offer, or provide us with feedback via a survey. To make these Services available to you, we will use the email address and name you provided us when you registered (as set out in Section 2.2 (Consent by Participating Users)).

**4.4 Beacons and Tags.** The Platform may use certain data collection technologies that rely on (i) beacons; (ii) pixel tags and object hyperlinking tags, and (iii) other means to link an object to an Internet address, a remote software application, a remote database, or other remote means of receiving or processing information. We may use these technologies to tell us what parts of our Platform have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches that users perform on our Platform. These technologies also enable us to send email messages in a format users can efficiently read, to learn whether these email messages have been opened, and to help ensure, for example, that our messages are of interest to our users. These technologies provide us with Anonymous Information, Non-Personally Identifiable Information and, in certain instances, Personally Identifiable Information.

**4.5 Device Identifiers; Logs; IP Addresses.** To determine whether your device is supported by our Platform, we may collect certain information about your device and network, including your IP address, your operating system and browser, your device model, information about the your use of the Platform, as well as the presence of any software that our Platform may require to operate with your device, or other third party software or mobile apps on your device. We automatically receive and record this information in log files, and this is generally Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

**4.6 Cookies.** A cookie is a small amount of data which is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a website upon a future visit. We may include cookies on our Platform and use them to recognize you when you return to our Platform. You may set your browser so that it does not accept cookies; however, you may need to enable cookies on your web browser if you wish to access certain personalized features of our Services. Cookies are a form of Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/> and <https://cookies.insites.com/disable-cookies/> for more information on how you can disable some or all cookies. For more information, please refer to our Cookie Policy available at https://tim.blog/cookie-policy/.

**4.7 Click-Throughs.** We may send email messages or display links that use a “click-through URL” linked to our Platform or to another resource. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the destination website page or other resource. Click-throughs may use and collect Anonymous Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We may track this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our user communications.

**4.8 Advertising Technology.** The Services may include use of banner ads and other vehicles for presenting advertising content, and for serving and/or targeting ads, promotions, and other marketing messages, including through use of user profiles, online behavioral advertising methods, and related technologies. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party service, as discussed in Section 6 (How We Share This Information). An advertiser, as described in Section 6.2 (Third Party Advertising), may place or utilize its own cookie or other identifier on your device, and may use Anonymous Information about your visit to our Platform, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad, as well as applicable Non-Personally Identifiable Information.

**4.9 Other Technologies and Data Sources.** We currently do not augment the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us with data from other third-party sources, such as privately-held marketing or analytics databases. We do not, for example, link your Personally Identifiable Information with third-party demographic information (such as age, sex, household income, job industry, or job title). If we later choose to use these data sources, or technologies other than those listed above in this Section 4 (How We Collect Your Information), we will treat any information we collect or generate in that manner in full accordance with this privacy policy.
