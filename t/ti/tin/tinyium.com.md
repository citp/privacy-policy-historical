## Data we collect and store

We use cookies to store Non-Personally Identifiable Information (PII) on our advertising pages. The information stored contains tracking information, such as which advertising campaigns you have previously viewed and the frequency of adverts shown.

We store your IP address and browser user-agent information, these are not linked to anything else personally identifiable.

We may take a 'canvas fingerprint' of your browser, as part of our fraud prevention program. This information cannot identify you personally but helps us determine real or bot users.

## What we do with this data

The Non-Personal Information is used by our system to determine what advertising campaigns you have previously viewed on AdFly and how many, how often. This ensures that we do show you more adverts than necessary.

We also use this information for targeting our advertising campaigns. For example, an advertiser pays us for a campaign to be viewed only from Australia, we will use your IP address to determine your country and whether to show you this particular campaign or not.

This data is not sold or shared with any third party.

## Opt out of our interest-based advertising

We currently do not target adverts based on your interests but if we do in the future or you don't want us to store any information collected, please opt-out using the button below.

This button will also opt you out of our canvas fingerprinting anti-fraud technology and our website may not be fully functional due to this.

This will store a single cookie in your browser, you will need to repeat this for all browsers that you use to access AdFly.

## Third Party Polices

We have no control over the information they collect, so you should refer to their individual privacy policies for more information. We do not share or sell your information to your advertisers, any PII information collected by our advertisers must be provided by yourself.
