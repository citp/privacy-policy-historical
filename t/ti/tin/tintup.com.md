TINT's legal basis for collecting and using data, including personal information, as a data controller depends on the specific collection method.

### How TINT Protects Your Information

TINT follows industry best practices to protect personal information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. TINT is concerned with protecting your privacy and data, but cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information or guarantee that your information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any safeguards. When you enter sensitive information (such as login credentials) on a registration or order form, that information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

### International Transfers

The Services are mainly provided from TINT's offices in the United States of America. TINT uses third-party service providers (such as managed hosting providers, card processors, CRM systems, sub-processors of Content and technology partners) to provide the necessary software, networking, infrastructure and other services that TINT uses to operate the Services. These third party providers may process, or store, personal information on servers outside of the EEA.

Whenever TINT transfers personal information from data subjects located in the EEA to a third-party service provider located in a country that has been deemed inadequate, TINT does so with approved legal adequacy mechanisms in place. For any transfers of personal information to the US, TINT relies on either the third-party's registration in the EU-US Privacy Shield or on the implementation of the EU's Standard Contractual Clauses. By using any of the Services or submitting or collecting any personal information via the Services, you authorize TINT and its authorized service partners to use and process data (including any personal information) in these countries.

As a TINT user, you ultimately decide which Social Networks or Third-Party Apps you want the Services to connect with and which Social Networks and/or Third-Party Apps you want to share your data with.
