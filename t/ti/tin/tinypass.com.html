        <h2>TinyPass Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Effective as of March 13, 2011</h3>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>We take your privacy and the privacy of our TinyPass website very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy
    to learn more about how TinyPass LLC ("TinyPass," "we," our," or "us") treats information, including
    personally identifiable information when you visit our website located at http://TinyPass.com (this "Site").
    We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is
    protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments,
    suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at
    support@TinyPass.com or in writing at: TinyPass Privacy Concerns, 105 Hudson Street, Suite 401, New York, NY
    10013.</p>

<p><b>Online Privacy Standards.</b> We follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission's Fair
    Information Practices Principles, currently available at http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm.
</p>

<p><b>What This Policy Covers.</b> This policy covers the ways in which TinyPass treats information, including
    personally identifiable information, which we obtain when you use the TinyPass Service (as defined in our
    Terms of Use *link*). We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to
    identify or contact you in person, such as your real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or
    physical mailing address. Information that we use internally to identify you as a user in our system is not
    considered personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><b>What This Policy Does Not Cover.</b> This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties
    that we do not own or control, such as the practices of Publishers (as defined in our Terms of Use *link*),
    third-party payment processing services, or our business partners and advertisers. In addition, we may
    provide links to other services and on occasion to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites
    operate independently of TinyPass and they have their own privacy and security practices. For your best
    on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to
    them.</p>

<p><b>Types of Users.</b> There are two types of users of the TinyPass Service: Publishers and Viewers.
    Publishers create accounts at http://TinyPass.com, and use the TinyPass Service to make their content
    available to Viewers. Viewers use the TinyPass Service to seamlessly purchase and view content made
    available by Publishers. Viewers may elect to create user accounts if they choose. Unless the context of
    this policy makes clear the type of user (Publisher or Viewer) referenced by the, the term "you," as used in
    this policy, refers to both Publishers and Viewers.</p>
<h4>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</h4>

<p><b>Information Publishers Provide During Account Creation</b></p>

<p><b>Registration Information For Publishers.</b> During the process by which Publishers register for a user
    account, we require that the Publisher provide its name and email address. We will send you an email to
    verify that you are the owner of the provided email address. If you are a Publisher and choose to receive
    payments by check, you will also need to provide your physical mailing address. You will also choose a User
    Name that we will use to identify you in our system. In order to meet "Know-Your-Customer" ("KYC") banking
    mandates or Anti-money-laundering ("AML") legislation or similar purposes), TinyPass may be required to
    request additional information to verify Publisher's compliance with the Terms and Conditions agreed to as
    part of the registration process. For more information, please refer to the Publisher Registration Terms and
    Conditions.</p>

<p><b>Access To Your Personal Information.</b> In general, we make it easy for Publishers to view the personally
    identifiable information we have collected from that Publisher. That information is available at the
    Publisher's user account page, where Publishers can add, edit, or delete such personally identifiable
    information as the Publisher sees fit.</p>
<h4>Optional Information You Provide</h4>

<p><b>Surveys and Contests.</b> Your participation in contests or surveys offered by and through the TinyPass
    Service is entirely optional. Should you choose to participate in a contest or survey, we may collect
    personally identifiable information from you as a condition of that participation. If you do not wish to
    disclose the requested information, please do not participate in the contest or survey for which it is
    required.</p>

<p>Information Provided By Viewers Before Viewing Content</p>

<p>Viewers must provide TinyPass with a valid email address to view content provided through the TinyPass
    Service. In addition, when selecting paid content, Viewers will be presented with the option to establish a
    TinyPass user account or to pay for Publisher Services (as defined in the Terms of Use *link*) on a
    one-time-transaction (e.g., a la carte) basis.</p>

<p>If you choose to create a TinyPass user account, we require that you provide your name and email address. We
    will send you an email to verify that you are the owner of the provided email address. You will also be
    required to provide payment information (e.g., PayPal account information) that can be used to purchase
    content through the TinyPass Service. TinyPass will never store your password for any third-party payment
    processing services.</p>

<p>If you choose to pay for the content on a one-time-transaction (e.g., a la carte) basis, you will be required
    to provide payment information (e.g., PayPal account information) that can be used to complete that
    purchase. [Because the TinyPass Service allows you to replay content you have purchased (subject to the
    terms selected by the Publisher of such content) we will also create a temporary account in our system that
    will allow you to access the content in accordance with its terms. Once the temporary account is no longer
    useful, we will schedule this temporary account and all information associated with the temporary account
    for deletion.] [INTERNAL DISCUSSION POINT: Is this applicable to the TinyPass Service? Why would this be the
    case if TinyPass is only providing a form of payment, not delivering content? Suggest deleting italicized
    text.]</p>

<p>Editing / Deleting Publisher Account Information. Any user who establishes a TinyPass user account can view
    the personally identifiable information we have collected from that user. That information is available at
    the user's account page, where users can add, edit, or delete such personally identifiable information as
    the user sees fit. To completely delete your account and accompanying personal information, please contact
    us at support@TinyPass.com.</p>
<h4>Information We Do Not Collect From Any Users</h4>

<p><b>Children.</b> As explained further in our Consumer Terms of Use and Publisher Terms of Use (available at
    http://tinypass.com/terms), you must be 18 years of age or older – or, if you are under the age of majority
    in your jurisdiction, have the consent of your parent or guardian – to use the TinyPass Service. Therefore,
    we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information about children. In accordance with Federal
    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), TinyPass will never knowingly solicit, nor will we
    accept, personally identifiable information from users known to be under thirteen (13) years of age. If you
    believe that we have information from or about anyone under 13 years of age, please notify us by email at
    support@TinyPass.com or write to our Privacy Officer at the address noted above.</p>

<p><b>Social Security Number.</b> We do not require your social security number to use the TinyPass Service or
    to access any part of our site. TinyPass will never ask for your social security number except in the course
    of required tax documentation prior to publisher payments.</p>
<h4>Information We Track</h4>

<p><b>Log Files.</b> Similar to many websites and internet services, we gather certain anonymous, non-personal
    information automatically and store it in web server log files. This information includes internet protocol
    addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time
    stamp, and click stream data. We use this information to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the
    site, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole. Aggregate information is data we
    collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been
    removed, and therefore does not include your personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><b>Cookies.</b> A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping
    purposes. It can also help us understand how our site visitors click to our site, what pages they view
    during their visit, and their account and preference information as users of the TinyPass Service. Similar
    to many websites, the TinyPass Service stores an encrypted cookie on your computer so we can remember you
    when you come back without requiring you to log in each time. Cookies also allow us to track and understand
    the interests of our users to enhance the overall experience on our site. Cookies used by TinyPass do not
    include your personally identifiable information</p>

<p>If you prefer not to receive cookies, you can set your web browser software to disable them. To do so, please
    refer to the help section of your specific browser for more information on how to manage or disable cookies.
    Please note that your browser must be configured to accept cookies to use the TinyPass Service.</p>
<h4>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</h4>

<p><b>In TinyPass Communications.</b> We use emails and/or prominent notifications on our website as our primary
    means to inform our users of important service and promotional announcements.</p>

<p><b>Service-Related Announcements.</b> When a Publisher establishes an account at http://TinyPass.com, we use
    the email address provided during account creation to deliver important service-related announcements to
    that Publisher. Examples of service-related announcements include: email verification during registration,
    requests for password reset, important security or server maintenance updates, upgrades, and new releases,
    or policy changes. These service-related announcements are considered a fundamental part the TinyPass
    Service, and Publishers cannot opt-out of these email announcements.</p>

<p><b>Promotional Announcements.</b> In order to improve the experience for our users, we will offer you the
    ability to sign up for optional email communications, such as regular updates from TinyPass. These
    communications are enhancements to our service and are entirely optional. We will ask for your consent
    before sending you promotional communications, and will make it easy for you to unsubscribe from these
    communications either through the emails themselves or though your account management options page.</p>

<p><b>Refer A Friend Program.</b> If you choose to use our referral tool to tell a friend about the TinyPass
    Service, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. At your request we will automatically
    send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit this Site. We store this information for the
    purpose of sending this one-time email, and to track the success of our referral program only. TinyPass will
    not use this email address for any other purpose.</p>
<h4>On Our Website</h4>

<p><b>Identification Of Publishers By User Name.</b> When Publishers enable Viewers to pay for Publisher
    Services using the TinyPass Service, such Publisher Services will be identified by the Publisher's User
    Name, Publisher's legal name or Publisher's popularly recognized name. In making Publisher Services
    available for purchase using the TinyPass Service, Publishers are not required to provide or publicize any
    personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><b>Site Statistics.</b> As noted above, we use information collected from our web log files to calculate and
    publish anonymous, non-personal, aggregate statistics that we believe our users are interested in viewing.
    For example, we may track and publish the total number of users who have viewed a Publisher Service. We
    publish this data in aggregate form only, and do not tie it to any personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><b>For Internal Reporting and Analysis</b></p>

<p>As noted above, we use information gathered from log files and cookies to improve our site, analyze trends,
    administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and to gather aggregate information about our
    user base as a whole. We do not tie this data to personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4>HOW WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION</h4>

<p><b>With Third-Parties</b></p>

<p><b>Sharing, Renting, and Selling Information We Collect.</b> We will neither rent nor sell your personally
    identifiable information to anyone without your consent. Occasionally we share anonymous, non-personal,
    aggregate information about our user base with partners or advertisers, and we may publish these aggregate
    usage statistics on our website for the interest of our users. We do not tie this shared or published data
    to the personally identifiable information of any person.</p>

<p><b>Linked Services.</b> In some cases, we allow you to access or link to other web services through our
    website. We also allow you to pay for Publisher Services using the TinyPass Service using selected third
    party payment processing services (e.g., PayPal). We make it easy for you to determine when you are
    accessing or linking to these other web services through our website. In all of these cases, those sites may
    choose to collect your personal information as they deem appropriate. As noted above, we are not responsible
    for or in control of how third parties collect, use, or disclose your information obtained through these
    linked services. We encourage you to be aware when you are using these third party services and, for your
    best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal
    information to them.</p>

<p><b>As Necessary In Certain Legal Circumstances</b></p>

<p><b>Legal Requirements.</b> We reserve the right to disclose your information, including personally
    identifiable information, when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of
    such information is necessary to (a) comply with any law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
    governmental request, (b) enforce this Privacy Policy, including investigation of potential violations of
    this Privacy Policy, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d)
    protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of TinyPass, its users, or the public as required or
    permitted by law.</p>

<p><b>Acquisition.</b> If TinyPass becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all
    of its assets, including bankruptcy, our assets, including user information, may be transferred to a third
    party. At that time, your user information may become subject to that third party's privacy policy. Before
    we transfer your user information, we will notify you either by email or by posting a prominent notice on
    our site, and we will remind you of your ability to add, edit or delete your personally identifiable
    information from your account management options page in advance of any such transfer.</p>
<h4>HOW WE KEEP INFORMATION SECURE</h4>

<p><b>Security of Account Information.</b> Publisher's account information is password-protected. </p>

<p><b>Network Security.</b> We use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard and secure your personal
    information while stored on our computer systems. We have implemented a variety of industry standard
    encryption and security technologies and procedures to protect your information, including your personal
    information, stored in our computer systems from unauthorized access. Please be aware that no method of
    transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, thus we strive to use
    commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, but we cannot guarantee its absolute
    security.</p>

<p><b>Management Procedures.</b> We also maintain industry standard physical and electronic procedural
    safeguards that limit access to your personally identifiable information to our employees (or people working
    on our behalf and under confidentiality agreements) who, through the course of standard business activities,
    need to access your personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><b>Receiving Communications.</b> If you subscribe to any optional promotional communications, you will be
    able to unsubscribe from these communications through your account management options or through the emails
