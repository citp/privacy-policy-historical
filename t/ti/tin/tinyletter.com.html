This policy explains the what, how, and why of the information we collect when you use TinyLetter. It also explains the specific ways we use and disclose that information.

Definitions</h2><p>We’ll start by getting a few definitions out of the way that should help you understand this policy. When we say "we," "us," and "MailChimp,” we’re referring to The Rocket Science Group, LLC d/b/a MailChimp, a State of Georgia limited liability company. When we say “you” or “Member,” we’re referring to the person or entity that’s registered with us to use the Services.</p><p>We provide online platforms that you may use to create, send, and manage emails (the “Services”). We offer the Services on our websites <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">http://www.mailchimp.com</a>, <a href="http://www.tinyletter.com">http://www.tinyletter.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.mandrill.com">http://www.mandrill.com</a> (each a “Website” and together the “Websites”). In the course of providing the Services, we may collect Personal Information, which means information about a Member.  A "Distribution List" is a list of email addresses that one of our Members has sent, or intends to send, emails to, and all information relating to those email addresses.</p><p>MailChimp has TRUSTe's Privacy Seal, which means this privacy policy has been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with their <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">program requirements</a>, including transparency, accountability, and choice related to the collection and use of your personal information.

Changes</h2><p>If there are any changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post them on the Website and send them to the last email address you gave us. Any changes will be effective as of the date we post on the Website or send the email (or whichever date is later). You may object to any changes within 20 days after they’re posted on our Website or delivered to you, in which case none of the proposed changes will be effective with respect to information that we’ve already collected from you; but will apply only to information we collect in the future. We won't treat information of any open account differently from any other open account. If you object to changes in our Privacy Policy, we’ll have to terminate your account. That said, if we ever changed our Privacy Policy to expand our rights to use or disclose Personal Information for marketing purposes, you‘d be able to opt out without termination.</p></div></div></section><section id="section-3"><div class="unit size2of3"><div class="in15"><h2>3.

Information We Collect</h2><ol>
        <li>
        <strong>Information You Provide to Us:</strong> When you register to use the Services, communicate with our customer service team, send us an email, or post on our blog, you’re giving us information that we collect. That information may include your IP address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, credit card information, and other details like gender, occupation, and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, and stored by us, only as described in our <a href="/site/terms.html">Terms of Use</a> and Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>List and Email Information</strong>: When you add an email Distribution List or create an email with the Services, we have access to the data on your list and the information in your email.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Information from your Use of the Service</strong>: We may get information about how and when you use the Services. This information may include your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions taken by you within the application.

We use those cookies to collect information about when you visit our Website, when you use the Services, your browser type and version, your operating system, and other similar information. You may turn off cookies that have been placed on your computer by following the instructions on your browser, but if you block our cookies, it may be more difficult (and maybe even impossible) to use the Services. When you play one of the videos on the Websites, the Flash player may use local shared objects, which are also called Flash cookies. We don’t use these Flash cookies for anything, but we can’t stop the player from dropping them (we tried).
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Web Beacons</strong>: When we send emails to registered MailChimp customers, we'll sometimes track who opened the emails and who clicked the links. We do that to measure our Email Campaigns’ performance and to improve our features for specific segments of customers. To do this, we include single pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create the reports you see about who has or hasn’t opened emails or clicked links. Reports are also available to us when we send you email, so we may collect and review that information.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Information from Other Sources</strong>: We may get more information about you, like name, age and participation in social media websites, by searching the internet or querying third parties (we’ll refer to that information as <span class="tip-anchor" data-target="#tooltip-supplemental-member-information" title="We use this “Supplemental Member Information” to develop features like Social Pro, a tool that helps you learn about your subscribers and send them more relevant content.">Supplemental Member Information</span>).
