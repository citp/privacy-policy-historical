<p></p>


<p>

This Privacy Policy governs your use of this web site and any 
content made available from or through this web site located at <a href="http://www.tirip.com/">www.iransong.com</a>, 
including any subdomains thereof (the “Web Site”). By visiting this Web 
Site or using the services offered on or through this Web Site, you agree to the 
terms of this Privacy Policy, as they may be amended from time to time. As we 
update and expand our Web Site and services, this Privacy Policy may change, so 
check back to this page from time to time. This Privacy Policy is incorporated 
into, and part of, Tirip.Com Terms and Conditions of Use located here (the 
“Terms of Use”), which governs your use of this Web Site in general.<br>
<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or 
that we may obtain, other than through our Web Site, such as by phone, through 
postal mail and through other offline and print media. This Privacy Policy does 
not apply to information collected about you by anyone except us and only 
applies to the Web Site to which this policy is linked.<br>
<br>
<br>
This Web Site is intended for users who are located in the United States of 
America. This Privacy Policy shall be interpreted under the laws of the United 
States.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>A. Purpose</b><br>
<br>
<br>
In order to make your visits to our Web Site and use of the services available 
on or through our Web Site as worthwhile as possible, we may ask you for 
Personal Information and we may collect certain information from your computer 
each time you visit us. “Personal Information” includes, for example, your name; 
home address; business address; e-mail address; telephone, wireless or fax 
number; short message service or text message address or other wireless device 
address; instant messaging address; credit card and other payment information; 
demographic information and other information that may identify you as an 
individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual. From 
time to time, other information, such as your age, gender, education and 
subscription information may also be requested. This Privacy Policy explains, in 
general, what Personal Information and other information is collected on our Web 
Site, how the information is used, and with whom we may share such information. 
California and Canadian residents have the right to know how their information 
may be shared with third parties who engage in direct marketing activities and 
this Privacy Policy explains our practices and how you can opt-out of having 
your information shared for such purposes. Please take a few minutes to read our 
Privacy Policy so that you understand how we treat your information.<br>
<br>
<br>
B. What Information is Collected on this Web Site? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. User-Provided Information<br>
<br>
<br>
We collect two types of personally identifying information from users: personal 
data (such as names and contact details) and aggregated data (such as 
information about traffic patterns on the Web Site, for example, how many users 
log onto the Web Site on a daily basis). We collect personal information from 
users of our Web Site, for example, through such users’ activities, transactions 
and completion of online forms on our Web Site. Such information is collected, 
for example, when users register or subscribe for accounts or features on our 
Web Site, make online purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete 
surveys, contribute to a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or 
other open forum that we may make available on or through our Web Site, submit a 
comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Web 
Site, send us an e-mail, or in any other way submit personal information to us 
via our Web Site.<br>
<br>
<br>
You may be able to send information about our products and services to your 
friends and family members through our Web Site by clicking on an “E-mail to 
Friend” or similar link on our Web Site or in an e-mail that we have sent you. 
In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our e-mail on your own), you 
may provide the name and e-mail address of your friend or family member to us. 
Such information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and 
applicable law.<br>
<br>
<br>
You may also be able to send an online card to a friend or family member, or 
send them a gift or gift certificate. If so, you may be required to provide us 
with your friend’s or family member’s Personal Information. Such information 
will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Web Site Usage Information<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(i) Cookies</b><br>
<br>
We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. 
Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software 
from a Web server when you visit it and are stored on your computer’s hard drive 
for record keeping purposes. Cookies track where you travel on our Web Site and 
what you look at and purchase. They may store the information in your shopping 
cart, and/or your username and password. A cookie may enable us to relate your 
use of our Web Site to other information about you, including your Personal 
Information. These purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on 
our Web Site.<br>
<br>
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the 
internet industry. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not 
subject to our privacy policies. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you 
and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you 
have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to 
reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, 
preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the 
Web Site or certain areas or features of the Web Site. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(ii) Clear GIFs </b> <br>
<br>
We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar 
technologies, in the Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to 
know whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A clear GIF is 
typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as 
well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is 
retrieved from a remote site on the internet enabling the verification of an 
individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A clear GIF may enable 
us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other 
information about you, including your Personal Information. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(iii) IP Address and Clickstream Data</b><br>
<br>
Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and 
information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or Web Site 
registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, our server may 
automatically collect data about your server’s internet address when you visit 
us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a 
number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service 
provider whenever you’re on the internet. When you request pages from our Web 
Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our 
server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another 
web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Web Site; the web site 
you visit after this Web Site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other 
information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software 
and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Web Site 
or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web 
servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help 
diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site. Such 
information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as 
country of origin and internet service provider. We may also link this 
information with your Personal Information when we feel that it is necessary to 
enforce compliance with our rules and policies or Terms of Use or to protect our 
Web Site, customers or others. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site usage information may be 
performed on our behalf by our services providers. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>C. How is the Personal Information Used?</b><br>
<br>
<br>
We use both personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple 
purposes. The Personal Information may be used to improve the content of the Web 
Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Web Site for each individual 
user, and to notify users about updates to the Web Site or promotional offers or 
opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. We will use the 
Personal Information you provide to our Web Site, for example, to respond to 
your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings. For 
example, we will process your orders, respond to your requests and inquiries and 
provide you with the services and features offered on or through our Web Site. 
We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record 
keeping. We may also report information about your account to credit bureaus. 
Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be 
reflected in your credit report. We may match information collected from you 
through different means or at different times, including both Personal 
Information and Web Site usage information, and use such information along with 
information obtained from other sources, including third parties. In addition, 
we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the 
like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies 
and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You 
may opt-out of receiving such notices from us, at any time, by following the 
instructions in the Right to Opt-out section below. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web 
Site and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. We may also 
use information provided to us on an anonymous aggregated basis for purposes of 
analyzing traffic and usage patterns. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
D. Do we Share Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information with Others?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(i) Public Forums</b><br>
<br>
When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Web Site, such as a chat 
discussion, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other open forum that we 
may make available on or through our Web Site, the information that you submit 
will be made available to the general public and will not be considered 
“Personal Information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy. For this reason, we 
recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information, including your full 
name, home address, phone number, other information that would enable other 
users to locate you, or financial information on these areas of our Web Site. 
Instead, make up a username that does not disclose your personal identity. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(ii) Third Party Offers</b><br>
<br>
We may communicate with you on behalf of other entities not affiliated with us
 that have goods, services and offers that we believe might be of interest to 
you. We will not share your individual Personal Information with these entities.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(iii) Co-sponsored Contests, Sweepstakes and Offerings</b><br>
<br>
Some of our contests, sweepstakes and other offerings may be co-sponsored by 
another company. In those situations, the information we obtain from you in 
connection with such contest, sweepstakes or offering may be shared with our 
co-sponsor. In those situations, our co-sponsors will have the right to use your 
information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies. If 
you do not wish for the information we obtain from you to be shared with our 
co-sponsor, then do not enter such contest, sweepstake or other offering or 
otherwise provide to us any Personal Information in connection with such 
contest, sweepstake or other offering. We are not responsible for how our 
co-sponsors may use your information.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(iv) Service Providers</b><br>
<br>
We may use third parties to help operate our Web Site and deliver our products 
and services, and may share your Personal Information with our affiliates, 
service providers and other third parties that provide products or services for 
or through this Web Site or for our business (such as Web Site or database 
hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, 
analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other 
similar service providers that use such information on our behalf). Unless 
otherwise stated, these companies do not have any right to use the Personal 
Information we provide to them beyond what is necessary for them to assist us. 
We may use third parties to provide services in connection with Submitted 
Materials, as that term is defined in the Terms of Use. In accordance with 
section D(i) above, information in forums, information submitted for 
sweepstakes, and Submitted Materials (including submitted video and pictures), 
become publicly available and may be used by us for any lawful purpose. We may 
share personal information that is included with Submitted Materials with third 
parties, including, without limitation, vendors or other service providers, 
affiliates and partners. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When you conduct e-commerce with one of the e-commerce affiliates or service 
providers to which the Web Site may be linked, certain personal information such 
as your e-mail and home address may be collected by the service provider’s 
server and made available to us. We do not, however, transfer credit card 
information you may provide to that service provider.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(v) Aggregate Statistics</b><br>
<br>
We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of 
interest in, and use of, our Web Site and e-mails to third parties in the form 
of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not 
describe or identify any individual user.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(vi) Legally Compelled Disclosures</b><br>
<br>
We may disclose Personal Information to government authorities, and to other 
third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our 
discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not 
limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose 
Personal Information when we have reason to believe that someone has committed, 
or will commit, unlawful acts or acts that endanger the health or safety of 
another; is causing injury to, or interference with, our rights or property, 
other users of the Web Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such 
activities. In some situations, we may share your Personal Information, on a 
confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our 
behalf, such as sending e-mails.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(vii) Business Transfer</b><br>
<br>
In the event that Blue Art, any affiliate of Blue Art, or substantially all of 
its assets, are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an 
acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, 
Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets. For purposes of this 
policy, an “affiliate” of Blue Art is an entity that is under the control of, or 
under common control with, Blue Art (and for these purposes, a company 
controlling twenty 20% percent or more of the voting stock of another entity 
shall be deemed to control such entity). <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>(viii) Third Party Ad Servers</b><br>
<br>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web 
Site. If so, a list of these ad serving companies will be available here. These 
companies may use information (generally, not including your name, address, 
e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this Web Site and to 
other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of 
interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and clear GIFs to measure 
advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via 
cookies and clear GIFs is generally not personally identifiable (unless, for 
example, you provide personally identifiable information to them through an ad 
or e-mail message). We encourage you to read these businesses’ privacy policies 
if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your personal 
information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know 
your choices about not having this information used by these companies, see the 
Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer web site at http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>E. Right to Opt-out </b> <br>
<br>
You have the right to “opt-out” of certain of our uses of your Personal 
Information. For example, at the time you are requested to provide Personal 
Information on this Web Site, you may have the opportunity to elect to, or not 
to receive periodic email products and opportunities from Tirip.Com on behalf 
of selected advertisers. You may also make this request by visiting your profile 
page at www.tirip.com or by sending an e-mail to iransong @t iransong d0t com and 
indicating that you opt not to receive any marketing correspondence from us or 
from affiliated and unaffiliated entities. In this e-mail, please indicate 
whether you would like to: (i) opt-out of receiving any correspondence from us 
or from entities affiliated with us or unaffiliated third parties for their 
marketing purposes; or (ii) opt-out of only selected products. You may also 
opt-out of Blue Art’s promotional e-mails by clicking on an opt-out link within 
the e-mail you receive. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, a request to have us stop sharing your Personal Information with other 
entities for marketing purposes will apply as of the date that is ten (10) 
business days after our receipt of your request, and we will not be responsible 
for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your 
Personal Information prior to such request. In these cases, please contact that 
entity directly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>F. Security </b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>1. General </b> <br>
<br>
No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. 
It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Blue Art to 
intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully, 
including in the case of your contacting us by e-mail or a “contact us” or 
similar feature on our Web Site. Accordingly, though Blue Art will take 
reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal 
Information provided to this Web Site, due to the inherent nature of the 
internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that 
information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our 
system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by 
others, such as hackers. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You may be able to create an account on our Web Site with a username and 
password. If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality 
of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use 
of the Web Site by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or 
not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether 
or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) 
immediately notify Blue Art of any unauthorized use of your password or account 
or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account 
at the end of each session. It is your sole responsibility to control the 
dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your 
account, and notify Blue Art when you desire to cancel your account on this Web 
Site. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from 
your failure to comply with this provision. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or 
unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal 
Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek 
to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would 
endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the 
extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail or by other 
means as required by law. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such 
notification.<br>

<b>2. Phishing</b><br>
<br>
With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for 
unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to 
represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting 
that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the 
domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been 
sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears 
to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such 
sensitive information may be collected by an unauthorized individual to be used 
for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as “phishing.”
<br>
<br>
If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any 
sensitive information (including your Web Site password or credit card 
information) via e-mail or to a web site that does not seem to be affiliated 
with our Web Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not 
provide such information, and report such request to us at iransong @t iransong d0t com.
