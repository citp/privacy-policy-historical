We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only collect information that you voluntarily give us via email, our web hosting signup form or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone. This information includes customer's name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card information required to establish service. 

We will use your information to respond to you regarding the reason you contacted us, or to provide you with information regarding your service. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request.

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.

The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
