**Information Collection and Use**

**Overview**

We may collect from you both anonymous information and personally identifiable information.  Anonymous information is aggregate data that we may use to optimize the efficiency of this website.  Anonymous information does not identify you individually.  Personally identifiable information is information you voluntarily provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your first and last name, physical address, email address or phone number.

**Third Party Services**  

When you visit this website, we reserve the right to use third party services such as _Google Analytics_.  By doing so, we may gather information such as the date and time of your visit, the pages of this website you visit, the address of the website you visit immediately prior to visiting this website, and the type of browser and operating system you use to access this website.  All information obtained from these third party services are anonymous, so no personally identifiable information is received by us in this manner. 

**Cookies**  

This website uses cookies to collect information about how you use this website.  A “cookie” is a small text file sent from this website to your web browser.  You can choose not to receive a cookie by enabling your browser to either refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie.  However, some portions of this website or our services may not function properly if you disable cookies.

**Sharing Personally Identifiable Information**

**Sharing Information**

We may share the anonymous information and the personally identifiable information you disclose to us.  Within our company, we limit access of this information to authorized individuals who have a need to know and who have signed confidentiality agreements with us or are under a legal obligation of confidentiality.  We may also disclose such information to trusted third parties who work with us on this website, or who provide marketing, product development, and other services to us, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.  Lastly, we may release this information to comply with [ICANN’s](https://www.icann.org/) rules, regulations and policies. 

**Releasing Information**

We reserve the right to release your personally identifiable information if required by law.  This includes, but is not limited to, responding to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders and other judicial and administrative requirements.  We may also release your personally identifiable information if we have a good faith belief such action is necessary to protect this website or other rights.

We employ reasonable security procedures and practices to maintain the safety of your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.  When you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number, we encrypt the transmission of that information using Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL).

Transmitting information via the Internet is never completely secure.  Therefore, you should understand that any information submitted may be intercepted by others.  We cannot guarantee the security of any information you send to us through email or this website, and you do so at your own risk.  If you do not feel comfortable providing information through email or this website, please call our office directly using the contact information below.
