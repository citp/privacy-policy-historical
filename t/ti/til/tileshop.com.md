As a practical matter, we must release your mailing address to a postal or courier service if we need to deliver physical product or information you requested. We use third-parties to assist us with our payment processing and marketing efforts, including assisting us with sending emails to you and responding to your reviews and questions. This may include sending you free electronic newsletters and promotional emails for products and/or services offered on our Web Site as a service.

If you prefer to opt out of receiving advertising and promotions, please see the instructions at YOUR PRIVACY PREFERENCES below. We may also enter relationships with third-parties for services such as credit card processing and shipping, whose privacy practices meet our privacy standards. 

We use third-party service providers to offer financial services, such as, The Tile Shop credit card and to provide extended warranty services. We may share information about our consumers with these service providers in order to provide you with tailored information about products, services and special offers. These third-party service providers also have their own privacy statements that set out the manner in which they will collect, use and disclose personal information. We encourage you to review each service provider's privacy statement at the time you submit your application for financial products or an extended warranty.

We may disclose PII to protect our rights or the rights of others, including to respond to a subpoena, court order or other such request. We may also provide such PII in response to a law enforcement agency's request or as otherwise required by law.

From time to time, we may establish business relationships with other reputable companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you and whose privacy practices meet our privacy standards. Through these relationships we might rent, exchange, share and/or cross-reference information, including contact information about you that will enable these companies to contact you regarding products or services in which you may be interested.
