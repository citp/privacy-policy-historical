The information sent to us may include data on the pages you access, your location, mobile network information, device type, standard web log data, Internet protocol address, and other information. Web log data includes the browser type you're using and traffic to and from our site. When you access Tilt.com or the Services, we also track and collect information about your use of and transactions and activities on them. 

Every computer connected to the Internet is assigned a unique number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. Since these numbers are usually assigned in country-based blocks, an IP address can often be used to identify the country from which a computer is connecting to the Internet.

Additionally, when you create an account, we also may collect additional information about you. Such information may include:

  * Contact information, such as your name, email address, phone number, and other similar information.
  * Financial information, such as bank account numbers or charge card numbers that you store in your account. 
  * Detailed personal information used to verify your identity, such as your date of birth or social security number. 



When you enter financially sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our Website or Services, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We may obtain information about you from other sources, including credit bureaus, identity verification services, third-party websites, or our payment processors, and combine that with information we collect on our Website or our Services.

You can log into our Services using Facebook Connect or a similar registration or login process that may be enabled from time to time. This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us. We may also ask you for additional information when using Facebook Connect, and you will be notified of those requests. The information we may receive varies by site and is controlled by that site. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Tilt account and authorizing Tilt to have access to this information, you agree that Tilt may collect, store, and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

To protect you from fraud and misuse of your personal information, we may collect information about your use and interaction with our Website or Services. As an example, we may evaluate your computer, mobile phone, or other access device to identify any malicious software or activity.

## We Think This Is Personal Information

In this Privacy Policy, we use the term "Personal Information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. Non-personally identifiable information is information about users that no longer reflects or references an individually identifiable user.

## PCI Security At Its Finest

We transmit and store cardholder data under the most stringent credit card security standard: PCI Compliance Level 1. A PCI-certified auditor verified and awarded us this level of security and compliance.

## Keeping It On The Hush

We want to keep your personal information on the hush. We and our cloud provider protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. Some of the safeguards leveraged are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to the data centers, and information access authorization controls. 

To process your contributions to a Campaign, we may share some of your personal information with the Campaign Admin, including a Political Campaign Admin, or with other people who contributed to the Campaign, such as your name or the amount you contributed. We also may share your personal information with our payments processor, so that we can receive and disburse money related to Campaigns. Such information may include your name, and when you contributed, as well as the contribution amount, the card number, or other bank-related information. 

Additionally, we may share your personal information with:

  * Banking partners as required by credit card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants (in the event that you meet their criteria,) which includes having Tilt close your Tilt account due to your breaching the Tilt Terms of Use. 
  * Affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process personal information for us, or help with our business operations, such as for marketing, fraud prevention, compliance, and technology services, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  * Credit bureaus and collection agencies to report account information, as permitted by law. 
  * Companies, organizations or individuals outside of Tilt if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Tilt, our users or the public as required or permitted by law, i.e. to comply with a subpoena.
  * Companies we plan to merge with or to be acquired by. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.
  * Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so. 



Tilt will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.

If you open a Tilt account directly on a third-party website or via a third-party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a Tilt website) may be shared with the owner of the third-party website or application. These sites are governed by their own privacy policies and you are encouraged to review their privacy policies before providing them with personal information. Tilt is not responsible for the conduct or information practices of such third parties. If you purchase goods or services through a third party on that third-party platform or on the Services using your Tilt account information, we may share your personal information related to your purchase with that third party. Such personal information may include your name, email address, and transaction information (item, amount, time, etc.) However, we will not disclose your charge card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you using the Services, except with your express permission.

We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners, including publishers, advertisers, or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of the Services. 

## Talk To Me Maybe

We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our Services, content, or advertising. If you do not wish to receive newsletters, campaign updates, or marketing communications from us or participate in our ad-customized programs, simply indicate so in your notifications panel (if the functionality is enabled) or email us at Privacy@Tilt.com. 

We may call you when you provide us your phone number, such as for customer support or to reach out to you regarding the Services. If you do not wish for us to contact you by phone, please let us know at Privacy@Tilt.com.

## Spreading The Word

We give you the option to share things on Tilt and through other services you use, such as through Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and others. Please be aware of your sharing settings on those other services. They may collect your IP address, track pages you visit on our site, and set a cookie so that they function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

Tilt maintains your preferences for the use and sharing of information, including how or when we contact you. Some federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances. Tilt does not share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes unless you have given us your explicit consent. 

When you contribute to a nonprofit related campaign, we give you the option to share your information with that nonprofit (for instance, your name, email address, and contribution-related information.) We do not share your information with nonprofits as a result of these campaigns by default. However, when you make a single donation over $250 to a verified nonprofit, we share your information with that nonprofit for the purpose of their sending you a tax-deductible receipt.

For Sensitive Personal Information, we only share this information with third parties with your express consent.

## Shine the Light on Me

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits those users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. You can make such a request only once a year, and you don't have to pay for it.
