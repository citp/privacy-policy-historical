	<span class="bookBy">Internet Privacy Policy </span><br>
<p>
Technology and new marketing practices have increased the amount of customer
information collected and shared in today's marketplace. The Marcus
Buckingham Company maintains a firm commitment to protect the privacy of the
information you share with us; the following document will disclose the
privacy principles and practices we follow.
</p>

<span class="bookBy">Information Collected </span>
<p>
The Marcus Buckingham Company, as a part of offering services on this web
site, which you have chosen to visit, collects certain information.
Information is collected in two ways, automatically via the operation of the
site's servers, software, and the web browser you use to connect to these
services, and voluntarily via input from you to forms and other features of
the site. The information we collect is limited to such information as is
necessary to provide you with the highest level of customer service, and
with access to those services you have chosen to utilize on our website.</p>
<p>Automatically collected information includes your "IP Address" which is used
to help diagnose server problems and to administer our site, and certificate
information from your browser, which is used by secure areas of our site to
initiate confidential messaging services. Voluntary information collected
may include information you provide to us when you use any of our online
tools, when you send us email, when you purchase from our online store, or
when you use future products and tools such as may be offered from time to
time. In all cases of online information collection, you are anonymous to us
unless you provide your email address or other identifying information with
your personal information.</p>

<span class="bookBy">Use of Collected Information </span>
<p>
Our sites uses "cookies" and other automatically collected information to
track your shopping cart, should you decide to shop at our eStore, and to
save passwords and state information for use on the site. Voluntarily
provided information is used to provide you with the products and services
you request.</p>
<p>We also may use contact information we collect to communicate with you, to
respond to your questions and requests, and to send you information about
our company or promotional materials concerning our partners. We may share
certain information that you provide with selected partners, so that you may
receive information from them that we feel will be of interest to you.
Should you not desire to receive this information, you may contact as via email
at <a href="mailto: CustomerService@tmbc.com">Customer Service</a>, call us at 
323-302-9810, or notify us in writing to The Marcus Buckingham Company, 
8350 Wilshire Blvd Suite 200, Beverly Hills, CA 90211. For further information regarding
opt-out, please see the section on "Communication Choices" below.<br>
<br>
Financial information, such as credit card numbers and billing codes, may be
used to bill you for services or products received.</p>
<p>Identification information, such as account numbers, user ids, and
passwords, may be used to positively identify you to our computer systems
and to customize your experience of the site to your individual preferences.</p>
<p>The Marcus Buckingham Company does not share the personal information collected online.  
The California "Shine the Light" Act, (SB 27), codified at Cal. Civ. Code 1798.83 therefore 
does not apply to the information gathered.</p>

<span class="bookBy">Access to Information</span>
<p>
Only those employees who need and require customer information to perform
their duties are authorized to access customer information. Information
shared with business partners is limited to only that information necessary
to allow them to provide you with information regarding services and
products in which you may have an interest. Additionally, we require that
companies we select as business partners honor our privacy requirements in
the handling of customer information we provide to them.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we may be compelled by law to provide information to
requesting legal entities or agencies. If we receive a subpoena or similar
legal process demanding release of any information about you, we will
generally attempt to notify you before we comply with the request (when
practicable or unless we believe we are prohibited from doing so). Except as
required by law or as described above, we do not share information with
requesting outside parties, including government agencies.</p>


<span class="bookBy">Protecting the Confidentiality of Your Information </span>
<p>
We take our responsibility to protect the privacy and confidentiality of
customer information very seriously. We maintain physical, electronic, and
procedural safeguards that comply with best practice standards to store and
secure information about you from unauthorized access, alteration, and
destruction.</p>
<p>We have procedures in place and observe strict security practices that limit
employee access to your personal information to those employees with a
specific business reason to know this information.</p>
<p>We place a high degree of importance on customer confidentiality. All of our
employees are aware of their responsibility to keep customer information
confidential. We audit employee access to records and will take appropriate
disciplinary measures to enforce the privacy responsibilities of employees.</p>


<span class="bookBy">How We Safeguard Your Information </span>
<p>
SSL Technology and how you benefit from it
The Marcus Buckingham Company has taken a number of steps to enhance the
protection of personal or confidential information sent to or from the
company over the Internet. This includes credit card and other personal
information. Sites within The Marcus Buckingham web site arena that solicit
or otherwise collect personal or confidential information require the
establishment of a secure session using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
Technology.</p>
<p>SSL technology creates a private conversation between your computer and the
Marcus Buckingham site being accessed. SSL technology encodes information as
it is being sent over the Internet thereby ensuring that the transmitted
information remains confidential.</p>
<p>The use of SSL requires two components: an SSL-compatible browser and a Web
server to perform the "key-exchange" that establishes the secure connection.</p>
<p>You will need a browser with SSL capabilities. Examples of SSL browsers
include Netscape 2.0 and above, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 2.0 and above,
and the Web browser for America Online version 3.0 for Windows and above.
(Note that some older versions of browsers will not support SSL sessions).
If you don't already have a browser with SSL capabilities, you can download
an SSL browser from any of the links below.
</p><p>
<a href="http://browser.netscape.com" target="_blank"><strong>Netscape Navigator</strong></a><br>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads" target="_blank"><strong>Internet Explorer</strong></a><br>
<a href="http://www.aol.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AOL</strong></a><br></p>
<p>In order to securely access your personal or confidential information via
the Internet, we recommend you use the latest browser versions available.
Accessing secure online areas with Netscape versions before 1.12 (Mac or
Unix) or 1.22 (Windows) is prohibited due to security concerns.</p>
<p>
A Compliant Internet Service Provider

<br>
<br>

Most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) automatically enable SSL sessions. If
you use your company's internal connection to access the Internet and you
find you cannot access our secure pages with an SSL browser, your company
may be blocking access via a "firewall." Please contact your network
administrator.
<br>
<br>
Enabled Cookies
<br>
<br>
Your browser must have enabled cookies in order to access confidential
information. If you have chosen to disable cookies on your browser, you will
not be able to access confidential information.

<br>
<br>

<span class="bookBy">User ID and Password </span><br>
</p><p>
Some areas of the site may require the use of a User ID and Password as an
additional security measure that helps protect your confidential
information. This allows us to verify who you are, thereby allowing you
access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access.
<br>
<br>


When you have finished using a secure area of our site, ensure that you
always click on the "Log Off" link. When you click on it, you will be given
the option to end your secure session. No further secure transactions can be
conducted without re-entering your User ID and Password.
<br>
<br>


You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look
at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary
memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows
you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects
the security of your confidential User ID or Password. If you use a computer
in a public place to access your account information, simply quit/exit the
browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of anyone else
viewing your confidential information.
<br>

<br>




<span class="bookBy">Linking to Other Internet Sites </span><br>
</p><p>
You should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to from our site
may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our
Privacy Statement. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that
you review the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit.
</p>
 
<span class="bookBy">Communication Choices </span><br>
<p>
You may elect to stop receiving information from us, and/or from our
partners, at any time, by notifying us via telephone at
323-302-9810 or in writing to The Marcus Buckingham Company, 8350 Wilshire Blvd Suite 200, 
Beverly Hills, CA 90211. Once you have opted out of further
communications, you will not receive emails, catalogs, or telephone
solicitations from us, and we will not share your information with our
partners. You may continue to receive information from business partners, as
we have no control over their sources or use of contact information.


</p>

<span class="bookBy">Review and Change of Information </span><br>
<p>
We are committed to maintaining complete and accurate information about our
customers. You may review information that we retain on you and your
relationship with us, and we will promptly correct any and all errors in
that information. If you find any information that we maintain about you or
your accounts to be incorrect, please notify us immediately, either by
telephone at 323-302-9810, or in writing at The Marcus Buckingham Company, 
8350 Wilshire Blvd Suite 200, Beverly Hills, CA 90211. Please do not contact 
us via normal email; we cannot guarantee the security of any information you 
send us via normal email.
</p>

<span class="bookBy">Children </span><br>
<p>
Products of The Marcus Buckingham Company are not routinely marketed to
children, and no age verification outside of the provision of a credit card
occurs on this site. Provision of a valid credit card is taken as evidence
that an individual is authorized to purchase products and services from the
site.
