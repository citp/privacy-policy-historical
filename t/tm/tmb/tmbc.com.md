# Privacy Policy

Technology and new marketing practices have increased the amount of customer information collected and shared in today's marketplace. The Marcus Buckingham Company maintains a firm commitment to protect the privacy of the information you share with us; the following document will disclose the privacy principles and practices we follow. 

The Marcus Buckingham Company, as a part of offering services on this web site, which you have chosen to visit, collects certain information. Information is collected in two ways, automatically via the operation of the site's servers, software, and the web browser you use to connect to these services, and voluntarily via input from you to forms and other features of the site. The information we collect is limited to such information as is necessary to provide you with the highest level of customer service, and with access to those services you have chosen to utilize on our website.

Automatically collected information includes your "IP Address" which is used to help diagnose server problems and to administer our site, and certificate information from your browser, which is used by secure areas of our site to initiate confidential messaging services. Voluntary information collected may include information you provide to us when you use any of our online tools, when you send us email, when you purchase from our online store, or when you use future products and tools such as may be offered from time to time. In all cases of online information collection, you are anonymous to us unless you provide your email address or other identifying information with your personal information.

Our sites uses "cookies" and other automatically collected information to track your shopping cart, should you decide to shop at our eStore, and to save passwords and state information for use on the site. Voluntarily provided information is used to provide you with the products and services you request.

We also may use contact information we collect to communicate with you, to respond to your questions and requests, and to send you information about our company or promotional materials concerning our partners. We may share certain information that you provide with selected partners, so that you may receive information from them that we feel will be of interest to you. Should you not desire to receive this information, you may contact as via email at [Customer Service](mailto:customerservice@tmbc.com), call us at 323-302-9810, or notify us in writing to The Marcus Buckingham Company, 8350 Wilshire Blvd Suite 200, Beverly Hills, CA 90211. For further information regarding opt-out, please see the section on "Communication Choices" below.

Financial information, such as credit card numbers and billing codes, may be used to bill you for services or products received.

Identification information, such as account numbers, user ids, and passwords, may be used to positively identify you to our computer systems and to customize your experience of the site to your individual preferences.

The Marcus Buckingham Company does not share the personal information collected online. The California "Shine the Light" Act, (SB 27), codified at Cal. Civ. Code 1798.83 therefore does not apply to the information gathered.

Only those employees who need and require customer information to perform their duties are authorized to access customer information. Information shared with business partners is limited to only that information necessary to allow them to provide you with information regarding services and products in which you may have an interest. Additionally, we require that companies we select as business partners honor our privacy requirements in the handling of customer information we provide to them.

Occasionally, we may be compelled by law to provide information to requesting legal entities or agencies. If we receive a subpoena or similar legal process demanding release of any information about you, we will generally attempt to notify you before we comply with the request (when practicable or unless we believe we are prohibited from doing so). Except as required by law or as described above, we do not share information with requesting outside parties, including government agencies.

We take our responsibility to protect the privacy and confidentiality of customer information very seriously. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with best practice standards to store and secure information about you from unauthorized access, alteration, and destruction.

We have procedures in place and observe strict security practices that limit employee access to your personal information to those employees with a specific business reason to know this information.

We place a high degree of importance on customer confidentiality. All of our employees are aware of their responsibility to keep customer information confidential. We audit employee access to records and will take appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce the privacy responsibilities of employees.

SSL Technology and how you benefit from it The Marcus Buckingham Company has taken a number of steps to enhance the protection of personal or confidential information sent to or from the company over the Internet. This includes credit card and other personal information. Sites within The Marcus Buckingham web site arena that solicit or otherwise collect personal or confidential information require the establishment of a secure session using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology.

SSL technology creates a private conversation between your computer and the Marcus Buckingham site being accessed. SSL technology encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet thereby ensuring that the transmitted information remains confidential.

The use of SSL requires two components: an SSL-compatible browser and a Web server to perform the "key-exchange" that establishes the secure connection.

You will need a browser with SSL capabilities. Examples of SSL browsers include Netscape 2.0 and above, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 2.0 and above, and the Web browser for America Online version 3.0 for Windows and above. (Note that some older versions of browsers will not support SSL sessions). If you don't already have a browser with SSL capabilities, you can download an SSL browser from any of the links below. 

In order to securely access your personal or confidential information via the Internet, we recommend you use the latest browser versions available. Accessing secure online areas with Netscape versions before 1.12 (Mac or Unix) or 1.22 (Windows) is prohibited due to security concerns.

A Compliant Internet Service Provider 

Most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) automatically enable SSL sessions. If you use your company's internal connection to access the Internet and you find you cannot access our secure pages with an SSL browser, your company may be blocking access via a "firewall." Please contact your network administrator. 

Enabled Cookies 

Your browser must have enabled cookies in order to access confidential information. If you have chosen to disable cookies on your browser, you will not be able to access confidential information. 

Some areas of the site may require the use of a User ID and Password as an additional security measure that helps protect your confidential information. This allows us to verify who you are, thereby allowing you access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access. 

When you have finished using a secure area of our site, ensure that you always click on the "Log Off" link. When you click on it, you will be given the option to end your secure session. No further secure transactions can be conducted without re-entering your User ID and Password. 

You should be aware that browser software often "caches" a page as you look at it, meaning that some pages are saved in your computer's temporary memory. Therefore, you may find that clicking on your "Back" button shows you a saved version of a previously viewed page. Caching in no way affects the security of your confidential User ID or Password. If you use a computer in a public place to access your account information, simply quit/exit the browser software before leaving to minimize the possibility of anyone else viewing your confidential information. 

You should be aware that other Internet sites that you link to from our site may contain privacy provisions that differ from the provisions of our Privacy Statement. To ensure your privacy is protected, we recommend that you review the privacy statements of other Internet sites you visit. 

You may elect to stop receiving information from us, and/or from our partners, at any time, by notifying us via telephone at 323-302-9810 or in writing to The Marcus Buckingham Company, 8350 Wilshire Blvd Suite 200, Beverly Hills, CA 90211. Once you have opted out of further communications, you will not receive emails, catalogs, or telephone solicitations from us, and we will not share your information with our partners. You may continue to receive information from business partners, as we have no control over their sources or use of contact information. 

We are committed to maintaining complete and accurate information about our customers. You may review information that we retain on you and your relationship with us, and we will promptly correct any and all errors in that information. If you find any information that we maintain about you or your accounts to be incorrect, please notify us immediately, either by telephone at 323-302-9810, or in writing at The Marcus Buckingham Company, 8350 Wilshire Blvd Suite 200, Beverly Hills, CA 90211. Please do not contact us via normal email; we cannot guarantee the security of any information you send us via normal email. 

Products of The Marcus Buckingham Company are not routinely marketed to children, and no age verification outside of the provision of a credit card occurs on this site. Provision of a valid credit card is taken as evidence that an individual is authorized to purchase products and services from the site.
