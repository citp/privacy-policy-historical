### Privacy Policy

#### Ordering Products through our Website

When you decide to order a product featured on our website such as a cell phone with service plan activation, you will be redirected to the merchant website through which that product is fulfilled. In some cases the merchant's website will be "co-branded" with our logo. This co-branded website is operated completely by the merchant, independently from tmiWireless.com, and collects personally identifiable information directly from you when you submit your order. tmiWireless.com does not capture order information including any personally identifiable information from you. Some merchants may provide sales reporting to tmiWireless.com that includes limited personal information such as your name, the date of your order, the product you ordered, and the status of the order. Please note that each merchant featured on this site has their own privacy policy and we recommend you read the merchant's privacy policy before submitting your order. tmiWireless.com is not responsible for the effectiveness of any merchant's privacy policy. For your convenience, we have included links to the privacy policy documents hosted by each merchant featured on our website.
