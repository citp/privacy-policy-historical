						<p class="no_padding1">Certain states, such as California, have passed legislation 
							requiring certain specific disclosures be made available to their residents who 
							use the Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing 
							purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer’s 
							personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct 
							marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, 
							addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received 
							that personal information. If you are a California resident you may request 
							this information from Tiburon Media by writing to Tiburon Media ,21 Main Street, 
							Tiburon, CA 94920., Attn: Privacy Rights or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@tiburonmedia.com">
								privacy@tiburonmedia.com</a>. Tiburon Media  is not obligated to respond to 
							more than one such request from you per calendar year.
