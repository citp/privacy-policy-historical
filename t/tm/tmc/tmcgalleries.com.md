Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence. 

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how 18magazine.com collects information from all end users of 18magazine.com's Internet services (the "Services") those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members") what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. 18magazine.com requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. 

**Personal Information 18magazine.com Collects and How It Is Used**

**Introduction.** 18magazine.com collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below. 

[^ BACK TO TOP](http://www.panchodog.com/privacy.php?tsite=18magazine.com#top)

**Registration**. Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. However, in instances where 18magazine.com and a partner jointly promote the Services, 18magazine.com may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. 18magazine.com may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.

To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information.

We share aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.

Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the advertisement to the intended audience. 18magazine.com does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers.

This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.

However, 18magazine.com may disclose personal information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect 18magazine.com and our Members.
