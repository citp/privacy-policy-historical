We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how 18magazine.com collects information from all end users of 18magazine.com's Internet services (the "Services") those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members") what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. 18magazine.com requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.

          <p><strong><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction. </strong>18magazine.com collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below. <br>

Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes).

However, in instances where 18magazine.com and a partner jointly promote the Services, 18magazine.com may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this instance, personal information may not be used by the 			partner for any other purpose. 18magazine.com may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services. <br>
