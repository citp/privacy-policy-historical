<p>Truckee Meadows Community College policy respects the privacy of all Web site visitors to the extent permitted by law. This online privacy statement is intended to inform you of the ways in which this Web site collects information, the uses to which that information will be put, and the ways in which we will protect any information you choose to provide us.</p>
<h4>TMCC Privacy Notice</h4>
<p>In accordance with institutional policy and the U.S. Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), Truckee Meadows Community College vigorously protects the privacy of student education records. The institution does not release private records of individual students, such as grades and class schedules, without prior written consent of the student.</p>
<p>As permitted under federal law, the sole exception to the above practice is the release of "directory" information considered to be public in nature and not generally deemed to be an invasion of privacy. At Truckee Meadows Community College, the following categories are defined as "directory" information: student name, address, telephone number, semesters of enrollment, full-time/part-time status, degree(s) awarded, emphasis field(s) and date(s) of graduation.</p>
<p>Students have the right to request non-disclosure of directory information. If they do not restrict release of this information, it is probable that the information will be released or disclosed. Truckee Meadows Community College uses directory information for non-commercial, educational purposes, such as to mail notices to students about changes in policies, services, or opportunities. Directory information may also be provided for commercial purposes to businesses affiliated with the institution, honor societies, the alumni association and foundation, or other individuals for purposes that may be beneficial to students. The institution exercises discretion in responding to requests for directory information and may or may not provide such information when requested, depending on the intended purpose of the request. The institution does not sell or rent student information for a fee.</p>
<p>It is important to consider carefully the potential consequences of restricting the release of directory information. If a student restricts release for non-commercial educational purposes, the institution will be unable to place the student's name in publications such as honors and graduation programs; to confirm graduation and dates of attendance to potential employers; to verify enrollment with organizations such as insurance companies; or to send notifications about specialized scholarships without the express written authorization of the student.</p>
<p>If, after due consideration, you wish to restrict the release of directory information, please <a href="/admissions/downloads/forms/enrollment/ADMITMCCPrivacyPrintMat.pdf">download the form</a> <a href="/pdf/" title="This is a PDF document and requires Adobe Reader to view. Click on this icon to download the free Adobe Reader!" class="nb"><img src="/images/pdf_tiny.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="PDF icon" title="This is a PDF document and requires Adobe Reader to view. Click on this icon to download the free Adobe Reader!" class="pdf"></a>. The authorization can be mailed, faxed, or delivered in person to the office indicated on the form. A copy of the authorization form is also available in the class schedule/registration guide. This directive will apply permanently to your record until you choose to reverse it by submitting a written authorization to the Admissions and Records Office.</p>
<h4>Network Traffic Logs</h4>
<p>In the course of ensuring network security and consistent service for all users, TMCC employs software programs to do such things as monitor network traffic, identify unauthorized access or access to nonpublic information, detect computer viruses and other software that might damage TMCC's computers or the network, and monitor and tune the performance of the TMCC network. In the course of such monitoring, these programs may detect such information as e-mail headers, addresses from network packets, and other information. Information from these activities is used only for the purpose of maintaining the security and performance of the TMCC's networks and computer systems. Personally identifiable information from these activities is not released to external parties without your consent unless authorized by the TMCC President or required by law.</p>
