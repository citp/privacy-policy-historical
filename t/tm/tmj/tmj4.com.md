Our Site collects information in different ways, including but not limited to when you participate in sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and surveys; subscribe to our online services or features, such as news, weather and traffic alerts; register for our newsletters, other publications and loyalty clubs; download podcasts; purchase products or services through our shopping service; communicate with us via email; or apply for employment with us. __

**_Loyalty Awards or Membership Program_**

Our stations' loyal listeners and viewers may join our loyalty award or membership programs to receive information about various station activities, on-air personalities, programming, contests and sweepstakes, local events, and promotional offers or ads from advertisers and sponsors via email and/or mobile devices. You will be required to submit your name, age or date of birth, gender, postal address and/or email address.

**_Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions_**

We conduct various contests, sweepstakes and promotions over the air, online and at remote locations. Certain contests, sweepstakes or promotions are only for members of our Loyalty Awards or Membership programs. Depending on the type of contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you will be required to submit your name, age or date of birth, gender, postal address and/or email address. Additional non-Personal Information may be requested depending on the nature of the activity and such information may be associated with your Personal Information. If the activity is conducted online, we do not knowingly collect the Personal Information from a person under the age of 13 and we will delete such information, to the extent technically possible, in the event we discover or have knowledge that a child has registered for an online contest, sweepstakes or other promotional activity. Persons that falsify their contest/sweepstakes entry for any reason will immediately forfeit any prize, benefit or compensation. 

For all contests and sweepstakes, you may need to show state-issued identification to verify your identity and eligibility if you are selected to be a winner. If you win a prize valued at $600 or more, or have won in one calendar year prizes that are valued at $600 or more in the aggregate, you must also provide your social security number and complete the required IRS Form W-9 for federal tax reporting. 

**_Specialized Features_**

We offer several specialized features such as automotive and sports related websites, often in conjunction with JCI Affiliates or non-affiliated third parties. To join or subscribe to these specialized features or websites, you may be requested to submit your name, postal address and billing address (if different than delivery address), email address, age or year of birth, and/or gender. If a specialized feature or website is provided by both JBG and a JCI Affiliate or a third party, both entities will own and use your Personal Information consistent with their individual privacy policies.

We may also provide our users and/or members with the opportunity to weigh-in on local or national issues or share personal interests by participating in a survey or a questionnaire. We may collect your email address and other information related to the subject matter, such a politics, travel, sports, food, education, or medical information. Some surveys or questionnaires may also be anonymous, meaning you do not have to submit your name or email address. 

**_User Generated Content (UGC)_**

Users of our Sites may submit news tips, story suggestions, audio, video, photographs, animation and other content for various features on these Sites or for offline purposes such as a resource for our broadcast stations and entertainment features. Depending on the nature of the UGC, you may be required to complete a registration process, which may require the submission of your name, email address, telephone number, city, state and zip code. Our news editors or reporters, at their discretion, may contact a user for additional information related to the user and/or the user's content.

Upon entry of your credit card number into our secured system, whether the number is collected offline or online, the credit card account number is encrypted and retained until your account is cancelled and deleted.

You must subscribe to a mobile service or request that we send such information to you via a text message or a wireless voice call. Depending on the type of mobile subscription service, you will be asked to submit your name, age or date of birth, mobile telephone number, and/or standard email address. We do not request submission of a wireless email address and if we collect such information inadvertently for a marketing or advertising opportunity, we will attempt to notify you and request a standard mobile telephone number that does not have a wireless domain name attached to it. You have a right to opt-out of any mobile service in the same manner in which you registered or by notifying our Privacy Administrator.

**_Marketing Via Fax_**

We may send commercial advertising and promotional material via facsimile to our businesses that the JBG or any of its radio or television stations have an existing business relationship with. We require affirmative consent from the recipients of a commercial fax or we will respond to an inquiry or invitation to send a commercial fax. We may also fax material that is primarily informational or transactional, however, such material is not deemed to be commercial and does not require either an existing business relationship or affirmative consent. You have a right to opt-out of any commercial fax by following the opt-out instructions on these Sites or on the first page of the fax.

**_Contact Us_**

If you use our Sites' email address hyperlink or telephone number to contact us, we may ask for your name, email address and/or telephone number. **_We will not ask for, nor should you send any sensitive or confidential Personal Information via email, such as social security number, credit card account number, or a driver's license number._** If you receive an email requesting any such information from us or someone that claims they are with the JBG, please contact our Privacy Administrator immediately.

If you send correspondence to us that pertains to our broadcast operations or programming, we are required by federal law to place all such correspondence in the station's FCC Public Inspection File, which may also be posted electronically on these Sites. Please see our section titled "Do we collect Personal Information from or about children?" for details on how we handle such correspondence from children.

Our Sites may also enable you to submit Personal Information about other people. We may collect Personal Information about other people from you when you participate in various programs and features or when you submit news stories or nominations for community awards or recognition that involve other people. We generally use this Personal Information to process your request, submission or to investigate and report news stories. 

We may also combine your Personal Information with information obtained from JCI Affiliates, our operational service providers or other companies.

**Do we collect Personal Information from or about children?**

We recognize the particular importance of protecting the privacy of children. We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not generally target children for our goods and services and do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us that does not qualify for any regulatory, legal, or security/safety exemption as described below, or we are contacted by a verifiable parent or legal guardian about his or her child's participation on our Sites, we will delete the Personal Information about the child from our active records and from our systems to the extent technically feasible. 

We are required by federal law to place all correspondence from the public related to a station's operations or programming in the station's FCC Public Inspection File, which may also be posted electronically on these Sites. If we know that email or other correspondence is from a child, we cannot delete the correspondence but we reserve the discretion to remove any Personal Information that could be used to contact the child from the correspondence before placing it in the FCC Public inspection File. 

On occasion, our Sites may enable parents or legal guardians to submit information about their child under the age of 13 for purposes of participating in programs or features, such as a weather kids program and contests. In such instances, we only request the types of Personal Information necessary for participation in the program, which may include, but is not limited to, the parent's name and email address, child's name, age, city, and a photograph of the child. This information would be used only for purposes of the specific program or feature. 

**How do we passively collect and use information through tracking technology?**

Our Sites passively collect certain kinds of information that reveal the frequency with which you visit our Sites, the times and dates of your visits, the pages you reviewed, and other information, including an Internet protocol (IP) address, which is series of numbers that identifies the computer you are using. Information is passively collected through various means. We use IP addresses to identify server problems, administer our Sites, and compile aggregated statistics for marketing and research purposes, and to serve customized advertising or content to you based on your IP address' geographic location. We also use navigational data, including log files and click-stream data, to identify information about your web browser and operating system, and the time period in which you visit our Sites or select pages or areas of our Sites. This information is also used to improve our Sites' content and is retained anonymously, meaning that it does not identify an individual user. 

Our Sites use small text files called "cookies" that are sent to the hard drive of your computer to store bits of information related to your use of our Sites. Cookies can store a variety of information, including IP addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, shopping cart information and passwords needed to access our Sites. We may use cookies to serve customized advertising or content to you based on your submitted zip code, age, gender, or other demographics. You may configure your browser to reject cookies. If you do so, you might not be able to access important functions or enjoy certain conveniences or customized features of our Sites.

Our Sites may also use "Web beacons" to help personalize your experience, similarly to how we use cookies. We may also use Web beacons to gather non-Personal Information about the number of users who visit our Sites, the areas in which they spend their time visiting, and other demographic data. 

We do not ordinarily combine passively collected Personal Information (as described above) with actively collected Personal Information. **** However, for Sites' interactive features such as blogs, chat rooms and bulletin boards, we have the capability to correlate your comment with your IP address and account in the event you are in violation of the Sites' Terms of Use agreement or may be subject to a civil or criminal inquiry or investigation. We also reserve the right to introduce new passive tracking technologies and techniques. 

Operational service providers, such as Yahoo!, use cookies and web beacons to help us display customized content and advertising based on your demographics (such as gender, age or city/state), Site visits, searches and purchases. Yahoo! automatically collects information about your browser and computer, including your IP address, Yahoo!'s cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the webpage that you request. Yahoo! does not disclose your Personal Information to an Advertiser or a third party marketer when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, you may chose to accept the Advertiser's own cookie if you click or interact with an ad. Yahoo! may also combine Personal Information or non-personal information about you that it obtains from us, other business partners, and other companies. 

**If you wish to opt-out of receiving customized content and ads from Yahoo! based on your personal preferences or usage habits, please[click here](http://subscribe.yahoo.com/showaccount).**

**Do we share your Personal Information with third parties?**

Except as stated in this Privacy Policy or unless your consent is obtained at the time of collection or prior to transfer, your Personal Information will not be shared with any third party outside of JCI Affiliates and operational service providers. We will share your Personal Information with JCI and JCI Affiliates primarily for business and operational purposes and occasionally for promotional and marketing purposes.

We may sometimes offer promotions or contests that are sponsored by, co-sponsored or co-branded with either JCI Affiliates or non-affiliated third parties such as Advertisers, in which we will provide you notice that your Personal Information will be shared with these identified third parties for purposes of fulfilling contest prizes and delivering email and other direct marketing communications to you regarding special product offers, sales, promotions, or other information about these third parties' products and services that may be of interest to you. Please do not participate in a co-branded or co-sponsored promotion/contest if you do not wish to disclose your Personal Information with the third parties involved in such promotions/contests.

We will share your Personal Information and non-identifying and aggregate information with our operational service providers and JCI Affiliates, to help us serve you better and to perform functions on our behalf in order to support our business and operation of our Sites, features and activities, as necessary, including without limitation to provide online services, such as news, weather and traffic alerts; to provide shopping services and fulfill and process orders for products and services; to process credit card payments; to send communications to you; to facilitate promotional marketing campaigns; to facilitate advertisements on our Sites; to provide technical support services, and to host our Sites on third party servers.

We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information to protect the security of our Sites and databases; to protect JBG and JCI Affiliates against liability and harm; to respond to subpoenas, judicial processes, or government requests and investigations; to act in respect of an emergency that threatens life, health or security of an individual; to assist in the investigation of a contravention of a law or our Sites' Terms and Conditions for Use; if we believe in good faith that the law requires it or authorizes it; or in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger, assignment, re-organization or financing of all or any portion of JBG, JCI or any of the business or assets or shares of JBG or JCI Affiliates thereof in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services. 

We reserve the right to fully use, share, disclose and process any non-Personal Information collected via our Sites or offline.

**What choices do you have about the collection, use and sharing of your Personal Information?**

If you do not want to receive email and other direct marketing communications from us regarding special product offers, sales, promotions, or other information about JCI Affiliates or our Advertisers' products and services, you may choose to opt-out of receiving such communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe links in certain email communications from us or by otherwise notifying our Privacy Administrator of your opt-out choice by using our contact information below. 

If we plan to share your Personal Information directly with non-affiliated third parties such as Advertisers for purposes of delivering promotional or direct marketing materials directly to you or providing particular online services to you, you will be asked to provide your affirmative consent ("opt-in") first. If you have opted in to such use of your Personal Information, you may withdraw your consent at any time ("opt-out"), unless there are certain restrictions as stated in this Privacy Policy, Terms of Conditions of Use, Official Rules or are disclosed in advance. For withdrawal of your consent please contact us using our information below and we will take reasonable measures to avoid sharing your Personal Information in the future. However, please note that non-affiliated third parties are independent from us, and if you wish to stop all communications from such third parties, you will need to address such issues with the third parties directly. 

**What do you need to know about links to other websites operated by third parties?**

Our Sites contains a variety of content and functionality and may provide links to other third party websites, including JCI Affiliate websites. Despite these linkages or any references to our business and JBG at those websites, this Privacy Policy applies only to JBG. This Privacy Policy does not apply to other portions of our internal network or to any external websites. Please note that you are solely responsible for your interactions with external websites and third parties to which our Sites provide you access, such as by clicking on a link. The presence of a link to a third party website does not constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the third party content, goods, services available through, or contained on, the website or the third party's business or privacy practices. By use of our Sites, you have agreed that you will use the hyperlinks to third party websites at your own risk. 

**How can you access, update or delete your Personal Information?**

If you wish to update or correct any Personal Information you have previously provided to us, you may enter your username and password and access your account via these Sites, or contact us by using our contact information below. **[ALL DIVISIONS TO CONFIRM SPECIFIC PROCESS]** You may also request to remove your Personal Information from our Company records to the extent technically feasible, electronic or otherwise, however, certain records and Personal Information must be retained for tax or regulatory purposes. Additionally, our network system may not allow the deletion of all Personal Information. If we are not able to purge all Personal Information, we can remove such data from an active field or folder. We will update your Personal Information where appropriate, and we reserve the right to retain Personal Information obtained previously to verify your identity or take other actions that we believe are appropriate. 

We also reserve the right to deny access to any user if we believe there is a question about your identity. And if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries. 

**What security measures do we take to safeguard your Personal Information?**

The security and confidentiality of your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect your Personal Information. If we collect Sensitive Personal Information such as credit or debit card account numbers, we will do so using an industry-standard secured transmission process. However, no security measures are impenetrable, and transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure or error-free. As a result, we do not, and cannot, guarantee the security of any Personal Information but we will take reasonable measures.

Also, it is your responsibility to safeguard any username or password that you may have received in connection with our Sites, and to notify us if you ever suspect that the security and confidentiality of your username or password and associated account has been compromised in any way. You are solely responsible for any use of our Sites via your username and password.

**How will you know if we make changes to this Privacy Policy?**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time and in our sole discretion without advance notice to you. If this Privacy Policy changes, the revised Privacy Policy will be posted at the "Privacy Policy" link on our Sites' home page. In the event that the change is significant or material, we will notify such a change by revising the link on the home page to read "Privacy Policy - Updated." Please check the Privacy Policy frequently and particularly before you submit additional Personal Information via our Sites. If you do not agree to the changes in the Privacy Policy, you understand, acknowledge and agree that your only recourse is to stop using our Sites. Your continued use of our Sites constitutes acceptance of such changes in the Privacy Policy, except where further steps are required by applicable law. The effective date of this Privacy Policy is noted in the beginning of this Privacy Policy.
