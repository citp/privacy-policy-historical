              <h2> Web Privacy Statement</h2> 
                        <p><strong>James Madison University</strong></p>
            <h3>Commitment to Privacy </h3>
            <p class="purple_fade_box">James Madison University values individuals' privacy and actively seeks to preserve the privacy rights of those who share information with us. Your trust is important to us and we believe you have the right to know how information submitted through a university website is handled.</p>
            <p>As explanation of JMU's online information policy and practices 
              and to assist you in better protecting your privacy, we provide 
              the following privacy notice. </p>
            <h3>Privacy Notice</h3>
            <p class="purple_fade_box">The following information explains the Internet privacy policy 
              and practices the university has adopted for its official websites. 
              However, in legal terms, it shall not be construed as a contractual 
              promise, and the university reserves the right to amend it at any 
              time without notice. Privacy and public records obligations of the 
              university are governed by applicable Virginia statutes, including, 
              but not limited to, the Virginia Privacy Protection Act of 1976, 
              the Virginia Freedom Of Information Act, and by any applicable U.S. 
              federal laws. </p>
            <h3>Site Definitions</h3>
            <p class="purple_fade_box">University Web space includes hundreds of sites with varying levels 
              of university involvement and commitment as outlined below.<br><br>
              <strong>Official University Websites</strong><br>
              </p><dir> 
                <p>Except as noted, the information in this privacy notice applies 
                  to all official James Madison University websites, which are 
                  defined as – the Web pages of university colleges, schools, 
                  departments, divisions or other units and any other sites specifically 
                  designated as official by a vice president, dean, department 
                  head or director. Official pages are generally recognizable 
                  by a standard page footer carrying the university logo, contact 
                  information and reference to this privacy statement. <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/" title="JMU home page">Click here </a> to see a sample of this footer on the JMU home page.</p>
            </dir>
              <strong>Unofficial Websites</strong>
              <dir> 
                <p>Within the James Madison University domain – signified 
                  by the address "jmu.edu" or within the range of Internet protocol 
                  addresses assigned to James Madison University – you may 
                  find websites over which the university has no editorial responsibility 
                  or control. Such sites are considered unofficial and include, 
                  but are not limited to, the Web pages of individual faculty 
                  members or students and the Web pages of student organizations 
                  and other entities not formally a part of the university. While 
                  JMU encourages compliance with this Web Privacy Statement at 
                  such sites, in order to better understand the policies and practices 
                  under which they operate, please consult the privacy statements 
                  of individual sites or seek information directly from the persons 
                  responsible for those sites </p>
              </dir>
            <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
            <p class="purple_fade_box">The Web Privacy Statement speaks generally to the information collected 
              by or submitted to official James Madison University websites (see 
              the definition above). Still the amount and type of information 
              collected may vary somewhat from site to site. Therefore, in addition 
              to this general explanation of policy and practice, the university 
              encourages colleges, schools, departments, divisions and other units 
              contributing to its official Web pages to post, as necessary, more 
              specific privacy notices pertaining to the collection and use of 
              any personal information associated exclusively with those pages. 
              Thus it is wise for you to read page-specific notices to ensure 
              you understand the privacy policies and practices applicable to 
              a particular site.</p>
            <p>When you access official JMU Web pages, certain client information 
              and essential and nonessential technical information (collectively 
              referred to as access information) listed below is automatically 
              collected. No other information is collected through our official 
              websites except when you deliberately send it to us (for example, 
              by clicking a link to send us an email). Examples of the information 
              you might choose to send us are listed below as "optional information." 
            </p>
            <p><strong>
              Access Information (automatically collected)</strong>
            </p>
              <ul class="square"> 
                <li>Client information: the Internet domain and Internet address 
                  of the computer you are using. </li>
                <li>Essential technical information: identification of the page 
                  or service you are requesting, type of browser and operating 
                  system you are using; and the date and time of access. </li>
                <li>Nonessential technical information: the Internet address of 
                  the website from which you linked directly to our website, 
                  and the "cookie information" used to direct and tailor information 
                  based on your entry path to the site. </li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Optional information (deliberately sent)</strong>
            </p>
              <ul class="square"> 
                <li>when you send us an email: your name, email address, and 
                  the content of your email.</li>
                  
                  <li>When you complete online forms: all the data you choose to fill in or confirm. This may include user names and passwords or any other data you choose to type into a form on the JMU site as well as links you create from third-party sites to JMU web pages (such as clicking a Facebook 'like' button). </li>
              </ul>
            
            <h3>The Way We Use Information</h3>
            <p>As a general rule, JMU does not track individual visitor profiles. 
              We do, however, analyze aggregate traffic/access information for 
              resource management and site planning purposes. JMU reserves the 
              right to use log detail to investigate resource management or security 
              concerns.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Access Information:</strong>
            </p>
            <dir> 
                <p>Client information is used to route the requested Web page 
                  to your computer for viewing. In theory, the requested Web page 
                  and the routing information could be discerned by other entities 
                  involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not 
                  control the privacy practices of those entities. </p>
                <p>We may keep client information from our systems indefinitely 
                  after the Web page is transmitted, but we do not cross-reference 
                  it to the individuals who browse our website. However, on rare 
                  occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, 
                  logs of access information are retained to permit a security 
                  investigation. In such cases the logs may be further analyzed 
                  or forwarded together with any other relevant information in 
                  our possession to law enforcement agencies. </p>
                <p>Under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, records in our 
                  possession at the time of a Freedom of Information Request might 
                  be subject to inspection by or disclosure to members of the 
                  public. As indicated above, client information may be retained 
                  after transmission of the requested Web page and might be available 
                  for inspection.</p>
                <p>Essential and nonessential technical information lets us respond 
                  to your request in an appropriate format [or in a personalized 
                  manner] and helps us plan website improvements. To expedite 
                  this process, some official James Madison University websites 
                  use "cookies." Usually a cookie enables the university website 
                  to tailor what you see according to the way you entered the 
                  site (i.e., if you entered by pushing a button identifying yourself 
                  as a student, your subsequent views of information might be 
                  tailored for student audiences).</p>
                <p>We also use non-identifying and aggregate information to better 
                  design our website. For example, we may determine that X number 
                  of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that 
                  Y number of men and Z number of women filled out a particular 
                  registration form. But we do not disclose information that could 
                  identify those specific individuals. </p>
                  <p>Many JMU sites use Google Analytics or other similar services to analyze web traffic for design purposes.  In such cases, the access information described above may be shared with the vendor(s) providing the analytical service. JMU does not control the privacy policies of these vendors.</p>
            </dir>
            <p>
              <strong>Optional Information:</strong>
            </p>
            <dir> 
                <p>Optional information enables us to provide services or information 
                  tailored more specifically to your needs, to forward your message 
                  or inquiry to another entity that is better able to do so, and 
                  to plan website improvements.</p>
                <p>We use the information you provide about yourself or about 
                  someone else when placing a request for service only to complete 
                  that order or request. We do not share this information with 
                  outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete 
                  that order or request. </p>
                <p>We generally use return email addresses only to answer the email we receive. By university and state policy, such addresses are not shared with outside parties.</p>
                <p>Finally, we never use or share the optional 
                  information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the purpose 
                  described without a clear notice on the particular site and 
                  without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise 
                  prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
              </dir>
             
            <h3>Providing Information is Your Choice </h3>
            <p>There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information 
              at our website. However, our website will not work without routing 
              information and the essential technical information. Failure of 
              your browser to provide nonessential technical information will 
              not prevent your use of our website but may prevent certain features 
              from working. For any optional information that is requested at 
              the website, failure to provide the requested information will 
              mean that the particular feature or service associated with that

            <h3>Our Commitment To Data Security</h3>
            <p>James Madison University is dedicated to preventing unauthorized 
              data access, maintaining data accuracy, and ensuring the appropriate 
              use of information. We strive to put in place appropriate physical, 
              electronic, and managerial safeguards to secure the information 
              we collect online. These security practices are consistent with 
              the policies of the university and with the laws and regulatory 
              practices of the Commonwealth of Virginia as they are appropriate to JMU.</p>
