# Juicy Studio: Privacy Policy

Juicy Studio has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site. 

## Registration

No information is collected to pass on to third-parties. Juicy Studio is in no way interested in the real identity of any of the members, and allows its members to use aliases rather than their real names. The only data we do require is an email address. 

## Email Address

Email addresses are required so we can initially send you a password. You will also have an opportunity to receive Techmails, which will be sent to your email account. For this option, you must opt-in by selecting the "Receive Techmails" option in your profile. Once your account is set up, you may remove your email address from your profile if you wish. The email addresses are not published on any part of the site, and under no circumstances are the email addresses passed on to a third-party. Juicy Studio does not attempt to collect email addresses from visitors. 

## IP Addresses

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. 

## Cookies

Cookies are used to identify the last time a member of the board logged in. This enables us to display messages that have been added since you last logged on in bold. If you are not a member, we do not track times. Cookies are also used to allow you to change the background colours used throughout the site. 

## Responsibility

Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your personal details. Information disclosed on the message boards is public information. As such, members are requested not to divulge their personal information on any of the message boards. 

The message boards are regularly checked by Moderators, but Juicy Studio is unable to vouch for the usefulness and validity of information posted on the board. The messages express the views of the author, and are not necessarily those of Juicy Studio. 

## Links

There are several links to other sites relative to the content of Juicy Studio. Juicy Studio is in no way responsible for the privacy practices of these external links. 

By using this Web site, you are agreeing that you will not post offensive messages, or violate any law. 

## Contacting the Web Site

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact [gez@juicystudio.com](mailto:gez@juicystudio.com?subject=Juicy%20Studio%20Privacy).
