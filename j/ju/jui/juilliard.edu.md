# Juilliard School Web Site Privacy Statement | The Juilliard School

Thank you for visiting The Juilliard School Web site. We have a firm commitment to your privacy. The policies outlined herein pertain to the Juilliard Web site ([www.juilliard.edu](http://www.juilliard.edu/)) and the Juilliard Alumni Online Community.

Please note: Juilliard's online application form is hosted by the Hobsons Inc. and is governed by that organization's own privacy policies, which may be read online at [app.applyyourself.com/Common/AppSecurity.asp](https://app.applyyourself.com/Common/AppSecurity.asp).

The Juilliard School has taken considerable precautions to ensure security for our online visitors. However, since data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure, we cannot ensure the absolute security of the information that you transmit or provide to us.

This online privacy statement explains how we handle information we may learn about you from your visit to our Web site. It is intended to inform you of the ways in which this site collects information, how that information may be used, and the ways in which we protect any information that you voluntarily provide to us.

There are four types of information that this site may collect during your visit: Web visit logs, network traffic logs, cookies, and information that you have voluntarily provided.

### Web Visit Logs

Logs are kept of the IP (Internet Protocol) address and country of the computer visiting the site; the page visited; the type of browser used; and the operating system of the computer. Personally identifiable information such as individuals' names, addresses, or phone numbers do not appear in the Web Visit Logs.

### Network Traffic Logs

Logs are kept of network traffic within the Juilliard network. These logs are never made available to any party outside the Juilliard I.T. (Information Technology) Department.

### Cookies

A cookie is a small amount of data that a Web site uses to identify whether a browser has visited it recently. The Web site deposits that data into a browser during a visit and in a subsequent visit attempts to retrieve it. No Web site can read another Web site's cookies. Some Juilliard Web sites such as the Juilliard Alumni Online Community set cookies in the browser. Cookies need to be enabled in your browser security settings in order to allow the full and proper functioning of these Web sites. These cookies originate on the Web server and may contain personal information existing on the Web server. For example, if you have provided your zip code to a Web site at any point, it could be made part of a cookie. No other Web server can access these cookies; only the server by which they were set has access to them.

### Sharing Information Voluntarily Provided by You

Juilliard occasionally shares aggregated demographic information with partners and vendors. An example of such information sharing would be through a report giving statistics concerning the geographical distribution of persons requesting information from the School. The information is abstracted from the data and is presented in a generalized fashion that does not reveal the individual identities of the people behind the statistical profile.

Whenever Juilliard partners with outside vendors to provide specific services for the School, our agreements with those parties prohibit them from using personally identifiable information about you except for the sole purpose of providing those services.

When you sign up for a mailing list or make a contribution from this Web site, Juilliard will use information provided in order to contact you about activities of The Juilliard School. From time to time, we may share this information with carefully selected partners. Should you decide that you prefer that your information not be used for these purposes, you may notify us of your preference by writing to us at [development@juilliard.edu](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=development@juilliard.edu), and we will honor your request.

### SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

We take the necessary security measures to protect your information and keep it confidential. When you submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and offline.

Sensitive personal information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your Web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform specific jobs are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

### Sending Us E-Mail

You also may decide to send us personally identifiable information, for example, in an e-mail message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a Web form that provides us with this information. We use personally identifiable information from e-mail primarily to respond to your requests. We may forward your e-mail to other employees of the School who are better able to answer your questions. We may also use your e-mail to contact you in the future about programs that may be of interest to you.

### Links to Other Sites

The Juilliard Web site may provide links to other Web sites or resources. We have no control over these sites and are not responsible for their content or policies. In addition, we do not endorse the services or goods offered by any linked site or third party on our Web site.

### Juilliard Alumni Online Community

Members of the Juilliard Alumni Online Community voluntarily provide us with personal contact information and may occasionally receive electronic mailings from The Juilliard School. Alumni address, phone, and e-mail contact information are available exclusively to the members of the Juilliard Alumni Online Community via a password-protected logon. This information may be made available to other alumni through the Online Alumni Directory, but participation in the Directory is voluntary: alumni are given the opportunity to opt out of the Alumni Directory when they register for the Online Community. Once they have opted in, they then have the chance to determine what personal data to display to their classmates on an item-by-item basis by unchecking the "Make Private" checkbox on their Profile Update form, which defaults to private (that is, "Do Not Display") for all fields except alumni last names and class years.

The School does give some personally identifiable information to its affinity partners — companies that provide benefits to the alumni community — on a one-time only basis. Alumni may request at any time to be removed from the mailing list given to Juilliard's affinity partners by e-mailing the Office of Alumni Relations ([alumni@juilliard.edu](mailto:alumni@juilliard.edu)), or by phone at (212) 799-5000, ext. 344.

### Online Alumni Profile Updates and Donations

If you complete the profile update form in the Online Alumni Community and share your personally identifiable information, this information will be used only to provide you with more individually targeted content. We may use your contact information to send further information about our organization or to contact you when necessary. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings by e-mailing the Office of Alumni Relations ([alumni@juilliard.edu](mailto:alumni@juilliard.edu)), or by phone at (212) 799-5000, ext. 344.

### Questions About Our Policies

When you sign up for a mailing list or make a contribution from this Web site, Juilliard will use information provided in order to contact you about activities of The Juilliard School. From time to time, we may share this information with carefully selected partners. Should you decide that you prefer that your information not be used for these purposes, you may notify us of your preference by writing to us at [development@juilliard.edu](mailto:development@juilliard.edu), and we will honor your request.

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, please e-mail the Juilliard Publications Office at [publications@juilliard.edu](mailto:publications@juilliard.edu), or, for questions about the Juilliard Alumni Online Community, e-mail [alumni@juilliard.edu.](mailto:alumni@juilliard.edu)
