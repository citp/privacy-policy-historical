    WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF JUDY'S BOOK, OUR SERVICES OR THIS AGREEMENT. IN ANY EVENT, BY ACCEPTING THE JUDY'S BOOK TERMS OF USE YOU SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT WE AND OUR SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN $500.

    <b>Governing Law / Arbitration<br>
    </b>
    <br>
&nbsp;This agreement is governed by Washington law as such laws apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Washington between Washington residents. Any claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or Judy's Book shall be settled by binding arbitration in King County, WA in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's commercial arbitration rules. Any such claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, not consolidated with another party's claim. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court with jurisdiction, and the arbitrator's award shall not be appealable or reviewable except as permitted by Washington law. However, (a) each of us may seek interim relief from a King County, WA court to protect the party's rights or property while arbitration is pending, and (b) at our option, we may bypass arbitration in cases of fraud or other crimes against us, interference with our technical operations or violations of our rights or property.

    <b>General

    <br>
    </b>
    <br>
    JUDY'S BOOK AND ITS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." We do not promise or warrant that any aspect of the site or system will work properly or will be continuously available. This agreement does not create any agency, partnership, JV, employment or franchise relationship. Because you are not an employee, minimum wage laws do not apply to your relationship with Judy's Book. Any unenforceable portion of this agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the remaining portions shall be given full effect. Our failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive our right to act with respect to that or other circumstances. We shall be excused for any problem due to a factor beyond our control. Our suppliers are third-party beneficiaries of this agreement.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Privacy Policy<br>
    </b>
    <br>

Judy's Book is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This privacy policy explains when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our web site located at www.judysbook.com (the "Site"). By using the Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us. Please carefully review this policy so you understand our data privacy practices.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>What is Personal Information?

    <br>
    </b>
    <br>
    Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number, and information about that individual's activities when directly linked to that person such as information about his or her use of the Site. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Personal Information We Collect

    <br>
    </b>
    <br>
    We collect personal information in a number of ways when you visit our web site. For example, we collect personal information when you: (1) register and set up an account; (2) sign up for any of our e-mail newsletters; (3) post a review; (4) contact us by e-mail for any reason or (5) Make a transaction through our site. When you visit our web site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and purchases. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>How We Use Personal Information.

    <br>
    </b>
    <br>
    In general, we use personal information to process your requests and provide you with service, ensure you receive any cash back or commissions that you are owed or to inform you about other products or services we think will be of interest. When we use personal information in our marketing efforts, we provide you with options (See Control of Personal Information below) and do not disclose the information to third parties except as described in this Policy. Personal information provided online may be linked together or merged with other personal information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our products or services and those of our partners. In addition, if we receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you. In either case, this Policy governs this information.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Content and Ratings

    <br>
    </b>
    <br>
    You can publish reviews, deals, comments and other content. Members can choose to rate products, services or other reviews, and to connect to other members. As an unregistered visitor, we may allow you to rate products and/or reviews.

    <br>
    <br>
    Your reviews and deals are displayed publicly. Your member name is automatically displayed with reviews, deals and comments you publish, and if other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your publications or publish their own comments to your reviews.

    <br>
    <br>
    You may also elect to participate in special programs such as City Editor or Deal editor. Should you elect to participate, we may contact you or disclose data about you and your activities in ways not described in this statement.

    <br>
    <br>
    We, and our licensees, can republish your content as described in the Judy's Book terms of use. We publish review and deal content and use them to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and merchandise reviews and deals. We use your reviews and deals to personalize the site and identify/feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular reviews, deals and members. While we don't expect to transfer the complete review, deal and member database to others (except as contemplated elsewhere in this statement), we use the database throughout our networks and to generate results for others.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Email Tools

    <br>
    </b>
    <br>
    If you send emails through our site, your email will include your email address and any personal message you include. However, these emails aren't private communications.

    <br>
    <b>Communicating with Other Users

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Security

    <br>
    </b>
    <br>
    We have put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our control.

    <b>Sharing of Personal Information</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    We do not sell, rent or share personal information with third parties without your prior consent except in the limited circumstances described in this Policy. We may share personal information with third-party vendors who assist us in performing functions necessary to operate our business. These functions may include, without limitation, Website hosting, credit card transaction processing and data entry. We limit the information shared with our third-party vendors to that which we believe is necessary to carry out those functions. Moreover, we require them to comply with our privacy practices, and not to use the information for other purposes except as required by law. We are not responsible for any failure on their part to comply with our privacy practices, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.

    <br>
    <br>
    In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Judy's Book, our users, our employees or the public. Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personal information when posting reviews or other content to the Site, this information may be collected and used by others. You agree that we shall bear no responsibility for any such disclosures. We recommend you be cautious in giving out personal information to others in public online forums.

    <br>

    <b>Cookies, IP Addresses and URLs

    <br>
    </b>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Automatically Collected Information: We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us.

    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Cookies: Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive by a web site when you visit.
