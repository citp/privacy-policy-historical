# Terms of Use & Privacy - Judy's Book

**Terms of Use  
**   
Welcome to Judy's Book! This agreement describes the legal framework in which you participate on Judy's Book, what your rights and responsibilities are and what you can expect from us, and outlines our privacy policy.   
**  
Eligibility  
**   
Use of and membership of Judy's Book is void where prohibited. By using Judy's Book, you represent and warrant that (a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (c) you are 13 years of age or older; and (d) your use of Judy's Book does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Your profile may be deleted and your membership may be terminated without warning, if we believe that you are under 13 years of age. 

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Judy's Book members. Judy's Book reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other members. 

You agree to comply with our site rules, including, specifically, the Judy's Book Privacy Policy, which are incorporated into this agreement, and with all laws and regulations applicable to your access and use of Judy's Book and publishing your Content. Unless we explicitly say otherwise, you may not use any automated means (such as scripts) to access Judy's Book or collect information from it. 

**Content  
**   
Please choose carefully the information you post on Judy's Book and that you provide to other users. Your Judy's Book profile may not include the following items: telephone numbers, street addresses, photographs containing nudity, or obscene, lewd, excessively violent, harassing, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable subject matter. Despite this prohibition, information provided by other Judy's Book Members (for instance, in their profile) may contain inaccurate, inappropriate, offensive or sexually explicit material, products or services, and Judy's Book assumes no responsibility or liability for this material. If you become aware of misuse of the Judy's Book site by any person, please contact Judy's Book at [info@judysbookteam.com](mailto:info@judysbookteam.com). 

Judy's Book may delete any content that in the sole judgment of Judy's Book violates this agreement or which may be offensive, illegal or violate the rights, harm, or threaten the safety of any person. Judy's Book assumes no responsibility for monitoring the Judy's Book site for inappropriate content or conduct. If at any time Judy's Book chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor the Judy's Book site, Judy's Book nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate content, and no responsibility for the conduct of the user submitting any such content. 

You are solely responsible for the content that you post on or through the Judy's Book site, any material or information that you transmit to other members, and for your interactions with other users. Judy's Book does not endorse and has no control over the content. Content is not necessarily reviewed by Judy's Book prior to posting and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or policies of Judy's Book. Judy's Book makes no warranties, express or implied, as to the content or to the accuracy and reliability of the content or any material or information that you transmit to other members. 

You retain all ownership rights to content you publish on Judy's Book (your "Content"). However, you grant Judy's Book a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and assignable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such Content throughout the world in any media. You grant Judy's Book and its affiliates and sublicensees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such Content, if they choose. We can publish all or teaser portions of your Content online and offline and permit others to do the same. We ask that you refer or provide links to Judy's Book if you choose to republish your Content elsewhere and that you do not publish the same items of Content on both Judy's Book and other product or service review or recommendation sites. 

If you believe content on Judy's Book infringes your copyright or other intellectual property rights, or is defamatory, you can contact our agent for service of notice at [info@judysbookteam.com](mailto:info@judysbookteam.com). Please make sure your notice meets the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requirements. 

**Termination  
**   
You can cancel your account at any time by contacting Judy's Book customer service. We can cancel your account, or otherwise refuse service to you, at any time for any reason (including repeat infringement). Judy's Book may choose to assume that you intended to terminate your account if you do not access it for more than three months.

**Governing Law / Arbitration  
**   
 This agreement is governed by Washington law as such laws apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Washington between Washington residents. Any claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or Judy's Book shall be settled by binding arbitration in King County, WA in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's commercial arbitration rules. Any such claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, not consolidated with another party's claim. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court with jurisdiction, and the arbitrator's award shall not be appealable or reviewable except as permitted by Washington law. However, (a) each of us may seek interim relief from a King County, WA court to protect the party's rights or property while arbitration is pending, and (b) at our option, we may bypass arbitration in cases of fraud or other crimes against us, interference with our technical operations or violations of our rights or property. Integration This agreement and our privacy policy (which is part of this agreement) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any other agreements or understandings (oral or written), between you and us with respect to their subject matters. We can amend this agreement either by emailing you about the amended terms, which take effect when we send you the email, or by displaying amended terms to you when you log in to Judy's Book, which take effect when we post them. Otherwise, this agreement may be amended only by a writing physically signed by both us and you. 

**General  
**   
JUDY'S BOOK AND ITS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." We do not promise or warrant that any aspect of the site or system will work properly or will be continuously available. This agreement does not create any agency, partnership, JV, employment or franchise relationship. Because you are not an employee, minimum wage laws do not apply to your relationship with Judy's Book. Any unenforceable portion of this agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the remaining portions shall be given full effect. Our failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive our right to act with respect to that or other circumstances. We shall be excused for any problem due to a factor beyond our control. Our suppliers are third-party beneficiaries of this agreement. 

**Privacy Policy  
**   
Judy's Book is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This privacy policy explains when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our web site located at www.judysbook.com (the "Site"). By using the Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy, as modified from time to time by us. Please carefully review this policy so you understand our data privacy practices. 

**What is Personal Information?  
**   
Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other account number, and information about that individual's activities when directly linked to that person such as information about his or her use of the Site. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Site. 

**Personal Information We Collect  
**   
We collect personal information in a number of ways when you visit our web site. For example, we collect personal information when you: (1) register and set up an account; (2) sign up for any of our e-mail newsletters; (3) post a review; (4) contact us by e-mail for any reason or (5) Make a transaction through our site. When you visit our web site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring web site, and the time and date of your visit and purchases. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only. 

**How We Use Personal Information.  
**   
In general, we use personal information to process your requests and provide you with service, ensure you receive any cash back or commissions that you are owed or to inform you about other products or services we think will be of interest. When we use personal information in our marketing efforts, we provide you with options (See Control of Personal Information below) and do not disclose the information to third parties except as described in this Policy. Personal information provided online may be linked together or merged with other personal information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our products or services and those of our partners. In addition, if we receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you. In either case, this Policy governs this information. 

**Content and Ratings  
**   
You can publish reviews, deals, comments and other content. Members can choose to rate products, services or other reviews, and to connect to other members. As an unregistered visitor, we may allow you to rate products and/or reviews. 

Your reviews and deals are displayed publicly. Your member name is automatically displayed with reviews, deals and comments you publish, and if other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your publications or publish their own comments to your reviews. 

You may also elect to participate in special programs such as City Editor or Deal editor. Should you elect to participate, we may contact you or disclose data about you and your activities in ways not described in this statement. 

We, and our licensees, can republish your content as described in the Judy's Book terms of use. We publish review and deal content and use them to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and merchandise reviews and deals. We use your reviews and deals to personalize the site and identify/feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular reviews, deals and members. While we don't expect to transfer the complete review, deal and member database to others (except as contemplated elsewhere in this statement), we use the database throughout our networks and to generate results for others. 

**Email Tools  
**   
If you send emails through our site, your email will include your email address and any personal message you include. However, these emails aren't private communications. We do not retain, in any easily-retrievable way, the addresses you are emailing. You may not use these tools to send spam or content that violates the user agreement.

**   
You may not harvest personal data (including email addresses) from the site, and specifically you may not use email addresses displayed on the site to ask users to join or contribute to your services.

In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Judy's Book, our users, our employees or the public. Information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personal information when posting reviews or other content to the Site, this information may be collected and used by others.
