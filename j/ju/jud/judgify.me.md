# Privacy Policy | Judgify

**Last Revised: January 2nd, 2015**

This statement applies to Judgify´s information collection and use policies with respect to use of the Sites and the users of its Platform (as such terms are   defined   in   the   Site´s   Terms   of   Use,   available at [http://www.judgify.com/terms](https://www.judgify.me/l/terms) located at [www.judgify.me](http://www.judgify.me/l). By using the Site or the Platform, you consent to the data practices described in this Statement.

We encourage you to read our policy carefully, and feel free to [contact us](mailto:support@judgify.me) if you have any questions regarding its contents. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time – we encourage you to review it periodically.

Privacy policy principles are guided by the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) which will be enforced in Singapore in July 2014 to govern the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Data by organisations in a manner that recognizes both the right of individuals to protect their data and the need of organisations to collect, use or disclose personal data for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.

The PDPA has made a further distinction between Personal Data and Business Contact Information which specifies the scope of application of the Act itself.

"Personal Data" refers to data about an individual who can be identified from that data; or from that data and other information that the organisation is likely to have access. On the other hand, "Business Contact Information" is defined as "an individual´s name, position name or title, business telephone number, business address, business electronic mail address or business fax number and any other similar information about the individual, not provided by the individual solely for his personal purposes."

For the avoidance of doubt, the PDPA does not cover Business Contact Information.

By using the Site or the Platform, you have consented to our collecting and using the Business Contact Information that you provide to us in accordance with this privacy policy. You will also be deemed to have read and accepted this privacy policy.

**Which information we may collect on our Users?**
