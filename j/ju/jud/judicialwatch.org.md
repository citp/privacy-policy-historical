your personal information will be treated by Judicial Watch. Judicial Watch reserves the right to

from time to time.

    data about individual visitors, such as the visitor’s name, password, user-name, screen
    preferences, the pages of a site viewed by the visitor, and the advertisements viewed or
    clicked by the visitor. When the visitor revisits the Site, Judicial Watch may recognize the
    visitor by the Internet cookie and customize the visitor’s experience accordingly. Visitors
    may decline Internet cookies, if any, by using the appropriate feature of their Web client
    software, if available; however, this may impair certain features of the Site.

Judicial Watch may use personally identifiable information in a number of ways, including but
not limited to:

    Watch (and its officers, directors, employees and agents), our users, or others.
