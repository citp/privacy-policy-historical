# Judici Privacy Policy

|  | **Judici.com Privacy Policy**

This statement sets forth the privacy policy for Judici.com (the Website) and describes the practices Judici.com follows to respect the privacy of all authorized users of this site.

For access to key services, Judici.com requires users to subscribe before using the Website. During subscription, we collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, phone number, address and email address. Initially, this information can be cross-checked to validate the subscriber's identity. From then on, your e-mail address is used as your user ID to verify that you are an authorized user of the Website. We may occasionally need to contact you using this information, in order to address matters relating to your subscription. We may also contact you for purposes of telling you about other products and services we offer, though you may at any time choose to opt out of such contacts.

When we ask users provide such information, its transmission is encrypted and protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While on the subscription page, the lock icon on the bottom of your Web browser becomes locked. You can also identify the secure connection by looking at the URL, which will begin with https: (instead of http:).

Corrections or updates to your contact information may be made at any time by accessing [Subscriber Preferences.](https://web.archive.org/user/preferences.jsp)

The information you provide is used only for internal statistical analysis and research purposes to help us understand who is using our site and become better equipped to serve your needs.

Judici does not sell, rent, distribute or disclose your personally identifiable information collected at subscription to any third parties; provided however, that Judici reserves the right to disclose such information as may be required by law.
