			<ol class="lowerAlpha">
				<li><strong>Subscribers</strong> are users of any Subscription Service offered through the Website, as identified in <a href="http://www.judici.com/service/permalinkJSA0808.jsp">http://www.judici.com/service/permalinkJSA0808.jsp</a></li>

			<strong>The Information Judici.com Collects</strong>
			<ol class="lowerAlpha">
				<li>If you are a Subscriber and/or E-Pay User, Judici.com will collect your contact data ("Contact Data") including for example, your name, phone number, home address and email address, and data necessary to execute a payment transaction ("Payment Data"), including for example, payment card number, billing address, card expiration date and payment amount.</li>

				<li>In addition, for all users of the Website, we collect the Internet protocol ("IP") address associated with the computer or Internet Service Provider you are using to visit the Website. As you browse the Website, we gather data that shows what pages you visited on the Website and how long you used various Website features and Services, collectively known as "Clickstream Data".
