This privacy policy addresses how information is collected, stored, and utilized through our website, [www.Juul.com](http://www.juul.com/) and/or [www.JUULLabs.com](http://www.juullabs.com/) (individually a “Website” or collectively the “Websites”) and any mobile application we may offer in the future which is linked to this Policy (the “App”) (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using our Services, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information, as applicable, as described in this Privacy Policy and the Websites’ respective Terms of Service. 

JUUL Labs reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy. See the section captioned “Changes to this Privacy Policy” below.

### 1\. INFORMATION COLLECTED

JUUL Labs holds our customer base in the highest regards and is dedicated to providing the best experience on our Services. In order to offer an enjoyable and premium experience on our Websites, we collect information which can personally identify you (e.g., name, address and email) and information that is about you but that does not identify you individually (e.g., aggregate information on the number and frequency of visits to various pages of the Websites). The categories of information we collect can include: 

**Information that you provide to us**

We may collect personal information that you provide to us directly, such as your name, phone number, location, payment information, and e-mail address when you when you register on our Websites, purchase a product, sign up for our Newsletter mailing list, or otherwise communicate with us (e.g., via customer service). Account creation is required when purchasing products from the Websites. We may also collect any communications between you and JUUL Labs and any other information you provide to JUUL Labs. If you download and use our mobile App to access the Service, the App does not require you to enter any personally identifiable information, though you may voluntarily provide information to us through the App, for example, when you contact us through the App’s customer service link and provide to us your name, email address and any information you choose to include in the text of your message. 

We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Websites, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages. We may also send you service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, change or updates to features of the Websites, technical and security notices). 

**Information automatically collected**

We and our third party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Website, use our Service, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, file information and similar technologies (collectively, “tracking technologies”). For example, we may collect information such as your domain name, browser type, operating system, IP address, web pages viewed while visiting our site, links clicked, length of time spent on our Service, and reference website from which you accessed the Website. We may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Website and to understand more about the demographics of our users. In gathering this information we are able to enhance your experience when visiting our Website (including keeping your preferences and items placed in your shopping cart between visits) and to provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising. These cookies do not contain or track sensitive information such as your payment information. You may set your browser to not accept cookies; however, some features of the Websites may not function properly without the use of cookies. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time. 

If you download and use a mobile App to access our Service, we automatically collect certain types of information about your device and usage in several ways.

JUUL Labs may modify the information that it receives from the App at any time and will provide you notice of such changes by alerting you of a change to the Privacy Policy. 

The App may store information regarding usage of a compatible JUUL Labs device that you have linked to the App when the App is running or when a compatible JUUL Labs product is available to pair with the App. Such information may include identification and paring information to connect with a JUUL Labs product, log files, modes, settings, durations, error rates, and other information that may be useful to enhance the connectivity between a compatible JUUL Labs product and the APP. We do not link this Device Usage information to your personal information in our systems and this information is transmitted in an anonymous form and in an encrypted manner. If you do not opt-in to the Usage Recording Feature, the App will not collect any device usage information. If you do opt-in and choose to save certain settings or save user profiles in a durable, continuing manner for future sessions regardless of JUUL Labs product, this information may be retained by JUUL Labs.
