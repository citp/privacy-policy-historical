We will also use your personal information to provide you with a more effective user experience (such as by displaying customised, localised or recommended content we think you will be interested in). We collect and analyse information about the music you access to train our systems and provide more relevant content. By analysing the music you like, listen to and /or download, and your other actions on our site, we look to ensure technical functionality, improve the quality of our music and to develop new products.

Our use of your information in this way means that your experience of our site may be more tailored to you, and that the content you see on our site may differ from someone accessing the same site with a different history or browsing habits.
