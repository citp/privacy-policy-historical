# Privacy Policy | Juggle.com

Last updated: October 18, 2011

Juggle knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. **By visiting the Juggle site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.**

## What Personal Information About Users Does Juggle Gather?

The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at the Juggle site. Here are the types of information we gather:

**Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on the Juggle site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing the Juggle site for you, improving the Juggle site, and communicating with you.

**Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the Juggle site. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; e-mail address; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; and pages you viewed or searched for.

A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Juggle if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist.

## What About Cookies?

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as personalization.

The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the Juggle site’s features.

## Does Juggle Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share user information only as described below and with subsidiaries that Juggle controls.

**With Your Consent:** By accepting the Juggle Terms of Use Agreement, you expressly consent to our use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Notice.

**Participants:** As a requester or provider of services through the Juggle site, we may share certain information in order to facilitate the service relationship and to improve the Juggle site.

**Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include analyzing data, processing payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

**Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy additional services or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the event that Juggle or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

**Protection of Juggle and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our [Terms of Use Agreement](https://web.archive.org/corporate/terms-of-service/) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Juggle, our users, or others. This includes (1) exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction; and (2) if you are a provider of a service on the Juggle site, we will release your name and address only to requesters for whom you provide services so that those requestors can comply with tax and other legal obligations they might have. Obviously, however, **this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from users for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.**

## How Secure Is Information About Me?

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

## What Choices and Access Do I Have?

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of the Juggle site.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. 

## Children

Use of the Juggle site is limited to persons and entities that lawfully can enter into and form contracts under applicable law. It is not intended for use by minors.

## Participation Agreement, Notices, and Revisions

If you choose to visit Juggle, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Notice and our [Juggle Terms of Use Agreement](https://web.archive.org/corporate/terms-of-service/), including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Illinois. If you have any concern about privacy at Juggle, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/corporate/contact-us) with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.
