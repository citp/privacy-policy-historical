                    When you are asked for information while on the KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site, you are
                    sharing that information with KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE . In addition, some services are
                    provided in conjunction with partner companies. If your personal information is
                    being collected by another company other than KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE, you will be notified
                    at the time the information is collected. If you do not want your information shared,

                    Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to our sites may collect

                    With whom may your personal information be shared?</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may need to disclose your personal information to third party
                    vendors to fulfill product orders or prizes, to process mailings, or to process,
                    analyze and/or store data. We will attempt to ensure that these entities do not
                    use your personal information for any other purpose, and that they have agreed to
                    maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personal information
                    they obtain from us. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information
                    as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing
                    such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
                    you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for a KNOWLEDGE
                    ADVENTURE site or product or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally
                    or unintentionally) with KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's rights or property, other users of
                    a KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE site or product, or anyone else who could be harmed by your
                    activities.</p>
                <p class="description">
                    As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE
                    and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose
                    your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business
                    to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection
                    with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in
                    the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar
                    event, your personal information may be transferred to KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's successor
                    or assign.</p>
                <p class="description">
                    Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we
                    provide data, and as such we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same
                    privacy and security procedures as KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE.</p>
                <p class="description">
                    KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE sites may also have message boards and/or chat areas, where
                    users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message
                    board or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly

                    KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE attempts to allow you to control the way that we use personally

                    or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You
                    may contact us at Knowledge Adventure, Inc., 2377 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 302, Torrance,
                    CA 90501. You can also contact us by e-mailing us at opt-out@adventure.com . Please
                    indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we

                    <b>Note to Parents:</b> We believe protecting personal information about young children
                    is important. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their
                    real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when online. Teenagers
                    under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review
                    this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or
                    to raise any concerns.</p>

                    What are cookies and how are they used?</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allows Web sites to transfer bits
                    of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on
                    your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have
                    already registered. This allows us to speed up your future activities, saving the
                    time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration.
                    In addition, KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may use cookies to retrieve user information for
                    promotional, marketing or security purposes.</p>

                    What are Internet protocol addresses?</h5>
                <p class="description">
                    An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server
                    or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may track such IP addresses
                    for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, or to
                    prevent our servers from being abused.</p>

                    While KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE takes reasonable steps to secure your personal information,
                    no system is fault proof. If KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE's security systems are breached

                    and/or providing personal information to us, you agree that we can notify you electronically.
                    KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE may post a notice on the KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE Web Site if a security
                    breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view

                    you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you
                    may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive
                    free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving
                    electronic notice) you should notify us at privacy@adventure.com. If your email
                    address changes and you have provided KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE with personal information,
                    you should notify KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURE at privacy@adventure.com so that we can communicate
