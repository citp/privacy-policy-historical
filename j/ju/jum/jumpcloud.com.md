For example, they may handle our credit card processing, data management, email distribution, market research, information analysis, promotions management and delivery of eBooks and webinars. We provide our suppliers and preferred service providers with the information they need to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your information.

From time to time we might establish a business relationship with carefully selected persons or companies whom we believe trustworthy.

**PROTECTING YOUR INFORMATION**

We use a variety of security measures, including sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to maintain the safety of your personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secure networks and is only accessible to a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server.  Credit card numbers allow a user to subscribe to (and thus pay for) our business service. This data is protected and stored on our behalf by third party service providers. When you subscribe to the Service credit card data will be immediately encrypted, used once in a single authorization process and securely stored by the third party service provider. We are never able to access, see or display more than the card type, the last 4 digits of the credit card number, the name of the holder and the expiration date. The service providers do not save the CVV codes. Credit card numbers are used by service providers to initiate secure payments through the specific payment gateway at certain other service providers on a single occasion or a regular basis. Service providers charge the credit card and deposit money to our account. All processes adhere to PCI-DSS Level 1. Regardless of these efforts, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Our site may contain links to the websites of one or more third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other websites.

We want you to feel confident using the JumpCloud website but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.  Please refer to the [U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s web site](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data/idt.shtm) for information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

**NAVIGATION**

Like other interactive websites, we collect information about your use of our site and our services using cookies, log files, and techniques used to track who is reading a web page or e-mail, when, and from what computer, such as web bugs, web beacons, or pixel tags.

A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. Cookies allow you to place an order on our website and allow us to enhance and personalize your online browsing and shopping experience.

For example, we use cookies to:

  * Keep track of shopping cart and record session information
  * Keep track of login name/passwords
  * Recognize you when you return to our website
  * Keep track of click stream data (record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit)
  * Tailor web content to your users’ interests
  * Personalize the Site
  * So that the Service will function properly
  * Analyze visitor behavior
  * We may track information with pixel images on the Site.  



You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that disabling cookies may degrade the experience on our site and with our service. To learn more about our usage of cookies, or how you can remove cookies, please [visit our cookie policy page](https://jumpcloud.com/about-our-use-cookies/).

Pixel tags, also known as web beacons or web bugs, are tiny graphic images (referred to here as “ **GI** ”) that are unobtrusively placed on a website or in an e-mail. When the HTML code for the GI points to a site to retrieve the image, it simultaneously passes information to our servers, such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time and duration the GI was viewed, the type of browser that retrieved the image, and previously set cookie values.  

We use GI to help us analyze your online behavior. We may use GI to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring web site addresses.  We also use GI to allow us to send you email in a format you can read and to let us know when you have opened an email message from us.

We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our website and your interaction with our communications, including advertising. If you would like to opt-out of allowing third party companies to collect non-personally identifiable information about you during your visits to our site, please send an email to privacy@jumpcloud.com to update your privacy settings.
