                    while providing students, their family members, and educators with a powerful tool for the recording

                    This policy addresses the online privacy practices of JumpRope and is applicable to all JumpRope
                    services. This policy is effective as of October 15, 2014.</p>

                <h3 class="lightOrange">Privacy Notice</h3>

                <p><strong><em>What information is in JumpRope</em></strong><br>
                    The company JumpRope does not collect personal information from any user, including children;
                    schools and school districts that use JumpRope house in it information that is typically found in a
                    school’s or district’s Student Information System (SIS), such as the student’s name, birthdate,
                    grade level, home address, parent or guardian contact information, etc. A school or district that
                    uses JumpRope as its gradebook will also collect student grades, anecdotal comments about students,
                    attendance-related information, and student-related comments that are associated with grades. The
                    school or district using JumpRope can provide more information on what it is housing in the JumpRope
                    system.</p>

                <p>JumpRope provides district or school administrators with access to JumpRope and the ability to define
                    access levels for other individuals. Only users with administrative access can create new user
                    accounts. Users given access to JumpRope as a staff member or administrator can view student names,
                    biographical information, grades, attendance, and anecdotal data. Students and their family members,
                    when given access to the JumpRope Parent and Student Portal, can view their grades, work that is
                    missing, work that is upcoming, attendance-related data, and their class schedule. JumpRope
                    personnel can access all information, but only do so to support school and district level issues
                    with JumpRope.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Parental consent</em></strong><br>
                    JumpRope has a Parent and Student Portal, and students and their family members can access their
                    grades and other information housed in JumpRope through this portal. Access to the portal is
                    initiated by the school or district, not by JumpRope. JumpRope does not have a parental consent
                    process for the use of the portal by students since JumpRope does not collect personal information
                    from any user.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Non-personally identifiable information</em></strong><br>
                    The JumpRope system may collect certain non-personally identifiable information from visitors to our
                    site, such as the date and time of their visit, the type of browser used (e.g., Internet Explorer,
                    Firefox), the type of operating system used, the ISP from which the visitor receives Internet
                    access, and aggregate information regarding what pages users of the site access or visit.</p>

                <p><strong><em>How do we use the information on JumpRope about children</em></strong><br>
                    JumpRope does not use the information that is hosted on its platform; it is the partner school or
                    school district that uses the information. JumpRope may use non-personally identifiable information
                    such as cookies and Web surfing habits associated with IP addresses to improve the design, content,
                    and performance of our site. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site
                    usage.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Will JumpRope share my child's personal information with third
                    parties?</em></strong><br>
                    The only instance when JumpRope may disclose personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable
                    information is in response to a legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.
                    We also may disclose such information when we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or
                    take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
                    the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
                    In addition, we may transfer personally identifiable information if we are acquired by or merged
                    with another company or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.
