Our primary purpose in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience.

## Our Disclosure of Your Information

As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services.

Advertisers. We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, and financial information are not disclosed to these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit consent.

Educational Institutions. We periodically operate programs to collect and provide to educational institutions personally identifiable information about our members and other visitors to this Site who opt-in to this service. Where we do so, this purpose is described on the page of this Site where that information is collected, this information is only collected from persons who have opted-in to the collection, and we identify the educational institutions to which the information may be provided. We generally have agreements with the educational institutions to which we provide the collected information under which they agree to use it only for the purpose of soliciting new applicants to their institutions and only in compliance with laws applicable to them, and to maintain the confidentiality of this information and disclose it only in accordance with their privacy policies generally applicable to their own applicants, but we cannot control and are not responsible for their actions. For more information about the privacy policies of these educational institutions, please visit their websites.

## Legal Requests

JumboTests cooperates with law enforcement inquires, as well as other third parties, to enforce laws such as intellectual property laws, fraud and other laws, and to help protect you and the JumboTests community from others. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, province, telephone number, email address, UserID history, fraud complaints, and bidding and listing history without a subpoena. However, in an effort to balance your right to privacy and the ability to keep our community functioning properly, we will not disclose additional information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, except when the additional disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss.

Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

## Control of Your Password

You are responsible for all actions take with your User ID and password, including fees incurred by your account. Therefore, we do not recommend that you disclose your JumboTests password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions take with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy before doing so. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password by going to your account page.

Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information

Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted during registration including:

  * Your email address. If you change your email address we keep track of your old email address(es) and your new email address.
  * Your name, city, province, country, gender, interests, work history, education history, your picture, and your password.



You must promptly update your information if it changes. Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public comments made on lessons, discussions, debates or other reviews of course and tutor offerings.

Upon your request, we will deactivate your account and contact information from our active databases. To make this request, please send us an email at support@ JumboTests.com. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based upon your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law.

We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested to remove to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such personal information will be deactivated from public and member viewing and will only be available to select JumboTests personnel.

## Other Information Collectors

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are teachers or students on our Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. Since JumboTests does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
