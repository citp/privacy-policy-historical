# Privacy Policy | Jumptap

Jumptap is committed to ensuring the privacy of the users of mobile services in all of our activities. Our approach to privacy is guided by the following principles:

  * Transparency
  * Care regarding sensitive data
  * User control
  * Consent
  * Data security



Jumptap provides mobile advertising technology and services to our partners (publishers of mobile web sites and wireless carriers), and operates a mobile advertising network. When we serve ads for our partners or on our network, we seek to make the ads more relevant to users’ interests. We and our partners do this by matching the ads to characteristics such as the time of day, carrier network, content of the site, application or page on which the ad is displayed, the type of mobile device and web browser used, anonymous information about the browsing behavior or search queries of the user and other information including data provided by our partners. To assist in tracking a user’s activity, we or our partners may use a mobile browser cookie, a unique but anonymous identifier. When a mobile cookie isn’t available, we may use another unique identifier such as a device identifier.

So while we may select an ad for a user based on the knowledge or inference that that user is a member of a certain demographic group (e.g., a male between the ages of 25 and 34), our system does not need to know who that user is.

We may use masked personal data in order to link additional data to our unique identifier, but we will take measures to ensure users are not identified during this process.

When we have agreements with partners responsible for participating sites, we may tailor the ads users see across our ad network based on user activities at these sites or anonymous information available from these partners. By opting out (via the link below), a user can choose to have us serve ads without reference to the user’s previous browsing behavior or search queries across unrelated sites.

### Transparency

Jumptap explains in clear and easy-to-understand language the ways that it uses information to deliver ads to users.

### Care regarding sensitive data

To begin with, Jumptap seeks to avoid coming into possession of certain sensitive data in the first place. For example, Jumptap’s policy is not to accept possession of “Personally Identifiable Information” (“PII”) about individual users. Our advertising system does not use information that would permit a user to be identified in the “real” world, such as a name, home address, email address, or telephone number. Our partners may gather PII, in which case their privacy policies will govern its use, but when they do, we ask them not to share it with us. Instead, Jumptap assigns to each individual user a unique but anonymous identifier, and uses that identifier to deliver more relevant ads to that user. Likewise, there is certain data that although not personally identifiable we consider sensitive, such as users’ searches or viewing of sites with sexual content or information indicating a users’ specific medical condition. Jumptap does not use these types of sensitive data from one site for tailoring ads at other sites across our network.

Another way we take care regarding sensitive data is to ask user’s permission regarding its use. For example, Jumptap will not use a user’s current GPS geographic location to target an ad unless we or one of our partners have previously obtained permission to do so. Jumptap works with a network of publishers, carriers, and others with mobile websites and with advertisers. Those entities may have certain rights to the data Jumptap collects on their behalf, which they will treat in manners consistent with their own privacy policies. Jumptap may share aggregated data, or non-personal data with third parties.. Naturally, if we are required by law to make a disclosure (e.g., in compliance with a legal process), we will do so. In addition, there may be times where we will need to disclose information to protect our system or our rights or to ensure your safety or the safety of others.

### User Control

To opt out from receiving mobile Web site ads that are targeted based on your activity on the sites of our partners or third party data that we append, click the opt-out link below. This will set an opt-out cookie on your mobile browser, if that browser reliably supports cookies. If you ever delete this cookie from your mobile browser you will need to opt out again in order to reinstate your opt-out status. Note that opting out will not stop advertising but will cause the advertisements to be served without reference to data about that individual user’s activity at the sites of our partners. Information provided to us by the site you are visiting may still be used to tailor an ad for you at that site. For example, if you are visiting a sports site, we may deliver an ad that relates to the context of sports. To opt out, simply click the link below (or enter it directly into your mobile browser). Please note that to opt out successfully you must access this link from the mobile device you wish to opt out. In some cases, such as for ads served onto mobile applications, it will be necessary to provide us with your device identifier in order to opt-out. Clicking the link below will provide you with instructions on how to do so.

In many cases users are providing data directly to our partners. In those cases, the relevant privacy notices will be provided by our partners, and when partners provide us such data, we will follow their policies in addition to our own. We will ask our partners to include information about our activities whenever possible and to point users to the choices we provide.

When we use data in more significant ways, for example when we seek to tailor the ads users see across our ad network based on unrelated Web sites users previously visited or their searches, we will seek to provide greater detail about the use of this data and more options for user control.

### Consent

When we make changes to this policy, we will post the new policy 30 days before it becomes effective. If we make any material changes as to the data we collect or use we (or one of our partners) will get consent from a user before using data previously collected in a manner inconsistent with the previous policy.

We will not target an ad to a user based on sensitive data such as current GPS location unless we or one of our partners first has that user’s consent allowing us to do so. In the event Jumptap is acquired by another entity or otherwise experiences a change of control, the successor entity will have the same rights to use the data subject to this policy as does Jumptap.

### Data Security

Jumptap stores its data in a secure facility that is protected against unauthorized access and controls strictly which of its employees has access to its data.

Jumptap does not deliver ads or content based on individual level data that is more than six (6) months old.
