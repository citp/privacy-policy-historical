1\. This Privacy Policy ("PP") applies for your ("You" or "User") use of the Site, Services (as defined in the Terms of Use available herewith) or any portion thereof and covers how the Company (as defined in the Terms of Use, "We", "Us", or "Our") treats information that it collects and receives about you via the Site, Services or any portion thereof. You are advised that certain information content software and/or services provided through the Services and/or Site are created or provided to the Company by third parties who may provide you with additional information and choices about Your privacy. The use of such information content software and/or services provided through the Services and/or Site created or provided to the Company by third parties is subject to such third parties' privacy policies. 

2\. By using the Services, the Site, or any portion thereof, You agree to accept the terms of this PP. If you do not agree to the terms hereof, please do not use the website. 

### 3\. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information: 

the Company does not collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) except where Users voluntarily provide such information via email or via registration for certain services or newsletters. The Company does collect non-personally identifiable information (“non-PII”) such as Your IP address, domain names, referring website addresses, and some online web browsing activity to deliver more relevant advertising. 

### 4\. Cookies: 

We store a small text file called a cookie on Your computer to track session data and persist Your login for Your convenience. A session cookie expires when you exit Your browser. A persistent cookie stays on Your computer until it is deleted. You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions provided in Your browser's "help" files. 

Some of Our advertisers may use cookies on Our Sites or Services. We have no access or control over such cookies. This PP covers the use of cookies by Us only, and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

### 5\. Data Use: 

The Company uses any non-PII collected to enable us or other third parties such as Our partners to provide you with certain content and/or information such as targeted advertisements that We or they believe may interest you, and to prepare aggregate reports that summarize activity and performance made using Our Site or Services. By the collection of data from Users, we can continually improve Our Services and Site. Non PII may be provided to other parties for advertising, marketing or other uses. 

### 6\. Release of Information: 

In the event that we should go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of Our assets, Your information may be among the assets transferred. 

We may also release Your information if we believe that such release is necessary in order to comply with applicable law, protect the safety and security of Users, protect any of Our legal rights or property, Our employees or affiliated companies or for protection against fraud. 

### 7\. Right to Peruse Information: 

According to the right to peruse information under the Israeli Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981, every individual is entitled, whether by himself or through a proxy authorized in writing or through his/her legal guardian, to peruse information pertaining to him/her that is stored in a database. Having perused such information and having found it to be inaccurate, incomplete, unclear or out of date, such a person may contact the database owner and request to correct, amend or delete the data in question. If the database owner refuses to permit access or comply with a request to amend or delete information, the applicant may appeal to a magistrate’s court as stipulated by applicable regulations. 

Moreover, should the information contained in the database be used for purposes of personally soliciting you, based on Your affiliation to any population group as determined according to one or more attributes of people whose names are included in the database (“solicitation for commercial purposes”), the Protection of Privacy Law, 5741-1981, entitles you to submit a written request that such information pertaining to you be deleted from the database. In such a case, the website management will delete any information required for solicitation for commercial purposes as stated above. Please note that deleting such information might prevent you from continuing to receive services from the website. Any information required by the website management to conduct its business – including documentation of commercial and other activities performed by you on the website – will continue to be legally stored by the website management according to law, but will no longer be used to personally solicit you. If you do not receive notification that the information that the website management was requested to delete has in fact been deleted according to the provisions of this paragraph within 30 days, you will be entitled to apply to a magistrate’s court in the manner specified in the applicable regulations having the force of law, in order for the court to instruct the website management to act as stated. 

### 8\. Sharing with Third Parties

The Company may use third-party tools or services to provide you with certain services or programs. The Company may make third party's information, content, software, services applications and/or tools available for download by you from or through the website or Services. The privacy policies of the third party provider(s) of such applications will apply to Your use of such applications. 

The Company may use third party service providers for the purpose of distributing to Users information, content, software, services and/or toolbar/apps or for providing the Company with operational services or data and server maintenance/optimization services. 

The Company may also share, rent, sell, or disseminate non-PII to third parties and may sometimes use Users' information to enable Our platforms or partners to deliver targeted advertisements that we or they believe will be of interest to you. 

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third parties, and once you leave our Site or services via a link, enable a third party service, or click on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party site.
