        <br>
        <p>
    Hello, hello! We have tried to make our Privacy Policy as detailed as possible so that you know exactly how your
    information will be used. When it comes down to it, though, our policy is a simple one: We pledge to respect your
    privacy as a member of this club. The recipe club is meant to be a home-away-from-home for you while you’re online
    and we intend to be good neighbors!
</p>
<p>
    Our legal friends aren’t fans of simplicity, though, and have asked that we “fancify” our philosophy a bit by adding
    in a few extra words. Please take a moment to read our handiwork below! You can also find additional information on
    the terms of Club membership by reviewing the <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<p> Except as explicitly provided herein, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Just A
    Pinch Recipe Club<sup>®</sup> does not own or control, or to people that Just A Pinch Recipe
    Club<sup>®</sup> does not employ or manage. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time so please check
    back periodically. The current version of this Privacy Policy is dated May 25, 2018. </p>

<p> Any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>. Please
    note that the use of information that we gather is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of use. You
    should check this Site frequently to see recent changes in this Site’s Privacy Policy and its <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. What personal information is collected from me?</h2>
<p>The types of personal information collected on these pages may include, but are not limited to, your name, email
    address, standard contact information including addresses and phone numbers, transactional information, and
    financial information such as credit card number. You also may provide additional information to us when you conduct
    a search on this Site, place an order for merchandise, complete a questionnaire or an entry form for sweepstakes or
    contests, and participate in discussions or other community features. We may also ask you to voluntarily provide us
    with information regarding, for example, your personal or professional interests, demographics, experiences with the
    services we provide and contact preferences. Wherever Just A Pinch Recipe Club
    <sup>®</sup> collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy Policy on that
    page.</p>

<p>Just A Pinch Recipe Club<sup>®</sup> may gather and collect any of the following: (1) IP addresses (the Internet
    address of a computer or device) to track a user’s session while the user remains anonymous, (2) computer or device
    and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform, (3) purchase history,
    (4) the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from this Site, including date and time,
    (5) cookie number, and (6) Web pages and/or products you viewed or searched. Just A Pinch Recipe Club
    <sup>®</sup> analyzes this data for certain trends in statistics, such as which parts of this Site users visit
    and how long they spend there. In general, we do not link your IP addresses to anything personally identifiable to
    you. During some visits Just A Pinch Recipe Club<sup>®</sup> may use software tools such as JavaScript to
    measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, page interaction
    information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</p>

<p>Just A Pinch Recipe Club<sup>®</sup> gathers and stores certain types of information whenever you use this Site
    or the services made available hereon (the “Services”). For example, like many Websites, we use "cookies," and we

    utilities that are designed to allow or help you visit and use Websites anonymously; please note, however, that Just
    A Pinch Recipe Club
    <sup>®</sup> may not be able to provide you with a personalized experience on this Site if you choose to utilize

    you better service, (b) estimate our audience size by determining repeat usage of the Website to help target
    advertisements based on user interests and behavior, (c) track your progress and entries in promotions, sweepstakes
    and contests, if any, and (d) measure certain traffic patterns for use as a research tool to understand how our
    users’ habits are similar or different from one another. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a
    cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. By not accepting cookies, some Web pages of
    this Site may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.
</p>
<p>For logged-in members, performance cookies will be matched to your member account and therefore may be personally
    identifiable. This is required for us to provide logged-in members with all of the custom site features that come
