We ask winners to show us proof of who they are (through their birthdates and Gender) to ensure we are delivering the prize to the right person. We use the mobile numbers provided in order to contact the winner and for prize delivery. Prize preference categories are used in order to ensure we serve the relevant questionnaires to you, giving you optimal enjoyment of our services.

When you complete sponsor questionnaires as part of your prize draw entry, you may voluntarily choose (throughout a questionnaire and at the end of a questionnaire) \- but are not obliged in any way - to provide information about your lifestyle as well as your preferences to participate in sponsor promotions or market research. It is important to note that you will be entered into a prize draw whether or not you choose/ consent to give your information to or consent to be contacted by the sponsor. 

Only if you consent to sharing information with sponsors, may the sponsors use this information to provide you with product or service related offers, and/or only if you consent to hearing from the sponsor can they aggregate the information for the purposes of market research.
