# Justinmind Wireframing tool privacy policy

When you register for a Justinmind account you can be certain that we have implemented comprehensive security practices to ensure that only you and those people you provide authorized access to can see your account. We respect your right to privacy and feel it is important for you to know how we handle the information we receive from you via our Site at www.justinmind.com (the “Site”) and through our online support platform, tools and services offered on the Site (the “Service”).

#### Information you Provide

When you register for our Site or our Service, we ask for information such as your name, company name and address, e-mail address and credit card information. If you sign up for the 30-day free trial account, you are not required to enter your credit card information until you decide to continue with a paid plan. Justinmind uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing.

You can modify your account information at anytime by clicking on the Your account settings link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. Justinmind may use the collected personal information and other information Justinmind collects about your use of our Site and our Service to operate and make the Service available to you, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact you about your use of the Service, research purposes and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and Site and for announcements about products and offers by email.

Justinmind may also transmit or share your personal information with its third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate and maintain our Site and our Service, which may require that your personal information be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Justinmind and the authorized third parties referred to here. Although Justinmind owns the software, code, databases, all rights to the Justinmind application, you retain all rights to your data.

#### Cookies

When you visit our Site or use our Service, we use session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable Justinmind to process your online transactions. Session cookies also help us confirm your identity and are required in order to use the Service. Justinmind uses persistent cookies that only Justinmind can read and use. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service.

#### Information Sharing

Except as described in this policy, Justinmind will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Use](https://www.justinmind.com/terms), or as otherwise required by law. Justinmind may assign or transfer this privacy policy, and your user account and related information and data, to any person or entity that acquires or is merged with Justinmind.

#### Protection of Information

Justinmind maintains reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. These technologies help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

#### Changes to Privacy Policy

Justinmind may update this policy from time to time. You can review the most current version of this privacy policy at any time at http://www.justinmind.com/privacy-policy. Your continued use of the Site or Service constitutes your agreement to be bound by such changes to the privacy policy. Your only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this privacy policy, is to discontinue use of the Site and Service.

#### Changes to Privacy Policy

When you access and use our Site or the Service, you are subject to the Justinmind [Terms of Use](https://www.justinmind.com/terms).
