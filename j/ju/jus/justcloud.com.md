Eligibility, Registration and Account Security

Eligibility and Registration: This section describes the eligibility criteria we require from all of our users. When you register to use our Services, we need to make sure that you are able to legally contract with JustCloud, for example, you are old enough and not in a country, or a person, subject to sanctions which JustCloud is prohibited from contracting with. 

Changes to the Terms and Services 

We always want to deliver the best to our customers and must comply with law. This means that we might, every so often, need to make changes to our Services or this Agreement. Unless the change is required immediately for legal or security reasons, we will provide you with prior notice of the change and, if the change adversely impacts you, you will have a right to terminate the Services following the change.

Your License and Your Use of the Services 

In exchange for the various rights JustCloud grants you under this Agreement, there are certain things we require from you and certain obligations and restrictions we need you to comply with. Most importantly, you need to purchase a service plan for each device you want to back-up using our service and, if you reach the storage limit for your plan, either upgrade your plan or purchase additional storage before you will be able to backup additional data. 

We also need to prohibit certain activities which could affect our other users or which are unlawful. You are required to use the Services in accordance with our  Acceptable Use Policy . 

[ Support ](http://support.justcloud.com/)

We provide 24/7 technical support by email and chat, and 24 hour billing support by phone. You can purchase priority support to ensure your response is prioritised. 

Term and Automatic Renewal 

Our service plans are all for a fixed period of time (e.g. 1 month, 6 months, 12 months or 24 months) unless otherwise expressly provided. To ensure your computer and important files remain backed up, these terms will automatically renew 15 days before the end of your current service plan. This section explains this process in more detail to ensure that your files are backed up by JustCloud for as long as you want them to be! 

Pricing, Billing and Payment 

JustCloud offers a great range of service plans providing Services to suit everyone’s needs and at prices to suit everyone’s pockets. The service charges you pay are based on the service plan you choose, the number of devices you wish to back-up and any additional services you order. All payments are taken, in advance, for the full term of your service plan (e.g., monthly, 6, 12 or 24 months).

Cancellation and Termination 

Even though we do not want you to, we know that one day you might want to leave JustCloud. You can cancel your account at any time by following the process described here and receive a pro-rata refund of fees paid for your remaining service term. After your first 30 days, we are unable to refund fees for additional services where you terminate without cause. If your use of the Services is in breach of key terms of this Agreement or would be detrimental to our servers or networks, JustCloud may terminate your use of the Services without refund. 

Use of your data

This section of the Agreement describes how we store the data you voluntarily choose to back-up with us. Unless we are required by law to retain your data for a longer period, we delete your backup data, or place it in the queue for deletion, within approximately (i) twenty-four (24) hours of you deleting your data through your use of the Services; (ii) in those limited circumstances where JustCloud may have to terminate your account, twenty-four (24) hours of such termination; and (iii) thirty (30) days of you choosing not to renew, or not paying for renewal of, your Services. Once your data has been queued for deletion, it cannot be retrieved by JustCloud.

We also receive information from you when you create an account in order to provide the Services, and from other interactions with you, and more detail on how we use this data is contained in our [ Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/terms#privacy). 

Liability

JustCloud works hard to perform its Services to you and, if we do not or if something goes wrong, you may have a right to monetary remedies from JustCloud.

If a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement is brought for arbitration, it shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration conducted before a single arbitrator, chosen by JustCloud, pursuant to the commercial arbitration rules of the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and shall be administered by the AAA. The arbitration before the AAA shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. The arbitration will be held at the AAA location chosen by JustCloud in Massachusetts. In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, JustCloud will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of arbitration costs shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse JustCloud for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is equal to or greater than the value of your demand, JustCloud shall reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred for the arbitration. 



  15. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction for users in the European Union**

    1. For users in the European Union, this Agreement, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of, or in relation to it, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales subject only to any mandatory provisions of consumer law in the country in which you reside. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods as well as any other similar law, regulation or statute in effect in any other jurisdiction shall not apply. 

    2. You and JustCloud irrevocably agree that the courts of the country in which you reside shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation. 

    3. Alternatively, you may raise the dispute with an alternative dispute resolution body via the [EU Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/). 

  16. **Assignment and Delegation by JustCloud**




JustCloud may, in its sole discretion, transfer or assign all or part of its rights under this Agreement, and may novate or transfer all or any portion of its duties and obligations under this Agreement.

  20. **Severability**




This Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law to any extent, then (i) such provision will be interpreted, construed, or reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable, and consistent with the original intent underlying such provision and (ii) such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement and all such provisions shall remain in full force and effect. 

  21. **No Waiver**




JustCloud reserves its right to take all legal steps available to enforce this Agreement. JustCloud’s failure to exercise any right or remedy hereunder shall not operate as a present or future waiver of such provision or of JustCloud’s rights to enforce such right or remedy in the future.

(If you spot any prohibited content please report this immediately to *** Please enable javascript to email us ***) 

**Fair Usage Policy**

If you have purchased a JustCloud product or service prior to July 2015, then you agreed to comply with the Fair Usage Policy. 

We monitor the usage of our heaviest account users, a dynamic margin is calculated based on averages which, should a user fall into, we may require them to cease backup delete some data to free up some cloud backup space. 

Our dynamic limit is currently 950GB, this figure is calculated every 3 months. We take the average amount of data in Gigabytes queued for backup by our top users. There is a 50GB margin that users can backup into before their backup is actually capped. So the full amount of backup a user could do at the moment is 1TB. Once the total amount of data backed up is under 1TB, the backup will continue automatically until it reaches the 1TB limit again.
