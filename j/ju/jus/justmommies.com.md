# Justmommies Terms of Service

Our message boards are free for all registered users. You may read our boards without registering but in order to post or private message you must be registered. We would like our boards to be a safe place for people to post. We would like to avoid censorship, however, there are times when it will be necessary. Please read our guidelines for what is unacceptable. We reserve the right to remove any posts we believe are against our terms of service.

**Signature Guidelines:  **  
Policy changes for August 2, 2005:   
Justmommies has signature guidelines restricting signatures to 600x600 pixels. The reason this is set is because of load time on our pages. Huge signatures slow down the time pages load quite dramatically. We are requesting that signatures please stay within these guidelines. 

Signature can contain any number of images, tickers, blinkies, etc. however, they must stay within 600 pixels x 600 pixels total size.

Members may include signatures that are political or controversial in nature. We try to allow members the opportunity to express themselves with their signatures; however, signatures must not insult ethnic groups or religous groups. Removal of political signatures is at the discretion of Justmommies administrators.

Memebers may include photos of stillborn babies in their signatures. These signatures are generally used on the pregnancy loss section of our forums but may be used on other forums on the site. If you are not comfortable viewing such photos, please turn off signatures at Justmommies. If you need help with doing this please contact an administrator or send an email to boards@justmommies.com

**Business Signatures:**

All business links must be sponsored links. If you would like to advertise your business and help support Justmommies, you can purchase a signature sponsorship. This is a one time fee. Once you have paid for your siggie sponsorship you can include your business in your signature indefinitely. 

**Text Link Sponsors:** If you would like a text link of your business in your signature there is a $10.00 fee. Text links will be limited to fifty words of text. To pay for your text link please go to our [**signature advertising page**.](http://www.justmommies.com/advertise2.shtml)

**Image Sponsors:** If you would like to have an advertisement in your signature, there is a $20.00 fee. As an Image sponsor you can include a 125x125 pixel advertisement of your site in your signature or you can incorporate your business identity into your own personal signature. If you choose the personal signature option, you must have a signature and not just an ad. Please get approval before you post your new signature. To pay for your image ad please go to our [**signature advertising page**.](http://www.justmommies.com/advertise2.shtml)
