                  <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
                   <p>We provide information to trusted
                      partners who work on the behalf
                      of or with JustLuxe under strict
                      confidentiality agreements. These
                      companies may use your personal
                      information to help JustLuxe
                      communicate with you about offers
                      from JustLuxe and our marketing
                      partners. However, these companies
                      do not have any independent right
                      to share this information. We
                      respond to subpoenas, court orders,
                      and legal process, or to establish
                      or exercise our legal rights
                      to defend against legal claims.
                      We believe it is necessary to
                      share information in order to
                      investigate, prevent, or take
                      action regarding illegal activities,
                      suspected fraud, situations involving
                      potential threats to the physical
                      safety of any person, violations
                      of JustLuxe’s terms and
                      conditions, or as otherwise required
                      by law. If JustLuxe is acquired
                      by or merged with another company,
                      we transfer information about
                      you. In this event, JustLuxe
                      will notify you before information
                      about you is transferred and
                      becomes subject to a different
                      privacy policy.</p>
