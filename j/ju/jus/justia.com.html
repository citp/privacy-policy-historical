		Privacy Policy
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Justia is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all individuals who use our site. Our goal is to provide an Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, from time to time we may collect information during your visits. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you learn more about the personal information we collect, who we might share it with, and how we protect it. 
</p>
<p>
	<i>
		Note: Additional terms and conditions, if any, regarding the collection and use of your information may also be provided to you before you sign up for a particular Justia service - privacy policies for those services will be linked from those particular areas or sections of our site. 
	</i>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		What Information Do We Collect? 
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Justia collects personal information in three ways - through information provided directly from our users, from information collected through web server logs and through cookies. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Information Supplied by Our Users
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Justia collects personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address and telephone number. Justia may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, and legal interests. Justia does not collect any of this unique information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Information from Web Server Logs
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Justia records and saves information about you from our web server logs such as your Internet [Protocol] (IP) address, the time day you visited and your browser type. This information is used to verify our records and to provide better services to you. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Information from Cookies
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	In order to offer and provide you with personalized services, Justia may use "cookies" to store and help track your information. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. Justia will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order. 
</p>
<p>
	<i>
		Note: Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies. You should be aware though that some parts of the Justia Web sites and services may not function properly if you refuse cookies. 
	</i>
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Links to Other Sites 
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Justia encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to visit from Justia so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Justia is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Justia site. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Use or Disclosure of your Personal Information to Third Parties and Co-Brand Partners 
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	Justia will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about you to any third party without first receiving your permission. Justia may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Justia, protect and defend the rights or property of Justia or act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Justia or members of the public. 
</p>
<p>
	Certain Justia services and content may be co-branded with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Justia and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services. In such cases, either a joint privacy statement or a link to the other company's privacy statement will be provided, which will provide you with information about how the other company will use the information and how you can contact the other company with requests to access the information or other inquiries. 
</p>
<p>
	The Justia Lawyer Directory will be sharing all user information with Cornell's Legal Information Institute for their version of the lawyer directory. We may also co-brand the lawyer directory with other third parties, but will not share information marked private or non-public email addresses with those other third parties. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Content Submitted Or Made Available For Inclusion On The Service 
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	With respect to content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Service, this information will be made public on the Internet. "Publicly accessible" areas of the Service are those areas of the Justia network of properties that are intended by Justia to be available to the general public. By way of example, publicly accessible areas of the Service would include the Justia Lawyer Directory, Wikis, Message Boards and Justia developed Websites and Blogs. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Protecting Your Information
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	While Justia is committed to protecting your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords you set up and/or any account information. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>
		Correcting Inaccuracies
	</b>
</p>
<p>
	When you sign up for Justia's products and service, we may send you an e-mail confirming your new account. The message will be sent to the address that you supplied to us at the time of sign-up and will describe ways for you to change or delete the account information provided. Remember to keep the confirmation e-mail as it will also contain information that will help you in case you run into problems accessing our services. 
</p>
<p>
	We welcome your comments or questions. Send us an email to justiaprivacypolicy @ justia.com.
