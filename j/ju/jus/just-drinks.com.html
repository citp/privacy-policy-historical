						<p><strong>Further information on Google Analytics</strong></p>
						<p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about visitor behaviour on our website. Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. This Analytics data is collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site and is not tied to personally identifiable information. We therefore do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.</p>

						<p><strong>Third party cookies</strong></p>

						<p>We also, from time to time, accept adverts hosted by 3rd party organisations; some of these advertising services will result in a 3rd party cookie being set in order to track the viewing statistics. </p>
						<p>Currently we also work with the 3rd party advertising network BBN Networks Inc. The cookies set by this service are outlined here: <a href="http://bbnnetworks.com/content/privacy-policy" target="_blank">http://bbnnetworks.com/content/privacy-policy</a></p>
