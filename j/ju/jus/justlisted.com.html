Web beacons are often invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document or email message. Web beacons are represented as HTML IMG tags in the Web page; users can click on "view profiles" of the Web page to see whether the page is using a Web beacon.</font></td>

Web beacons can also be linked to personal information. For example, advertising networks use Web beacons to add information to a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what banner ads to display based on the profile. Another use of Web beacons is to provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular Web site. Web beacons are also used to gather statistics about Web browser usage at different places on the Internet.</font></td>

						Except as disclosed in this policy, we do not disclose, sell, rent, loan, trade or lease any personal identifying information collected at our site to any other party. We disclose personal information when we have your consent to do so, as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested, for marketing purposes (unless you have chosen not to receive such communications, in certain business transactions), when required by law, or when permitted to protect our rights or property. The following section describes these disclosure circumstances more fully:
						<ul>
							<li>Your Consent.  We will disclose personal information with your consent, which we may obtain in writing, verbally, through online means or as part of a separate agreement. If new services are offered in the future that require disclosure of personal information to third parties or other uses of personal information not covered in this policy, we will update this policy to reflect the changes.<br><br></li>
							<li>Internal Analysis.  We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns, and understand demographic, customer interest, purchasing and other trends among our users. We may outsource these tasks to third parties, provided the use and disclosure of your personal information by these third parties is restricted to performance of these tasks.<br><br></li>
							<li>Transaction Processing – Market Evaluations.  We disclose personal information to third parties as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested or to perform a service on our behalf. When a third party acts solely on our behalf, we will require that party to follow our privacy practices. As stated above, your personal information is forwarded to real estate agents or brokers, and other house-related service providers in order to provide you with the services you request. We only forward your personal information to one real estate agent, broker or other service provider for each type of service you request. If the real estate agent, broker or other service provider is unable to fulfill your request in a reasonable time, we may forward your information to an alternate service provider to ensure that your request is fulfilled. In either case, that real estate agent, broker or service provider may contact you via email, telephone or other means at his or her discretion. We do not regulate how these third parties use your information and are not responsible for removing your information from any third party lists. Please contact any third party service providers directly to be removed from their contact lists.<br><br></li>
							<li>Protection of JustListed.com and Others.  We release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (for example, a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our users' rights, property or safety or to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of our site; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.<br><br></li>
							<li>Business Transfers.  In addition, information about our users, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the company.</li>
