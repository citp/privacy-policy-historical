                                             shall be governed by the AAA Rules.  In such case, you agree to
                                             reimburse JustCloud for all monies previously disbursed by it that
                                             are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  If the
                                             arbitrator grants relief to you that is equal to or greater than the
                                             value of your demand, JustCloud shall reimburse you for your
                                             reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses incurred for the
                                             arbitration.

        Fair Usage Policy      </b>
      <br>      <br>      <br>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          If you have purchased a JustCloud product or service prior to July 2015, then you agreed to comply with the Fair Usage Policy.        </p>

        <p>
          We monitor the usage of our heaviest account users, a dynamic margin is calculated based on averages which, should a user fall into, we may require them to cease backup delete some data to free up some cloud backup space.         </p>
        <p>
          Our dynamic limit is currently 950GB, this figure is calculated every 3 months. 
          We take the average amount of data in Gigabytes queued for backup by our top users. 
          There is a 50GB margin that users can backup into before their backup is actually capped. 
          So the full amount of backup a user could do at the moment is 1TB. 
          Once the total amount of data backed up is under 1TB, the backup will continue automatically 
          until it reaches the 1TB limit again.
