                Personal information we may ask you for and how we might use it
            </h2>
            <p>
                When you visit our website, we collect personal information from you (such as your
                name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.) when you voluntarily provide
                it to us. Depending on the purpose for which the information was provided, we may
                use the information to communicate with you regarding our products, services, and
                promotions, to provide you with other information or materials that you request,
                to customize your interactive experience, and/or to improve our product and service
                offerings.</p>
            <p>
                Here are the circumstances in which we might ask for personal information from our
                consumers though our website, the types of information we obtain, and how we might
                use the information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you contact one of our Customer Service Representatives through our website,
                    we may ask you for personal information such as your name, address, phone number,
                    or e-mail address so that we can respond to your questions or comments. (Of course,
                    if you send us an e-mail, we will at a minimum obtain your e-mail address.)
                </li>
                <li>You may be asked to provide personal information if you:
                    <ul>
                        <li>register as a user of our website or to post content to our website; </li>
                        <li>agree to receive an online newsletter or other information or material from us;</li>
                        <li>register for a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion;</li>
                        <li>register to join a club;</li>
                        <li>participate in a survey, a consumer research panel, or similar type of activity;
                            or</li>
                        <li>ask to receive an online newsletter or other information or material from us; or</li>
                        <li>otherwise participate in features of our website that ask for personal information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you purchase or otherwise request a product, publication, or promotional offering
                    from us or take advantage of a rebate or similar offer, you may be required to provide
                    your contact and/or payment information (such as a credit card number) in order
                    for us to process your request. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Your participation in any of these activities (and therefore your provision of personally
                identifiable information) is entirely voluntary. We may use the information you
                provide to respond to your questions or comments, to administer our promotions and
                websites, to fulfill your request, subscription, or order, to provide you with a
                customized interactive experience, or to otherwise provide or improve our products
                and services.</p>
            <p>
                We will not send you any online newsletter or similar e-mail marketing communication
                unless you opt in or expressly ask to receive such a communication from us. And
                if you do choose to receive any such e-mail communication from us, you will always
                have the opportunity to “unsubscribe” from receiving the e-mail at any time.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">
                When we might provide other parties with your personal information</h2>
            <p>
                If you give us your explicit consent to do so, we may share your personal information
                with other marketers at unaffiliated companies. If you do not affirmatively consent
                to this, we will not share your information with such other marketers.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may provide your personal information to third parties who provide services on
                our behalf. These parties may use the information solely in conjunction with the
                specific services they provide for us (e.g., fulfillment of an order, responding
                to your question or comment, providing a sweepstakes prize, deployment of a consumer
                survey, investigation of a complaint, etc.).</p>
            <p>
                Some of these third parties may be involved in administering or supplementing our
                databases and will need to have access to the information in order to do so. For
                example, we may retain a third party to verify the accuracy of information within
                our databases or to gather additional information about individuals within our databases
                from commercially available sources.</p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event
                that we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party.
                We also reserve the right to share information within General Mills amongst our
                various businesses.</p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to disclose any personal information as needed if such information
                is requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are required to do so by law,
                regulation, subpoena, court order, or by a government entity. We also may disclose
                personal information to third parties if we have reason to believe that disclosing
                such information is necessary to conduct investigations of possible breaches of
                law or legal rights, to cooperate in any legal investigation, or to identify, contact,
                or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the terms of use of our
                website or any other terms applicable to any activity or feature of our website.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">
                Personal information we may receive from third-party social-networking services</h2>
            <p>
                If you choose to access or make use of third-party social-networking services (such
                as Facebook or Twitter), we may receive personal information about you that you
                have made available to those services, including information about your contacts
                on those services. For example, some social-networking services allow you to push
                content from our website to your contacts or to pull information about your contacts
                so you can connect with them on our website. Some social-networking services also
                will facilitate your registration for our website or enhance or personalize your
                experience on our website. Your decision to use a social-networking service will
                always be voluntary. However, you should make sure you are comfortable with the
                information your third-party social-networking services may make available to our
                website by visiting those services’ privacy policies. Any personal information we
                receive through third-party social-networking services may be used as described
                above</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">
                Security for credit card data and transaction information
            </h2>
            <p>
                At General Mills, we are committed to keeping your online transactions safe and
                secure. In order to reasonably assure the privacy and security of your credit card
                and other personal data when making an order, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
                technology. SSL uses encryption technology to create a secure connection between
                your computer and ours. We have also put procedures in place to safeguard the information/data
                we collect from you. We cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any information
                you provide online; you provide it at your own risk.
            </p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">
                Links to other sites</h2>
            <p>
                Our website may contain links to the websites of our subsidiaries and affiliates,
                and to websites that are owned and operated by third parties. These other websites
                may have their own privacy policies and are not be governed by this Privacy Policy.
                We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of websites owned
                and operated by any such third parties. Other websites may collect and treat information
                collected differently, so we encourage you to carefully read and review the privacy
                policy for each website you visit.
            </p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">
                User-generated content and public profile features
            </h2>
            <p>
                This website may, from time to time, contain interactive areas where website users
                might submit comments or other content (including information about the user that
                might be displayed in the user’s public profile within an online community) that
                may be posted on the website or otherwise published. Users who do this should be
                aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g.,
                name, e-mail address, etc.) in content submitted for posting or publication, the
                information can be read and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages
                from other posters or parties. We make no representations and undertake no obligations
                as to the security or use of information you voluntarily include when submitting
                content.</p>

                Send-to-a-friend tools
            </h2>
            <p>
                This website may, from time to time, include a send-to-a-friend application that
                makes it easy for you to forward information or materials from our website to friends
                or family by e-mail. In order to address your e-mail message, the application may
                ask you to input the recipient’s e-mail address and/or similar information (including
                your e-mail address). This information is only used by the application to address
                your message so that it can be properly sent. General Mills does not retain any
                of this information for any purpose.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 20px">
                Children's privacy
            </h2>
            <p>
                This website is not directed to children and we will not request any information
                from children under 13 at this website. General Mills does have other websites that
                are geared in whole or in part to a child audience. Our commitment to the privacy
                of children is described more fully in the privacy policies of those websites. General
                Mills and its affiliated companies take special care to protect the privacy of children
                under the age of 13. We also recommend that parents monitor their children’s Internet
                activities and learn and employ software or other tools which can help their children
                enjoy the fun and entertainment of an on-line experience without compromising their
                personal safety or allowing them to use the Internet in a manner inconsistent with
                their parents’ preferences.</p>

                Changes in our online privacy policy</h2>
