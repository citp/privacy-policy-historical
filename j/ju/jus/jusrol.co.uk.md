# General Mills Online Privacy Policy

General Mills Online Privacy Policy
At General Mills, we are very sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to our
Websites. That is why we are providing you with this Privacy Policy explaining our
online information collection practices and the choices you can make about the
collection and use of your information. We want to be very clear: Unless you
explicitly provide us with your personally identifiable information (e.g. user name, e-
mail address, street address, telephone number, etc.) we do not obtain information
that individually identifies you when you visit our site.
The Information We Collect
At our Websites, we collect information in several ways: through the use of cookie
technology, web beacons, and similar devices, and through information that you
voluntarily provide to us.
How does General Mills use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies?
We employ cookie technology, web beacons, and similar devices on our Websites to
facilitate site administration and navigation and to provide an enhanced online
experience for the visitor. Information tracked includes but is not limited to, (1) a
user's IP address (i.e. princeton.edu - 192.168.1.1), the type of web browser (i.e.
Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer) and operating system (i.e. Windows or
Linux) being used, (2) the pages of the Website a user visits, and (3) other Websites a
user visited before visiting our site.
Cookies do NOT contain any personally identifiable information such as your name or
your e-mail address. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be
configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish
to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies.
Please note that if you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some customized
features on our Websites.
We may use web beacons on our Websites. Web beacons are 1x1 single-pixel graphics
that allow us to count the number of users who have visited a particular web page or
to access certain cookies. We may use web beacons on our Websites to count users
and to recognize users by accessing our cookies. Being able to access our cookies
allows us to personalize our Website and improve your experience at our Website. We
may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail messages that we send to
determine which e-mail messages were opened.
What types of personally identifiable information do we collect?
The types of personally identifiable information we collect on this Website may
include, but are not limited to: your e-mail address, name, street address, age,
gender, other demographic information, and phone number. You may be asked to
provide personally identifiable information, for instance, if you order a product,
register for a sweepstakes, contest or other game, participate in a survey, join a club,
receive a newsletter, or participate in a consumer panel or similar type of activity.
Your participation in these activities (and therefore your provision of personally
identifiable information) is entirely voluntary. Areas of our Website may ask you to
answer general survey questions. Your answers help us to better understand our
consumers generally, and may also help us improve your own experience with our
Website and provide you with more targeted and helpful information.
How Information Is Used By General Mills
We only collect personally identifiable information from you when you choose to
provide it. For instance, If you visit our Website and register for a sweepstakes,
contest, or other game, we collect your e-mail and any other information submitted
for the purpose of notifying you of the results and for any other purpose disclosed and
that you agree to on the information submission page/form. If you opt in or otherwise
give us permission to collect information, we may collect your personally identifiable
information to process your order of goods, to respond to your questions, comments
or complaints, to send out brochures or other company information, or to contact you
in connection with consumer surveys or consumer panels. Only those who opt in or


expressly ask to receive information online will receive it. Anyone who receives such
an e-mail may "opt out" at any time they wish to cease receiving e-mails or other
information from us. There is a check button on the form pages allowing you to ‘opt
in’ to receive information. If this is not checked you will not receive any emails from
us.
We may use the information you provide to improve our Website and to improve our
marketing efforts to consumers.
When General Mills Might Provide Other Parties With Personally-Identifiable
Information
We are committed to keeping your personally identifiable information secure and will
take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse or alteration.
We may share your personally identifiable information with other brands and/or our
affiliates.
We also may share your personally identifiable information with third parties if you
opt in and/or otherwise give us the right to share such information with third parties.
We may also provide your information to third parties who provide services to us.
These parties may only use the information provided in conjunction with the services
they provide for us (e.g. fulfillment of an order, a sweepstakes prize, deployment of a
survey, etc.).
We also reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable information as needed
if such information is requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are required to
do so by law, regulation, subpoena, court order, or by a government entity. We may
also disclose personal information to third parties if we have reason to believe that
disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action
against someone who may be violating the Terms of Use of our Website, to conduct
investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law, to protect the
integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any legal
investigation.
Security For Credit Card, Data And Transaction Information
At General Mills, we are committed to keeping your online transactions safe and
secure. In order to reasonably assure the privacy and security of your credit card and
other personal data when making an order, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
technology. SSL uses encryption technology to create a secure connection between
your computer and ours. We have also put procedures in place to safeguard the
information/data we collect from you. We cannot absolutely guarantee the security
of any information you provide online; you provide it at your own risk.
Links To Other Sites
Please Note: Our Website contains links to the Websites of our subsidiaries and
affiliates, and to Websites that are owned and operated by third parties. These other
Websites may have their own privacy policies and would not be governed by this
General Mills Online Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy practices
or the content of Websites owned and operated by any such third parties. Other
Websites may collect and treat information collected differently, so we encourage
you to carefully read and review the privacy policy for each Website you visit.
Chat Rooms And Message/Bulletin Boards
Users of chat rooms and message/bulletin boards that may be on our Websites should
be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g.,
user name, e-mail address, etc.) on a message/bulletin board, in a chat area, or other
interactive area where personal information can be posted, the information can be
collected and used by other Web surfers (s/b Users). This may result in unsolicited
messages from other posters or parties. We make no representations and undertake
no obligations as to the security of information you voluntarily post in chat rooms and
message/bulletin boards.
