How we collect and use personal information

Just Relevant does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information. We do collect personal information when you apply for partnership or otherwise voluntarily provide such information. Our services, such as the Partner Resource Center, may use cookies and/or sessions to enhance your online experience. Just Relevant may automatically record information, including the IP address, browser type, and the date and time of your request when you visit our website or use our services.

How we use "cookies"

Just Relevant does not use cookies at this time.

What we provide to third parties

While Just Relevant does not provide any third-party access to your personal information, we may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns gathered during millions of customer visits to our Web site each month, but it does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual member unless that member has given us permission to share that information.
