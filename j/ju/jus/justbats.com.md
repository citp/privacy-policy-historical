# Privacy Policy

Personal Information

We may collect and store any identifiable information that you choose to provide in connection with your use of the JustBats.com Sites. This may include personally identifiable information (such as your name, shipping address, billing address, email address, phone number and credit card number) that we need in order to process your orders, communicate with you, or provide you with services that you request. For example, through order forms on the JustBats.com Sites, we collect personally identifiable information necessary for shipping products that you purchase. We also may collect your financial information (like your credit card number and billing address) and your contact information (like your email address, phone number and shipping address). We use state-of-the-art encryption software with every order called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, this software scrambles your information so it is virtually impossible for anyone but JustBats.com to read. Once your information reaches us, our own security system is intended to keep your data stored safely as it is important to us that you feel confident about using and making purchases through the JustBats.com Sites.

_Customer Feedback:_ Some areas of JustBats.com, like the [Testimonials page](http://www.justbats.com/testimonials/), allow users to write their own comments. We also encourage our customers to provide feedback about the JustBats.com Sites by contacting us at [support@justbats.com](mailto:support@JustBats.com). We use all of this information for the sole purpose of improving the experience of all JustBats.com customers, whether it be providing customers with user feedback about our products before purchasing, following up with customers who claimed to have an unsatisfactory experience, or taking advice to heart in order to improve the functionality of the website. We store emails, testimonials, product reviews, and product questions and answers within our database for these purposes. By submitting these Submissions directly through our website, you give us your consent to review and publish them on our pages for others to see. In submitting testimonials, users may choose their own name and location, which allows them to essentially submit testimonials and feedback anonymously.

Use of Personal Information

Financial information that we collect is used to bill you for products that you request. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about JustBats.com to you. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the “How to remove your name from our mailing, sharing or email list” below.  

If you register for email or if you provide your email address to us, we will send you emails.  These emails will inform you of our launch of new products, of special sales, of promotional offers from our partners, and other information related to your use of the JustBats.com Sites.

We use your shipping address to ship your products to you. We use your billing address, if different than your shipping address, to verify your billing information. We never share our customer names or addresses, email addresses or other personally identifiable information, other than to the extent described in the “Disclosures of Your Information” section below.
