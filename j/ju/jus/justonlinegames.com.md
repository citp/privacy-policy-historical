Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. 

Because publisher sites and laws across countries vary, we're unable to suggest specific privacy policy language. However, you may wish to review resources such as the Network Advertising Initiative, or NAI, which suggests the following language for data collection of non-personally identifying information:

\- A statement of the fact that online behavioral advertising ("OBA") and/or multi-site advertising is occurring;  
\- A description of types of data that are collected for OBA and/or multi-site advertising purposes on each of your websites by you and any third parties;  
\- An explanation of how, and for what purpose, that data will be used or transferred to third parties; and  
\- A conspicuous link to the OBA choice mechanism (e.g., opt-out link) provided by the NAI member, and/or a conspicuous link to the opt-out page on the NAI's consumer website.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

If you would like more information about **Opt Out of Behavioral Advertising ("OBA")** or this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies 

You can find additional information in the [NAI Self-Regulatory principles for publishers (PDF).](http://networkadvertising.org/managing/principles.asp) Please note that the NAI may change this sample language at any time.
