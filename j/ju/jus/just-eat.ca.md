## I. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE AND SALE

  


### 1\. INTRODUCTION AND OUR ROLE

1.1. **Company details:** JUST EAT is a company registered in Ontario, Canada with registered company number 002206170, whose registered office is at Main Floor, 379 Adelaide Street West, Toronto, Ontario M5V 1S5. 

1.2. **Service:** We provide a way for you to communicate your orders ( **"Orders"** ) for products ( **"Products"** ) to delivery or takeaway restaurants ( **"Restaurants"** ) displayed on the Website (the **"Service"** ). Please see paragraph 11 for important information regarding the legal relationship between you, JUST EAT and the Restaurants. 

  


### 2\. WEBSITE ACCESS AND TERMS

2.1. **Website access:** You may access some areas of the Website without making an Order or registering your details with us. Most areas of the Website are open to everyone. 

2.2. **Acceptance of terms:** By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms. If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order any Products through the Website. 

2.3. **Revision of terms:** We may revise these Website Terms at any time. You should check the Website regularly to review the current Website Terms, because they are binding on you. You will be subject to the policies and terms and conditions in force at the time that you place an Order through us. 

2.4. **Responsibility:** You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website. You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your Internet connection are aware of these Website Terms and that they comply with them. 

  


### 3\. YOUR STATUS

3.1. **Capacity and age:** By placing an Order through the Website, you warrant that: 

3.1.1. You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and 

3.1.2. You are at least 18 years old. 

  


### 4\. HOW TO MAKE AN ORDER AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED

4.1. **Compiling your Order:** Once you have selected the Products you wish to order from the menu of your chosen Restaurant and provided the other required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your Order by clicking or selecting the "proceed", "place my order" or similar button. It is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you do so we will start processing your Order and errors cannot be corrected. 

4.2. **Amending or cancelling your Order:** Once you have submitted your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled to a refund (please refer to paragraph 4.4 for details of the process relating to rejected Orders). If you wish to change or cancel your Order, you should contact the Restaurant or, if you are unable to reach the Restaurant, our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order. 

4.3. **Payment authorisation:** Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed or communicated to the relevant Restaurant. 

4.4. **Processing your Order and Restaurant rejections:** On receipt of your Order, we will begin processing it by sending it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed. Please note that any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each merely indicate that your Order has been received and is being processed by us, and does not necessarily mean that your Order has been accepted by the Restaurant. We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order. However, Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. 

4.5. **Delivery of your Order:** Estimated times for deliveries and pick-ups are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates. Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or will be available for pick-up within the estimated times. 

  


### 5\. PRICE AND PAYMENT

5.1. **Sales tax, delivery and online payment costs:** Prices will be as quoted on the Website. These prices will have applicable sales taxes applied at checkout, but may exclude delivery costs (if you opt for delivery instead of pick-up) and any online payment administration charges (if you pay for your Order online). These will be added to the total amount due where applicable. 

5.2. **Incorrect pricing:** This Website contains a large number of menus and it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices. If the correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website, we will normally contact you before the relevant Order is dispatched. In such an event, neither we nor the relevant Restaurant is under any obligation to ensure that the Order is provided to you at the incorrect lower price or to compensate you in respect of incorrect pricing. 

5.3. **Payment methods:** Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through the Website or in cash to the Restaurant at the point of delivery to you. 

5.4. **Card payments:** If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of delivery as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card conforms with the receipt data for the Order. Please note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in payments taking up to sixty (60) days to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card. 

5.5. **Credit and discount vouchers:** A credit or discount may apply to your Order if you use a promotional voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by JUST EAT, and you pay for any balance by credit or debit card. Please refer to our Voucher Terms & Conditions for the full terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers. Please note that because of standard banking procedures, your bank or card issuer will initially "ring-fence" the full amount of the Order (before any credit or discount) in your account for a period of typically up to 5 working days (and in some cases up to 30 days, depending on your bank or card issuer), and this amount will therefore be unavailable in your account for that period. The credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer transfers the funds for your Order to us, at which point the credit or discounted amount will not be transferred to us and will instead be released by your bank or card issuer back into your available balance. You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account. 

5.6. **Rejected Orders:** Because of standard banking procedures, once you have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, your bank or card issuer will "ring-fence" the full amount of your Order. If your Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the Order to us, and will instead release the relevant amount back into your available balance. However, this may take a period of typically up to 5 working days (and in some cases up to 30 days, depending on your bank or card issuer). You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account. 

  


### 6\. CUSTOMER CARE

6.1. **General:** If you are having any problems with your Order, we recommend that you try to contact the Restaurant directly in the first instance to discuss the issue. Our experience indicates that this is likely to be the most efficient way of resolving the problem. Notwithstanding the foregoing, customer care is extremely important to us. Accordingly, as described further in this paragraph 6 and subject to paragraphs 6.5 and 11, our Customer Care team will therefore try to assist you where possible (subject to resource availability) if you have any problems contacting or resolving your issue directly with the Restaurant. You can contact our Customer Care team by clicking or selecting the ["Need help?"](http://messenger.providesupport.com/messenger/justeatca.html), "Help" or similar button or by calling the telephone number shown on the Website. 

6.2. **Questions about your Order:** If your Order is taking longer than expected or you have any other problems with your Order that you are unable to resolve directly with the Restaurant, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to follow up on your query. 

6.3. **Changing or cancelling your Order:** If you wish to change or cancel your Order after it has been submitted and payment has been authorised, and you are unable to reach the Restaurant, you may contact our Customer Care team as described above and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order. 

6.4. **Complaints or feedback:** In the event that you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant, please consider providing feedback in the form of ratings, comments and reviews on the Website (together, "Reviews") to reflect your experience. The Reviews are an important part of our quality control process. 

6.5. **Compensation:** If you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant and wish to seek a refund, a proportionate price reduction or any other compensation, you should contact the Restaurant directly to lodge your complaint and, where appropriate, follow the Restaurant’s own complaint procedures. If you are unable to contact the Restaurant, or the Restaurant refuses to deal with your complaint, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above within 48 hours of placing your Order and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to request compensation on your behalf. Please note that we have no control over Restaurants and the quality of the Products or service that they provide, and we are not able to provide, and have no responsibility or liability for providing, any compensation to you on behalf of any Restaurant.
