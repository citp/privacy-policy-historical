**Customer Service**

From time to time, we may share your personally identifiable information in connection with strategic relationships, such as those involved in the operation of a co-branded website or web pages with a strategic partner on our Site. You should be aware that these co-branded sites may collect different or additional information. Additionally, we may provide links on our site to other websites not controlled by us. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to these third-party websites. Please consult the privacy policy of the website you are visiting.

Occasionally we may provide our postal mailing list (not email) to other companies whose products we believe may be of interest to you, based on your usage of our Site and other personally identifiable information available from our records and other sources.

We may transfer personally identifiable information in connection with a proposed or actual merger or sale (including transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control.

We aggregate non-personally identifiable information to improve the Site and for business and administrative purposes. We may also use or share with third parties for any purpose aggregated data that contains no personally identifiable information.

Other than the forgoing, we only release our Users’ personal information when, at our sole discretion, we believe it is necessary to comply with the law (such as a subpoena, court order, administrative or governmental order), to apply or enforce our Terms of Use and other agreements, to protect our rights and the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud and to reduce credit risk. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**Use of Cookies**

When you log into your account at JustOneEye.com, we send one or more cookies—a small file containing a string of characters—to your computer. Cookies uniquely identify your IP address and browser type, as well as, over time, your browsing and shopping preferences. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as how people search on our site.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some JustOneEye features and services, including adding items to your shopping bag or checking out, will not function properly if your cookies are disabled.

JustOneEye processes information collected by cookies in a collective and anonymous way, to optimize services to Users of the Site.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.

We protect the security of any information you submit to Just One Eye with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. This allows for the secure transmission of information between your computer or other device and our servers. Only those JOE employees and third parties who need access to your information to perform their duties are allowed such access.

When processing your order, your credit/debit card information is transmitted to the appropriate company. However, when we confirm an order with you, we include only the last four digits of your credit/debit card number.
