Regardless of any other provision of this Privacy Policy, we may permanently store any personal information provided by you via such registration process.

  * **For contests conducted on the Website** , we use the personal information you provide only for the purpose of contacting you if you win a prize and sending the prize to you.

Accordingly, we will ask each contestant to provide year of birth, as well as name, address, and email address. Please refer to the specific age requirements for each contest as rules may vary from contest to contest.
