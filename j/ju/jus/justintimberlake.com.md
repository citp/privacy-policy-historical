We collect these e-mail addresses directly, in response to Children’s requests to receive e-mail updates or other information regarding a particular recording artist or group of artists. When we collect these e-mail addresses, we also request the e-mail address of one parent or guardian ("Parent").

How We Use the Personal Information. We use the Children’s e-mail addresses to send them updates about the artist(s) they’ve requested and other artists and music, and for no other purpose. We use the Parents’ e-mail addresses to inform them of their Children’s requests, our resulting contact with their Children, and other information regarding their rights and our collection and use of their Children’s personal information.

  
Third Parties. We work with third parties that provide services, which may include website hosting, e-commerce affiliation, data analysis, e-mailing and other services of an administrative nature. Personal information may be shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services. We seek to impose confidentiality obligations on such service providers. We do not otherwise knowingly disclose Children’s personal information to third parties.

  
GetMusic and DotClick. Please note that we operate the Children’s Sites in conjunction with an unaffiliated entity, GetMusic LLC ("GetMusic"). We also provide a link to media player plug-in software on some of the Children’s Sites to websites owned or controlled by DotClick Corporation ("DotClick"). Neither GetMusic nor DotClick collects information or data from visitors to the Children’s Sites, however, there is a link on the Children’s Sites to websites owned and/or controlled by GetMusic and DotClick, on which websites visitors may voluntarily provide personal information to GetMusic and/or DotClick. We are not responsible for GetMusic’s or DotClick’s collection or use of information or data, but rather such collection and use is subject to GetMusic’s and DotClick’s privacy practices. You should review the privacy policies of GetMusic and DotClick to understand how they collect and use information.  


Conditioning Participation on Unnecessary Disclosure. Participation in all activities offered through the Children Sites is voluntary. We may not condition a Child’s participation in any activity offered on the Children Sites on the Child’s disclosing more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.

  
Parental Review. To review the personal information that we have collected from a particular Child, such Child’s Parent may send a request by e-mail to [privacycoordinator@zomba.com](mailto:privacycoordinator@zomba.com). This request must contain the Child’s e-mail address so we can provide the requesting Parent with the proper information. Because we must ensure that such requests are from the applicable Child’s Parent, they must be sent from the Parent’s e-mail address initially provided by such Child. If this is impossible because the Parent’s e-mail address is inoperable, or for any other reason, such Parent may mail a signed request, including such Parent’s telephone number, to Zomba Recording Corporation’s address as provided below. Through the same process, Parents may: (i) request that we delete their Children’s personal information and make no further use of it; and (ii) update your child’s personally identifiable information.
