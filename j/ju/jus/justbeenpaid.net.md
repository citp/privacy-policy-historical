**OUR COOKIE POLICY**

4.1. When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies.

**These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:**

·          enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task

·          recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested

·          measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast

4.2 The majority of browsers will allow you to alter the settings used for cookies and to disable and enable them as you require.  If you do not want cookies then please refer to the “Help” menu on your browser for instructions on disabling them.  You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through "[Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them](http://www.direct.gov.uk/managingcookies)"

**4.3. Our use of cookies**

This cookie expires when a user pauses on a page on the site for longer than 30 minutes. This cookie expires 30 minutes from set/update.
