### 3\. Legal basis for processing personal information

Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information as described above will depend on the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where (i) we have your consent to do so, (ii) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or (iii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights. In some cases, we may have another legal basis such as a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (and we’ll also explain the possible consequences of you not providing it).

Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make it clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about, or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.




### 4\. International data transfers 

We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which you are resident. Just Eat’s website servers are mainly located in Ireland and the United Kingdom, however our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate in a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, the Philippines, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and United Kingdom. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries. 

Whilst these countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country, you can rest assured that Just Eat takes care to implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information in those countries in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Some of the safeguards we rely on include, where appropriate, using the European Commission’s approved standard contractual clauses with our suppliers, intra-group transfer agreements (so that we can safely transfer your data between the Just Eat group of companies all over the world) and contracting with Privacy Shield certified companies in the United States, where this is appropriate. 

### 5\. Security 

We place great importance on keeping your personal information safe and secure. As such, we put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures / industry standard technology to protect it from unauthorised access and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. 

The security measures we use are designed to provide a level of protection and security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Where you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We advise you not to share your password with anyone and to use a unique password for our Services. We will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password. 

### 6\. Data retention 

Just Eat will retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, while you hold an account with us or to enable us to meet our legal, tax or accounting obligations). 

If you object to us processing certain categories of your personal information (including in relation to receiving marketing communications from us), we will retain a record of your objection to the processing of your information so that we can continue to respect your wishes. 

We will destroy or permanently anonymise your personal information at the point that we no longer need to process it for our ongoing legitimate business needs or for any legal reason. If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 

### 7\. Your data protection rights 

Just Eat respects your privacy and data protection rights. Below is a summary of your rights in respect of your personal information which Just Eat handles:

  * Just Eat provides you with the tools to access, review or update your personal information at any time through your account. If you wish to request deletion of your personal information, you can do so by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
  * You can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request that it be ported to a third party. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.
  * You have the right to opt out of receiving marketing communications that we or our website data provider, Investis, send you at any time. You can exercise this right by using the unsubscribe functionality in the communication you receive.

  * Similarly, if we collect and process your personal information on the basis of your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
  * You have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about our collection and use of your personal information.



We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
