# JustGiving’s privacy policy - JustGiving

Your privacy is paramount. This is how serious we are about it: we will never pass on, trade, exchange or sell your personal details to **anyone** without your express consent. We really mean _anyone_ : not a sister company, not a ‘friendly third party’, not even the charity you are giving to.

There is one exception to that rule: when you build a JustGiving page or donate by text message (but for text messages only where you have completed gift aid form and agreed the we can pass details on), we will pass on your name, email address and postal address to the charity you have chosen to support, so that they can thank you. You can opt in to receive further communications from them if you like, but you don’t have to. We will not pass your details onto a non member charity until they have entered into an agreement with us.

**That’s it. If you want the full, extended version, here it is:**

By visiting or registering with Justgiving.com, you are agreeing to the practices detailed in the Privacy Policy below so please read on to find out how information relating to you will be treated as you use our site.

  1. **The information we collect from you as a site visitor**  
JustGiving (JG) collects information about the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of all visitors to our site. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer automatically when you use the internet. This information is only collected in aggregate (in other words, we are not able to monitor your individual usage of the site) and helps us monitor site traffic patterns in order to improve our service. 

This site uses cookies for some interactive features. A cookie is a small amount of data, which includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers will automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser to reject cookies but some parts of the web site may not function properly if the cookies are rejected. 

  2. **The information we collect from you as a registered user with a JustGiving page**  
When you create a secure personal account on JG for the purpose of creating a JustGiving page, we collect your title, name, email address, postal address, your phone number (where you agree to provide it) and your password. We will automatically pass on your name and email and home addresses to the member charity that will benefit from the donations you are collecting. We will not pass on your details to a non member charity unless they have entered into an agreement with us. In all other instances, we will not pass on this information to any third party unless you give us your express consent. 
  3. **The information we collect from you when you donate**  
When you make a donation on JustGiving, we collect: your first and last name; your email address; your declaration of tax status; your credit or debit card details (including card type, card number and expiry date); and your billing address. 
    * **Your name.**  
If you do not want your name to be publicly associated with your donation, please enter your name as "Anonymous" when filling out the donation. Your name then will not appear on the fundraiser’s JustGiving page, nor will it appear in any online search results. Your name will always be passed on to the fundraiser but, if you have made an anonymous donation, your name will only appear in their secure account area.
    * **Your email address.**  
We need your email address so we can confirm your donation or let you know if there’s been a problem. However, we never share your email address with any other party unless you explicitly say so. If you’d like, we can pass your email address on to your fundraiser friend and/or to the member charity you’re donating to so they can thank you and keep you updated. We will not do this unless you expressly ask us to do so. If your donation is to a non member charity, we will not pass your email address to them unless they have accepted your donation and entered into an agreement with us. That’s it.
    * **Payment details.**  
We will only use your payment details for the purpose of processing your donation via our card processing partner Barclaycard. To find out more about the security of your payments, please read our [Security policy](https://web.archive.org/info/security). If you make a Gift Aid declaration, we will pass it on to HM Revenue and Customs for the purpose of reclaiming tax on behalf of the recipient charity. Your Gift Aid declaration includes your name and home address (which may be different from your billing address) along with the confirmation that you are paying sufficient amounts of tax in the current tax year. All of this information is held securely and will never be passed on or sold to anyone else. Ever.
  4. **The information we collect from you when you donate by text message**

When you make a donation by text message, we collect: your first and last name; your mobile telephone number; the name of the charity you want to donate to; and the amount of your donation. We may ask you to provide your email address.

If you donate by text message we will reply to your message and give you the choice to add gift aid to your donation. If you choose to add gift aid to your donation we will collect your home address and postcode so that we can process your gift aid supplement. When you donate by text we will look after your information as carefully as we do when you donate on the website.

  5. **The information we collect from you when you use Fundraising Coach**

When you use the Fundraising Coach application (" **FC** ") you will access your social media accounts and other communication tools, such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, Twitter and Facebook (" **Your Accounts** ") through FC. When we access Your Accounts as part of the FC service we will collect the names and electronic addresses of the people in your contacts lists.

    * **FC contact lists**  
When we collect the names and electronic addresses of your contacts we will ask you to sort them into two contact lists - one for "fans" (eg family and close friends) and one for "Supporters" (eg colleagues and other relatives). When the contacts are sorted into the different contact lists FC will help you to generate and send emails requesting donations. There will be two versions of the email which will be slightly different depending on which contact list the contact is in. We will record the contact lists so that the right messages are sent to your contacts.
    * **Your contacts**  
When we collect the details of your contacts from Your Accounts, we will give you the choice of which contacts you want to include in your fundraising campaign. You can choose individual contacts to add to your FC contact lists or you can select all contacts. Any contact who you choose not to include in your FC contact lists will not be sent any emails through FC and we will not keep a record of or use their details for any other purpose. At any point during your fundraising campaign you can choose to remove a contact from the campaign and they will receive no further messages through FC. To do this just log in to your own JustGiving page, access FC and de-select the individual from your FC contact lists. We will only use the information we collect relating to your contacts for the purposes of running your fundraising campaign through FC.
    * **At the end of your campaign**  
When your fundraising campaign is finished we will keep a record of your FC contact lists. By accepting the Privacy Policy you agree to us keeping a record of your FC contact lists for up to six months. At any time you will be able to remove individual contacts or delete the whole contact lists for yourself in the same way that you can at any point during the campaign. We will automatically delete your FC contact lists after six months. This will not affect the address books you already have in your standard JG account. 

When you provide your contacts' electronic addresses by using FC, we guarantee that we will only use them for the purposes of running your fundraising campaign through FC. We will not use their electronic addresses for any other purpose and will not provide them to anyone else. We will keep your contact details secure and confidential. Your contacts will not be sent any electronic communication from a JG address unless they donate and opt in to receive regular information from us or otherwise consent to us contacting them.

By using FC you consent to us collecting the details of contacts from Your Accounts and you authorise us to use this information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy and on the Website. You agree that all communications sent to your contacts through FC are your sole responsibility. In relation to FC, we will at all times act as a data processor on your behalf. You acknowledge that you will remain the data controller of your contacts' data.

  6. **Email alerts and newsletters from JustGiving**  
We may send you short emails from time to time: email alerts with important information about our service and newsletters with tips, stories and competitions. You will always be offered the ability to unsubscribe from our newsletters and from our fundraising tips, donation alerts and fundraising updates. If you have a personal JG account, you can change your contact preferences at any time by visiting the ‘Your details’ and ‘Change your email preferences’ sections.
  7. **Charities’ use of your personal information**  
Where you have opted in to pass on your personal details to a charity through our website or via text donation, JG declines all responsibility for the subsequent use of your personal information by the charity. If you wish to stop receiving further communications from a charity, please contact them directly. 
  8. **Security precautions to protect your information**  
The transfer of online transaction data to and from the web site is protected by the implementation of a Secure Sockets Layer protocol. Our VeriSign 128-bit secure certificate allows web browsers to verify the authenticity of our secure.justgiving.com domain and to communicate with our site securely, protecting confidential information from interception and hacking. It is your responsibility to keep your password secure at all times to avoid unauthorised use of your JG account.
  9. **Tell a friend**  
When you provide a friend’s email address for JG to forward a web address, we guarantee that we will only use your friend’s address for this purpose. We will not send them further emails unless they opt in to receive regular information from us.
  10. **Legal process**  
Although unlikely, JG may be forced by law to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate authorities.
  11. **Acceptance of our Privacy Policy**  
Use of the JG website and associated services implies acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you are not satisfied with any aspect of it please do not continue to use the website and services. This policy may change from time to time and you are deemed to have accepted the current version each time you use Justgiving.com or any site powered by us.
