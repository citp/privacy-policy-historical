		<h1>Privacy Policy And Consumer Education</h1>
			<div class="entry">
				<p>It is Buzznet’s policy to respect the privacy of Members. We provide this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit and use our website located at www.justjaredjr.com (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site, and when you access, download, purchase or use any information, services, products or content appearing on the Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
<p>
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose to any member’s name or contact information or Personal Information (defined below). Buzznet will also not monitor, edit, or disclose member’s information unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) cooperate with law enforcement authorities or comply with legal process served on Buzznet; (2) to protect the property and rights of Buzznet or a third party; or (3) to protect the safety of the public or any person; (4) to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable; or (5) fix or debug problems with the Buzznet servers, software or service.</p>
<p>Children’s Privacy</p>
<p>
The Site is not directed to children under 13 years of age, and Buzznet requires users of its service to be 13 years of age or older. Accordingly, Buzznet does not knowingly collect or maintain on its Site personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@buzznet.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>
<p>
We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask a parent or guardian for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>
<p>
<strong>THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>
When you post or register to become a member of the Site and in the course of using the Site, you may voluntarily submit personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your account (“Personal Information”). Personal information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number and e-mail address. Buzznet may also collect Personal Information from you if you choose to opt-in to participate in sweepstakes, surveys, contests or competitions. When you register with the Site, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, e-mail and photo, are displayed to people you have specified in your privacy settings. Profile information you submit to Buzznet, and make public via your privacy settings, will also be available to other Buzznet users via searching our Site, and may be available to third party search engines. This is primarily so your friends can find you and the content you create and store on Buzznet. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others to identify you.</p>
<p>
As you use the Site, our servers automatically record information that the browser sends whenever it points to a Site or online service (“Log Data”). Log Data may include, but is not limited to, your computer’s Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to one of the Site and information you search for on a Site.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Personal Information is used for the following purposes: (i) to provide and improve our services, features and content; (ii) to administer your use of our services and Buzznet account; (iii) to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site; (iv) to better understand your needs and interests; (v) to fulfill requests you may make; (vi) to personalize your experience; (vii) to provide service announcements; and (viii) to provide you with further information and offers from us or third parties that we believe you may find useful or interesting, including newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information on Buzznet related services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. Further, you may easily adjust your privacy and e-mail settings via your account settings at any time.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER INFORMATION/LOGGING AND COOKIES</strong></p>
<p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use “persistent cookies” to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site. We use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of our service, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Site. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the services.</p>
<p>
Buzznet also uses the services of a third party vendor, Omniture, to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use the Site. Although Omniture logs the information coming from our Site on our behalf, Buzznet controls how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to assist Buzznet in improving our Site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can “opt-out” of Omnitures web-Site analysis tool by clicking here: http://buzznet.122.2O7.net/optout.html</p>
<p><strong>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</strong></p>
<p>We may share Personal Information with third parties for purposes of administering sweepstakes and contests.</p>
<p>Buzznet Members. In addition to your username, any comments or submissions that you post to the Site will be publicly available. You post and share your Personal Information and content on the Site at your own risk. While we go to great lengths to create a safe and enjoyable experience on the Site, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your content and/or profile information. In addition, we cannot anticipate other users’ ability to circumvent privacy settings. You understand that, even after removal of your Personal Information and content from the Site, copies of your information may remain viewable in cached or archived Web pages or on the local computers of users who may have downloaded or stored your information.</p>
<p>Even with all the appropriate precautions Buzznet takes to protect your information, we recommend you refrain from sending private information or Personal Information by e-mail, chat, or other messaging services.</p>
<p>
Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.</p>
<p>Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the our services, to provide the services on our behalf, to perform services related to administration of the Site (including, without limitation, maintenance, hosting and database management services, web analytics and administration). These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>
Business Transfers. Buzznet may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
Invite-A-Friend<br>
If you choose to invite your friends to use Buzznet, using our invitation options, we will ask for information such as an e-mail address. We will automatically send your friend(s) a one-time e-mail invitation to visit the Site. Buzznet stores this information to send this one-time invitation, and to track the success of this referral feature.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGING OR DELETING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>All Buzznet members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile by logging into their account and changing the “user preferences” associated with their account. If you completely delete all such information, your account may be deactivated. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>
Buzznet is concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ a variety of industry-standard measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>
<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</strong></p>
<p>
Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to Buzznet, please be advised that we transfer Personal Information to the United States and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
<p><strong>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong></p>
<p>
The Site contains links to other websites. If you choose to visit an advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
<p><strong>CONTACTING BUZZNET</strong></p>
<p>
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at contact@buzznet.com. You may also contact us by mail at Buzznet.com, 6464 W. Sunset Blvd., #650, Hollywood, California 90028.</p>
