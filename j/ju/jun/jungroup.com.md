Jun Group Productions LLC Terms of Use

### Jun Group Productions, LLC

Posted October 1, 2016   
Effective October 1, 2016

### Introduction

At Jun Group Productions, LLC and our HyprMX Mobile LLC subsidiary, we connect advertisers and publishers that we call clients to an audience of end users that we call consumers. Consumers are end users of applications and websites that we call properties, and those properties are owned by third parties that we call partners. Our services enable clients to deliver targeted, interactive content that we call engagements to consumers, and in doing so, we collect information about consumers and partners. We also collect information from visitors to our websites, www.jungroup.com and www.hyprmx.com. 

This privacy policy describes how we collect, retain, use and disclose information that you make available to us as a user of our services, including as a visitor to our websites, as a consumer end user of our partners' properties, and/or as one of our partners. Information includes personal information that identifies a specific person, such as a full name or email address, and non-personal information, such as your interests, service usage and Internet access device characteristics. Whether or not you have registered with or subscribed for our services, by using our websites or services, you agree to this privacy policy. 

###  Information Collection 

We and our service providers collect the following information from and about you:

1\. Registration and survey information, consisting of information you submit through our services, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, answer survey questions or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration information may include, for example, name, picture, email address, gender, zip code and birthday.

2\. Public information and posts, consisting of comments or content that you post through our services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, email address, status, profile information and picture. Public information and posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines. 

3\. Information from social media, consisting of the information made available to us if you access or log-in to our services through a social media service or connect our services to a social media service. This information may include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access our services through social media services or when you connect our services to social media services, you authorize us to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this privacy policy.

4\. Activity and device information, consisting of data we may collect when you access our services. For example, we collect information about your computer or other Internet access device, your operating system and browser or other Internet enabled application, your IP address and information about what ads you have viewed and interacted with. If you access our services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device (e.g. Apple's IDFA or Google's GAID), geolocation data, wireless service provider and other transactional information for that device. 

5\. Information from other sources. We may supplement the information we collect with information from other sources, such as publicly available information from social media services, commercially available sources and information from our affiliates or business partners.

###  Information Use and Disclosure 

We may use and disclose non-personal information about you for any purpose, including purposes that may exceed the purposes listed below. We may use and disclose non-personal and personal information about you as follows:

1\. To deliver our services to you and others, to measure, manage, support and improve our services, and to allow service providers to assist us in performing our services. We may make your information available to certain third-party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide our services. For example, we use services from Amazon and Google to support our technology infrastructure, and third parties also facilitate social content sharing, ad creation, ad serving, ad campaign measurement and service usage tracking. 

2\. To allow social sharing functionality. If you log in with or connect a social media service account with our services, we may share your user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with others, including other service users and your friends associated with your social media service. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider. By logging in with or connecting your services account with us to a social media service, you authorize us to share information we collect from and about you with others, and the social media service's use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service's privacy policy. If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, do not connect your social media service account with our services and do not participate in social sharing on our services. 

3\. To deliver relevant ads and conduct research. We use the information we collect from and about you to deliver relevant ads to you when you use our services or another service. For example, our services are embedded in our partners' properties, and we deliver our clients' ads to you when you access those properties. We also use your information to conduct research e.g. about consumer trends, sentiments or the effectiveness of advertising. Except as described above in connection with social sharing, we will not use the personal information we collect from you to deliver relevant ads to you or to conduct research without your opt-in consent. As noted above, we may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties, and those other sources may assist us in delivering relevant ads to you based on personal information about you that they can access, even if they do not provide your personal information to us in doing so. For example, a retailer may transfer your purchase history and phone number to a third party that may combine that information with other information, enabling an advertiser to instruct us to deliver relevant ads to your device by targeting your device identifier. 

4\. To contact you. We may send you promotional materials or notifications related to our services. If you want to stop receiving them, follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email. There are certain service notification emails that you may not opt-out of, such as notifications of changes to our services or policies. If you have installed a mobile app and you wish to stop receiving push notifications, change the settings either in your mobile device notification setting or through the app.

5\. To share with our affiliates. We may share your information with our affiliates for the purposes described in this privacy policy. Our affiliates consist of Jun Group Productions, LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary HyprMX Mobile LLC. You should refer to the separate privacy policies of each of our affiliates, as they may differ.

6\. To share with business partners. We may share your information with business partners (e.g. clients) for their own business purposes, including to advertise to you and to send you marketing communications. If you are a California resident, you have the right to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.

7\. To protect our rights and those of others. We may disclose your information if we have a good faith belief it is necessary in order to: (i) investigate, protect, enforce, or defend our legal rights, privacy, safety, or property and that of others (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of our services users or the public; (iii) protect against fraud or manage risk; (iv) comply with the law or participate in any legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.

8\. To complete a merger or sale of assets. If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of our business, we may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction, and they will not necessarily be bound by this privacy policy following any such transaction. 

9\. In any other manner that you authorize us with your informed, affirmative consent.

###  Cookies 

We refer to browser cookies and other tracking technologies such as pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash cookies as cookies. Cookies are small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier. When you access websites, apps and other services, they may store cookies on your device and use them to recognize you when you make subsequent requests for services from the original service provider or another service provider. We use cookies to collect and store information about your use of our services, including website pages you have visited, partner properties you have accessed, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and ads you have seen. Our services providers and the other third parties that we engage with or link to may also use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information. In many cases we do not control the use of information by these third parties, and your use of or exposure to their services is governed by their separate privacy policies. If you wish to know more about cookies, you can visit the [ Network Advertising Initiative.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. By blocking cookies, you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through our services. We do not respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals. 

###  Interest-Based Advertising 

Interest-based advertising refers to using information collected across non-affiliated, third-party sites and applications over time to provide more relevant advertising to you, based on your interests inferred from that information. The Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) is a coalition of digital advertising companies that has created a self-regulatory code for interest based advertising, and we comply with those [self-regulatory principles. ](http://www.aboutads.info/principles)

Consumers may opt out of receiving interests-based ads in our services by following these instructions: 

1\. For iOS devices running iOS 8 or higher, go to Settings > Select Privacy > Select Advertising > Enable the "Limit Ad Tracking" setting. Our services do not support earlier versions of iOS. 

2\. For Android devices with OS 2.2 or higher and Google Play Services version 4.0 and higher, go to Google Settings App > Ads > Enable "Opt out of interest-based advertising." 

For iOS users, additional instructions are available on [ Apple's support site](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074). If you opt out, you will still see ads and they will not be based on your interests as ascertained from third-party information. Instead, they may be untargeted, target based on first-party information, or related to the content of the property you are using.

###  Health and Other Sensitive Information 

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (such as social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through our services unless we specifically request it from you and you opt in to providing such disclosure. 

We may deliver ads to consumers about non-sensitive health topics based on first- and third-party data. We may deliver ads to consumers about sensitive health topics either based on the context of the property on which the ad is being served or with a consumer's opt-in permission. We use custom rather than standard segments for delivering health-related ads, for example "asthma suffers" and "migraine suffers." If we survey consumers about health topics, we may use their responses to deliver relevant ads them and/or to allow third parties to provide relevant ads to them. If we survey consumers about sensitive health topics, we will ask them provide us with their affirmative consent to use their responses in this manner.

We do not use or allow others to use sensitive information to determine eligibility for health insurance, health care treatment eligibility, life insurance, or employment.

###  Children's Privacy 

Our services are for a general audience, are not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect "personal information" as defined in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, from children less than 13 years of age other than unique identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers). Some partner properties may be targeted to children, and in any case we collect unique identifiers from children younger than 13 or properties targeted to children only to support our internal operations. Our partners and clients are responsible for their own compliance with COPPA. If you believe your child has provided us with information covered by COPPA, please contact us at the address below and we will use reasonable efforts to delete the applicable information from our records.

###  Security

No method of online information storage or transmission is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee information security.

In your request, please include your email address, name, address, and telephone number and specify clearly what information you would like to access, change, update, or suppress. We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Your choices regarding our use and disclosure of your personal information for marketing purposes are as follows:

We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others, and there may be a delay in the removal of the content from elsewhere on the Internet and from search engines. Unless we otherwise agree in writing, we may retain your non-personal information, including information regarding your property's consumers, in accordance with our data retention policy below. 

###  Location of Data

Accordingly, you consent to having any personal information processed in the United States. United States and other data protection and other relevant laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. This includes laws regarding the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described above.

###  Third Parties and Linked Services 

Our services may link to or be integrated with properties operated by third parties, and may carry ads or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by such unaffiliated companies. For example, our services for partners include an "advertisement mediation" service that allows ads from our clients to be served to consumers alongside ads from third party ad networks in our partners' properties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, and once you leave our services or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service. To determine which ad networks are serving ads via our mediation service, please contact our partner who owns or operates the applicable property (i.e. contact the mobile application developer directly). 

###  Data Retention 

We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law. Even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable, for example, if you have shared information with social media or other services. We may also retain backup information on our servers for fraud detection, to enforce our legal rights, or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies. It is not always possible to remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements. 

###  Privacy Policy Updates 

We may modify this privacy policy by posting an updated copy on our website. Please look at the effective date at the top of this privacy policy to see when we last revised it. Any changes to this privacy policy will become effective when we post the revised privacy policy on our services, provided that if we make material changes to this privacy policy, the revised privacy policy will not become effective until 15 days after we post it to our services. We will also notify our service users for whom we have contact email addresses of any such material changes.
