## Definitions

The term "personally identifiable information" (PII) means any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as a name, address, telephone number or e-mail address.

The term "aggregate information" means information that does not allow us to identify or contact a specific individual but describes a general category of information about visitors to the Site, such as demographics, purchase categories (e.g., wedding dresses), or visitors using a particular browser to access the site.

The term "cookies" means small data files placed on your computer by a Web site so that the site can personalize the site and track personal site usage.

We will provide only that information when responding to those requests. Of course, we will comply with any legal requests for release of information. _Please note that Junebug Weddings has never sold any of our PII, but we do reserve the right to sell this information to third parties on a highly limited basis._
