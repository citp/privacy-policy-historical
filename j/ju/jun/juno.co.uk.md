**Our policy**  
Juno Records takes the privacy of its customers very seriously, and will only collect information in order to fulfill customer orders, provide information via our e-mail new release lists or seek your feedback regarding our services.  We do not sell or share mailing lists or customer information with any other companies or individuals. 

**Information collected**  
To process an order, we require your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit card number and expiry date. To receive our new release information e-mails, we require only your e-mail address. 

**Cookies**  
As you browse www.juno.co.uk, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partner, AdRoll, then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with www.juno.co.uk. The techniques our partners employ do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number. You can visit [this page](http://www.adroll.com/about/privacy) to opt out of AdRoll and their partners' targeted advertising. 

 **Security**  
The shopping cart part of the site is secure, so that your order details are encrypted in your browser before they are sent to us. The order is then processed on a server that is not connected to the Internet.
