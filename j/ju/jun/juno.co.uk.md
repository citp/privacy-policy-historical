# Help » Privacy Policy

**Our policy**  
Juno Records takes the privacy of its customers very seriously, and we will treat your data with respect. We will only collect information in order to fulfil customer orders, provide information via our email new release lists, personalise your shopping experience on the website or seek your feedback regarding our services. We do not sell mailing lists or share customer information with any other companies or individuals.

**Information collected**  
To place an order, we require your name, email address, delivery address, credit card number, card security code and expiry date. Once the payment has been processed, your credit card security code is not retained on our servers.

To receive our new release information emails, we require only your email address. To enable your order to be delivered, we must share your contact details with the selected postal carrier.

We use Trustpilot to collect feedback from customers who have bought from us. We supply them with your name and email address so they can request optional feedback from you. You can view Trustpilot’s data processing agreement [here](https://legal.trustpilot.com/data-processing-agreement).

If you contact us with a query, we will record your name, email address and, optionally, your order number and post/zip code, for the purposes of resolving your enquiry.

**Cookies**  
As you browse the www.juno.co.uk website, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partner, AdRoll, then enables us to present you with retargeting advertising on other sites based on your previous interaction with www.juno.co.uk. The techniques our partners employ do not collect any personal information. You can visit [this page](https://www.adrollgroup.com/privacy) to opt out of AdRoll and their partners' targeted advertising.

**Security**  
The website is secured with an SSL Certificate, so you can be sure that your activity cannot be tracked by unauthorised third-parties. All activities on the website are encrypted in your browser before they are sent to us. Orders are processed on a server that is not connected to the Internet.
