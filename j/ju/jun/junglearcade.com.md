  1. **Types of Information We Collect**



In order to better provide you with the Site, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and Aggregate Information. 

_Personally Identifiable Information_

: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. 

Examples of PII may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address (including zip code), telephone and facsimile numbers, other identifying information that you provide to us if and when you contact us, and records and copies of your correspondence if you contact us. 

  
_Aggregate Information_ : This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Site and what other sites may have directed you to us. The information we collect includes usage details, IP addresses, and information collected through cookies and other tracking technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, and browsing actions and patterns. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. We may maintain Aggregate Information or associate Aggregate Information with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. This information may include information about your computer and internet connection, including what browser you are using, your operating system and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We also collect information regarding the details of your visits t our Site, such as, the Website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that points to the site you just came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Site, traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Site. 

  2. **How We Collect and Use Information**



  
We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us, such as by sending us an email message or submitting a form or transmitting other information by telephone or letter. 

  
We will primarily use your PII to provide customer support to you. We will also use certain forms of PII to provide the Site to you, recognize when you return to the Site, enhance the operation of our Site, improve our internal marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings, customize our Site's content, layout, and services, contact you about our own and third-parties’ goods and services that may be of interest to you, for any other purpose with you consent, and to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide us the information. We may use PII to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. Finally, we may use your PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy. 

We may also collect, and our third party advertising partners may collect, certain Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Site and to gather demographic information. Our third party advertising partners may also provide us with aggregate, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at out Site.
