 **Cookies  
** You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see [Cookie usage and storage](https://www.jurysinns.com/privacy_and_security#cookies).

 **Change of purpose  
** We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please [_Contact us_](https://www.jurysinns.com/privacy_and_security#contact).

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

## Disclosures of your personal data

We may have to share your personal data with the categories of parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.

  * Other companies in the Jurys Group based within the European Economic Area involved in providing services to you, whether directly or providing underlying infrastructure services.
  * External third parties, including:
  * business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you. These include contractors who provide services provided to you such as Wi-Fi, providers of our call centre services, the system through which travel agents make bookings, as well as the providers of our IT infrastructure;
  * analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our services and website;
  * professional advisers, including lawyers, banks, auditors and insurers;
  * HM Revenue and Customs, regulators and other authorities;
  * entities involved in credit checking and anti-fraud activities, crime prevention/detection, risk assessment and management and dispute resolution.
  * If __ you visit Jurys Inns as part of a group event or meeting, information collected for meeting and event planning may be shared with the organizers of those meetings and events, and, where appropriate, guests who organize or participate in the meeting or event
  * Third parties whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.



Where these third parties are our processors, we require them to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party processors to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.  Some of the third parties mentioned above, for example many professional advisers and HM Revenue and Customs, are controllers who, like us, are subject to specific obligations under data protection law, and who will have their own privacy notices setting out how they deal with personal data.

Where there are health clubs in our hotels, these are operated by a separate third party company 3D Leisure.  They are an independent controller, so they too will have specific obligations under data protection law and their own privacy notice.

## International Transfers

We share your personal data within the Jurys Group. All companies in the Group are currently based in the European Economic Area ( **EEA** ).

Though we do not seek actively to transfer personal data outside the EEA, some of the external third parties we deal with are based outside the EEA or process personal data outside the EEA, so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we look to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

  * Transferring your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
  * Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. We do this (for example) in connection with our providers for booking through travel agents, this data is processed in the US.
  * Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.



Please [_Contact us_](https://www.jurysinns.com/privacy_and_security#contact) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

  


## Data security

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. Processors we appoint will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## Data retention

 **How long will you use my personal data for?** We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for seven years after the transaction in question. We also need to keep information for that period to be able to deal with any dispute.

In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see [_Request erasure_](https://www.jurysinns.com/privacy_and_security#erasure) below for further information.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## Your legal rights ****

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to enable us to deal with your request or to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or we have received a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

 **Your legal rights** You have the right to:

  *  **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. [Download the Subject Access Request form](https://web.archive.org/files/pdfs/subject_access_request_form.pdf).


  *  **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. [Download the Right to Correction form](https://web.archive.org/files/pdfs/the_right_of_rectification_correction_form.pdf).


  *  **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. [Download the Right to Delete form](https://web.archive.org/files/pdfs/the_right_to_delete_form.pdf).


  *  **Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on our legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. [Download the Right to Object to Processing form](https://web.archive.org/files/pdfs/the_right_to_object_to_processing_form.pdf).


  *  **Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following situations: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. [Download the Right to Restriction form](https://web.archive.org/files/pdfs/the_right_to_restriction_of_processing_form.pdf).


  *  **Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. [Download the Request to Transfer form](https://web.archive.org/files/pdfs/the_right_to_data_portability_form.pdf).


  *  **Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. [Download the Right to Withdraw Consent form](https://web.archive.org/files/pdfs/the_right_to_withdraw_consent_form.pdf).
