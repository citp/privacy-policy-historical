# Privacy & Security Policy

## Privacy and Security

At Jurys Inn, the privacy and protection of personal data is treated with the utmost seriousness. Our privacy statement, below, sets out the data protection practices currently in place within the company.

## Privacy statement

We fully endorse and adhere to the principles of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. Specifically, we state that we will: 

  * Obtain and process information fairly.
  * Keep it only for one or more specified, explicit and lawful purpose.
  * Use and disclose it only in ways compatible with these  purposes.
  * Keep it safe and secure.
  * Keep it accurate, complete and up to date.
  * Ensure that it is adequate, relevant and not excessive.
  * Retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purpose or purposes.
  * Give a copy of his/her personal data to that individual, on written request.



## Security statement

This site uses the Secure Sockets Layer protocol to protect your online transaction. Secure Sockets Layer is a security protocol that provides communications privacy over the internet. This allows your computer to communicate with our server in a way that is designed to prevent tampering or message forgery. Your credit card number is also "one-way" encrypted as it enters our databases.

We will take all reasonable care to keep the details of your order and credit card information secure but unless we have been negligent, we will not be liable for any losses you may suffer as a result of unauthorised access by a third party to the information transmitted by you when making reservations at this website.

## Storing of personal data by the human resources department

Please be aware that all personal data and CVs or resumés submitted via jurysinns.com are stored on a secure, dedicated server for a fixed period of six months only. After this, all data is deleted. This data will only be used for the purpose intended. Access to this data is strictly limited to authorised personnel from the Jurys Inn human resources department.

## Cookie usage and storage

We do not store any personal or traceable customer information in the cookies that we use. Additionally, all our cookie data is encrypted to prevent third parties from accessing the information they contain. Each cookie we set lasts only for the duration of each visit.

This information is recorded in a session for a temporary period and is used to enable the booking process to work more smoothly. It is not used for future marketing purposes or disclosed to any third party companies.

Jurys Inn also uses cookies to help us understand how visitors use our site and this information is used solely for the purposes of Jurys Inn to better understand, measure and improve performance of our site and ensure that the content is relevant and our site is user-friendly and easy to use.

 **Managing our marketing relationships**

Our third party marketing partners may set cookies before you reach our site. If you wish to prevent this type of cookie (sometimes known as a 'third party' or 'analytical' cookie), you may do so through your device's browser security settings.

  
You'll sometimes see our advertising or special offers on other websites. Cookies provided by the other website or advertising network can tell us how effective this is. For example, if you click on one of our advertisements, the website owner might use a cookie to tell us that you came from their site.

  
You can choose to disable third party cookies by updating your device settings, [click here for details](http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1)

 **Analytic Cookies**

An HTTP cookie—commonly referred to as just "cookie"—is a parcel of text sent back and forth between a web browser and the server it accesses. Its original purpose was to provide a state management mechanism between a web browser and a web server. Without a cookie (or a similar solution), a web server cannot distinguish between different users, or determine any relationship between sequential page visits made by the same user.

  
For this reason, cookies are used to differentiate one user from another and to pass information from page to page during a single user's website session. A web server uses cookies to collect data about a given browser, along with the information requested and sent by the browser's operator (the visitor).

  
Cookies do not identify people, but rather they are defined themselves by a combination of a computer, a user account, and a browser.

  
Google Analytics tracking (and most web tracking software) uses cookies in order to provide meaningful reports about your site visitors. However, Google Analytics cookies do not collect personal data about your website visitors.
