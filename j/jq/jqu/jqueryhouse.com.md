## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, jQuery House collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. jQuery House’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how jQuery House’s visitors use its website.

jQuery House also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.
