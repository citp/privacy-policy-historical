	<br>
    Morris 4x4 Center uses "cookies" on our site to enable you to save your Jeep information and to expedite any future orders. A "cookie" is a small text file that a website can place on your computer's hard drive in order, for example, to collect information about your activities on the site or to make it possible for you to use an online "shopping cart" to keep track of items you wish to purchase. The cookie transmits this information back to the Web site's computer, which, generally speaking, is the only computer that can read it. Most consumers do not know that "cookies" are being placed on their computers when they visit websites. If you want to know when this happens, or to prevent it from happening, you can set your browser to warn you when a website attempts to place a "cookie" on your computer. Our site relies upon the use of cookies to enhance your shopping experience, but our cookies do not contain nor track your personally identifiable information.  Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website.
