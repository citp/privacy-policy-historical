# WEBSITE USAGE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

WEBSITE USAGE TERMS AND CONDITIONS   
  
### **CHRYSLER AUSTRALIA PTY LTD (CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE)**

In consideration of you viewing this website, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions:

**Privacy Statement**

Chrysler Australia Pty Ltd (“CA”) respects privacy and personal information. Where CA deals with your personal information, being an Australian company CA is governed by and complies with the National Privacy Principles which are found in Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (as amended from time to time). CA collects and uses your information to provide information relating to our products and services that is relevant to your interests.

**Information Collection and Use**

  * CA collects personal information on this website for purposes that are made clear on the page on which the information is collected, such as when you request to be sent information.
  * CA does not collect and process any personal information unless the information is considered necessary for the effective functioning or activities of our business.
  * Generally, CA only processes personal information for the purposes for which it was originally collected, unless required or authorised by or under law or if the individual concerned has consented to the intended use. CA destroys or permanently de-identifies personal information that is no longer needed.
  * CA does not collect and/or process any personal or sensitive information against the express wishes of an individual, unless CA is required by law to do so.
  * You have the right to remain anonymous when entering into transactions with CA, unless such anonymity would be considered unlawful or impracticable.
  * CA does not use or pass onto others any personal information without the consent of the individual(s) concerned unless required by law. Nevertheless, CA’s third party service providers may occasionally have access to the personal information held by CA under conditions of confidentiality.
  * CA takes steps to ensure that personal information is kept safe from misuse, loss and unauthorised access, modification and disclosure.
  * CA will not transfer personal information to a foreign country unless such a transfer is allowed by law.
  * This website, and any other Chrysler Group websites, are not directed at children. If you are under 18 or otherwise would be required to have parent or guardian consent to share information with CA, you should not send any information about yourself to CA. If a person under 18 submits information through any part of a Chrysler website, and CA learns the person submitting the information is a child, CA will attempt to delete this information as soon as possible. Because CA does not knowingly collect any personal information from persons under 18, CA does not use or disclose such information to third parties.



**Web site privacy practices**

  * CA sometimes uses cookie technology on this site in order to provide information and services to website visitors. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes and are a necessary part of facilitating online transactions. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. Cookies are useful to estimate our number of users and determine overall traffic patterns through our website.
  * If you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies. This may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of the services available on our website.



**Other Information Uses and Disclosure**

  * CA may use information relating to your visit to our website, or information you provide to us, for market research purposes in order to continually improve the product and service that CA delivers to you.
  * On occasions, CA may form relationships with other organisations, designed to bring you special offers or competitions, relevant to your preferences. CA only deals with parties that demonstrate the same level of commitment to your privacy as CA does, and can assure complete compliance with all Australian privacy laws.
  * In the unlikely event that CA sells a part or the whole of its business, its records of personal information may be transferred to the new business owner. The information will remain subject to privacy laws and until further notified, will remain subject to CA’s privacy policy. If at any stage you are receiving communications from CA and you do not wish to receive any further communications, please let us know.



**Public Areas**

Any information disclosed in public areas of a CA website or application or other website (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) will become public information. CA cannot control the use of information disclosed in public forums, such as forums, bulletin boards, blogs, chat rooms, and networking functions of mobile-device applications. You should exercise caution when disclosing information in these public areas, especially your location-data, and be careful how you disclose your personal information. Content posted in public areas of CA websites or applications, including advice and opinions, represent the views and is the responsibility of those who post the content. CA does not necessarily endorse, support, verify, or agree with the content posted and reserves the right to remove comments that CA considers to be offensive, derogatory or otherwise inappropriate.

**Further questions**

At all times, CA strives to ensure your personal information is treated confidentially, and in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). If you believe your personal information has been handled in a way that does not comply with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), or if you wish to access information that CA holds about you, please contact us. For security reasons, we require that requests for personal information are provided in writing. CA will endeavour to provide you with this access unless CA is required or authorised to refuse such access by the laws of Australia. All such enquiries should be directed to:

**Product Variations**

Some of the product information illustrations and images contained on this site may have been prepared for generic use on sites that are maintained in different countries around the world.

This information is provided by CA "as is" and to the extent permitted by law, is provided without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, including (but not limited to) any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, or non-infringement.

**No Licenses**

CA has sought to achieve an innovative and informative site. We hope that you will be as enthusiastic as we are about this creative effort.

We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other websites, as they may differ from ours. **These terms and conditions apply solely to personal information collected by CA on its websites.**
