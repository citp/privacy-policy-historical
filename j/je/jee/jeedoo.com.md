With regard to data collected during the registration process for the purpose of fulfilling a contract or for carrying out pre-contractual measures, this is the case if the data are no longer necessary for the performance of the contract.

E. Rights of data subjects  
If you process personal data, you are i.S.d. DSGVO and you have the following rights, as far as no exceptions are relevant, to:  
1\. Right to information  
You, as the affected person, have the right to ask the person responsible for a confirmation as to whether personal data relating to you will be processed; If this is the case, you have a right to be informed about this personal data and to the information listed in detail in Art. 15 GDPR.

Moreover, as the data subject, you have the right to demand from the person responsible without delay the correction of incorrect personal data concerning you and possibly the completion of incomplete personal data (Art. 16 GDPR).

3\. Right to restriction of processing  
Furthermore, the data subject has the right to demand that the person responsible for the processing be restricted if one of the conditions listed in Art. 18 GDPR is fulfilled, eg. For example, if the data subject has objected to processing for the duration of the review by the controller.

4\. Right to cancellation  
Finally, as the data subject, you have the right to require the person responsible to delete your personal data without delay if one of the reasons detailed in Art. 17 GDPR is applicable, eg. For example, if the data is no longer needed for the purposes pursued (right to delete).

5\. Right to information  
If you have the right of rectification, erasure or restriction of processing to the controller, he / she is obliged to notify all recipients to whom your personal data have been disclosed of this correction or deletion of the data or restriction of processing, unless: this proves to be impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.  
You have a right to the person responsible to be informed about these recipients.

6\. Right to Data Portability  
You have the right to receive personally identifiable information you provide to the controller in a structured, common and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transfer this information to another person without hindrance by the controller to whom the personal data has been provided, provided that:  
1\. the processing on a consent acc. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO or on a contract acc. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO is based and  
2\. the processing is done using automated procedures.  
In exercising this right, you also have the right to obtain that your personal data relating to you are transmitted directly from one person to another, insofar as this is technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons may not be affected.  
The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority delegated to the controller.

7\. Right to object  
You have the right at any time, for reasons that arise from your particular situation, against the processing of your personal data, which pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f DSGVO takes an objection; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.

The controller will no longer process the personal data concerning you unless he can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the purpose of enforcing, exercising or defending legal claims.  
If the personal data relating to you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct mail.  
If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes.  
Regardless of Directive 2002/58 / EC, you have the option, in the context of the use of information society services, of exercising your right to object through automated procedures that use technical specifications.

8\. Right to revoke the data protection consent declaration  
You have the right to revoke your data protection declaration at any time. The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.

9\. Automated decision on a case-by-case basis, including profiling  
You have the right not to be subjected to a decision based solely on automated processing - including profiling - that will have legal effect or similarly affect you in a similar manner. This does not apply if the decision  
1\. is required for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract between you and the person responsible,  
2\. is permitted by Union or Member State legislation to which the controller is subject, and where such legislation contains appropriate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or  
3\. with your express consent.  
However, these decisions must not be based on special categories of personal data under Art. 9 (1) GDPR, unless Art. 9 (2) lit. a or g DSGVO applies and reasonable measures have been taken to protect the rights and freedoms as well as your legitimate interests.  
With regard to the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the person responsible shall take appropriate measures to uphold the rights and freedoms and their legitimate interests, including at least the right to obtain the intervention of a person by the controller, to express his / her own position and heard on challenge of the decision.
