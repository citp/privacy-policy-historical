## Protecting your security

We may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks.

This is done only to confirm your identity - a credit check is not performed and your credit rating is unaffected.

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") . It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for or one of our suppliers. Such processing may, for example, be required in order to fulfill your order, process your payment details or provide support services.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your personal data, but cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access.

If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies . Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

## Checking your Details

If you wish to verify the details you have submitted, you may do so by contacting us via email. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information. This proof of identity will take the form of your e-mail address and password submitted upon registration. You must therefore keep this information safe as you will be responsible for any action we take in response to a request from someone using your email and password. We strongly recommend that you do not use your browser's password memory function as it might permit others using your terminal to access your personal information.
