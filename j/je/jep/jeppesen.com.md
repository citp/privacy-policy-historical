##  JEPPESEN PRIVACY POLICY 

WH/Date of Last Revision: 2 May 2015 

###  1\. Purpose 

Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. (a United States based company), and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates ("Jeppesen") are required to comply with applicable law and regulations regarding Personal Information.  This policy establishes high-level responsibilities to ensure that the collection, use, disclosure and retention of Personal Information complies with applicable law and regulations in multiple jurisdictions.  Due to variations in the regulations, many aspects of compliance can only be implemented at the local level. 

####  1.1 Safe Harbor 

Jeppesen’s US entities abide by the Safe Harbor framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, disclosure and retention of Personal Information collected from the European Union. Learn more about the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Program. 

###  2\. Application of Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) 

Jeppesen is committed to providing reasonable protection from loss, inappropriate use, or inappropriate disclosure of the Personal Information that is entrusted to the company. In an effort to provide protection that is as consistent as possible for all individuals who provide Personal Information to the company, Jeppesen has established a privacy program that is based on the Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) identified by the Assurance Services Executive Committee (ASEC) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Assurance Services Development Board (ASDB) of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA). These ten principles (covering Management, Notice, Choice and Consent, Collection, Use and Retention, Access, Disclosure to Third Parties, Security for Privacy, Quality, Monitoring and Enforcement) were developed to serve as a universal framework of privacy best practices that companies can use to evaluate their programs and develop sound policies and practices. 

####  2.1 Management 

Accountability for Data Privacy at Jeppesen has been assigned to the Data Privacy Office (DPO).  Responsibilities of the DPO include: 

  * Ensuring that processes have been implemented for the appropriate collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal information in accordance with applicable law and the [Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) ](http://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/InformationTechnology/Resources/Privacy/GenerallyAcceptedPrivacyPrinciples/DownloadableDocuments/GAPP_BUS_%200909.pdf). 
  * Ensuring that privacy plans in compliance with Data Privacy laws and regulations are documented in writing and implemented. 
  * Provision of guidance, consultation and training regarding privacy issues. 
  * Compliance with privacy plans including: 
    * Performing monitoring and annual verifications for compliance with existing privacy plans.  Verifications include ongoing monitoring and enforcement of privacy plans.  This includes, but is not limited to, re-certification to the Department of Commerce for Safe Harbor 
    * Coordination and alignment with Boeing’s Global Privacy Office whenever appropriate 
    * Follow up on any deficiencies or opportunities for improvement.  The DPO will maintain verification records and respond to any inquiries or complaints. 
    * Maintenance and assignment of data privacy training materials 
    * Assurance that reliable methods for dispute resolution and incident response are available and clearly communicated 
  * Providing support to business owners by assessing products and services to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws 
  * Responsibility for the Enforcement principle of the Safe Harbor Program. 



####  2.2 Notice 

Jeppesen will notify individuals about the purposes for which they collect, use, disclose and retain information about them. Jeppesen will also provide information about how individuals can contact Jeppesen with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which it discloses the information and the choices and means Jeppesen offers for limiting its collection, use, disclosure and retention. 

####  2.3 Choice and Consent 

Jeppesen will give individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) when their Personal Information will be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. For sensitive information, affirmative or explicit choice(opt in) will be given if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose subsequently authorized. 

####  2.4 Collection 

Personal Information is collected only for the reasons provided in the Uses Permitted.  This defined scope is included in the Product or Service privacy notice.  If the scope requires redefinition, the privacy notice will be reissued and Data Collection will be subject to 2.3 Choice and Consent once again. 

#####  2.4.1 Special Notice Regarding Children 

Jeppesen Sites are not designed for, nor is Personal Information knowingly collected from children under the age of 13. Children under 13 years of age should not provide Personal Information to Jeppesen or Affiliates.

Children under the age of 18 may only use the Services with involvement of a parent or guardian. 

#####  2.4.2 Third Party Sites 

Jeppesen websites may contain links to other sites, or other interactive forums hosted by a third party. Jeppesen may also use certain third party sites such as Facebook, YouTube, iTunes and Google Play, for purposes such as providing information about products and services, communicating with Customers and the general public, or distributing Jeppesen products or services. These websites may also include buttons, tools, or content that link to third parties (for example, a Facebook "Like" button). Information may also be collected concerning Customer use of these features. In addition, when interacting with these buttons, tools, or content, or viewing a Jeppesen web page containing them, some Customer browser information may automatically be sent to that third party.  Jeppesen is not responsible for the non-Jeppesen content or the privacy practices of such other sites. Customers are encouraged to read the privacy policies of any third party web site that collects information.  Similarly, if entering Jeppesen websites via another web site, Jeppesen is not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of that site, and the privacy policy of the third-party site should be reviewed before providing any information to that site. This Policy applies solely to Personal Information collected by Jeppesen. 

#####  2.4.3 Collection from Social Media sites 

Personal Information may also be collected in connection with "liking", posting, commenting or otherwise contacting Jeppesen or its Affiliates via web pages or content that Jeppesen administers on third-party sites such as Facebook or YouTube. 

#####  2.4.4 Use of cookies, IP addresses and web beacon 

Jeppesen advertises online in a variety of ways, including displaying ads across the Internet and on the Sites. Information is collected about which ads are displayed, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ad was displayed.  
The Sites and some services and advertisements may contain "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on an individual’s hard drive and records preferences and other data about a visit to the Sites. Like many websites, Jeppesen.com does not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers.  Clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons) may also be used on the Sites. E-mails sent may include a clear gif that tells whether an e-mail was received or opened, or if a link within the e-mail was clicked. Individuals may opt out of receiving marketing communications.  Jeppesen or its Affiliates may also use a third party advertising company to display ads on the Sites.  
NOTE: If cookies are blocked, some portions of the Sites may not function properly. 

####  2.5 Use, retention and disposal 

Jeppesen will use an individual’s Personal Information only for Uses Permitted stated herein or in the Product or Service privacy notice and will only be provided to parties with a need to know.  Reasonable attempts to use anonymized data will be made prior to disclosure. 

When an account is terminated, Jeppesen will only be entitled to retain Personal Information pursuant to applicable information retention policies.  Personal Information will be deleted at the conclusion of the applicable retention policy retention period. 

####  2.6 Access 

Individuals may request access to Personal Information about them that Jeppesen holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.  If an individual would like to have access to Personal Information Jeppesen holds about them, please e-mail [privacy@jeppesen.com](mailto:privacy@jeppesen.com), or write to Jeppesen, Data Privacy Office, 55 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, CO 80112.

To make such a request, please send an email to [privacy@jeppesen.com](mailto:privacy@jeppesen.com). Written requests may be sent to Jeppesen, Attention: Data Privacy Office, 55 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, CO 80112-5498. Please note that not all information sharing is covered under the California law, and only information on covered sharing will be included in any response. 

####  2.7 Disclosure to Third Parties 

Prior to any transfer of Personal Information to third parties, Jeppesen will ensure that the third parties subscribe to the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor principles or are subject to adequate Data Privacy laws and regulations.  As an alternative, Jeppesen can enter into a written agreement with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by relevant principles (for example, European data privacy contract model clauses).  
In some cases, an individual’s Personal Information may be disclosed by Jeppesen, as part of International Trip Planning services, to recipients located in countries that may not offer a level of protection as high as the level of protection in the country where Jeppesen and its Affiliates are established. 

####  2.8 Security for Privacy
