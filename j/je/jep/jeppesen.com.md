##  JEPPESEN PRIVACY POLICY 

WH/Date of Last Revision: 8 October 2012 

####  Your California Privacy Rights 

Under California law, customers who are California residents are entitled to annually request and obtain information about the personal information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing. If applicable, the information would include the categories of personal information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared personal information for the immediately prior calendar year. To make such a request, please send an email to [privacy@jeppesen.com](mailto:privacy@jeppesen.com). Written requests may be sent to Jeppesen, Attention: Chief Counsel, 55 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, CO 80112-5498. Please note that not all information sharing is covered under the California law, and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response. 

####  SCOPE 

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates("Jeppesen", "we" or "us") when you make a purchase from us, use our products and services, or use our web sites operated by Jeppesen that link to this Policy including www.jeppesen.com, and www.jeppdirect.com (the "Sites"), and the services associated therewith. Please take a moment to read this Policy to learn more about our information practices. When you use the Sites you are interacting with a United States based company and the Sites are intended to meet the laws of the United States. 

####  THIRD PARTY SITES 

The Sites may contain links to other sites, or other interactive forums hosted by a third party. Jeppesen may also use certain third party sites such as Facebook, YouTube, iTunes and Google Play, for purposes such as providing information about products and services, communicating with customers and the general public, or distributing Jeppesen products or services. The Sites may also include buttons, tools, or content that link to third parties (for example, a Facebook "Like" button). We may collect information about your use of these features. In addition, when you see or interact with these buttons, tools, or content, or view a Jeppesen web page containing them, some information from your browser may automatically be sent to that third party. Please be aware that although we may participate in, link to, or utilize such other sites and features, and may collect information when you interact with such sites or features, we are not responsible for the non-Jeppesen content or the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Sites or interact with third party features and to read the privacy policies of any web site that collects information. Similarly, if you entered the Sites through another web site, we are also not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of that site, and you should review the privacy policy of the third-party site before providing any information to that site. This Policy applies solely to personal information collected by Jeppesen. 

####  CHANGES TO THIS POLICY 

We reserve the right to change the provisions of this privacy policy at any time by posting the revised Policy on the Sites and indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy whenever you visit our Sites to determine if any changes have been made and to make sure that you understand how personal information you provide will be treated. 

####  PERSONAL INFORMATION 

As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as user's name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual) or that is associated with an identifiable person (such as demographic information or information about a person's activities when such information is linked to personally identifying information). Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Sites or categories of Sites users, from which any personal information has been removed. We collect aggregate data for a number of purposes, including helping us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new publications, products and services, and tailor existing publications, products and services to user desires. This policy in no way limits or restricts our collection of aggregate information. 

####  COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We may collect personal information in a number of ways when you purchase and use products or services from Jeppesen, visit our Sites or use the various services available on our Sites. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, if you register for an account on the Sites, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, and city and country and we may collect other demographic information that you provide. Personal information may also be collected if you purchase or access products and/or services using the Sites or provide such information in your profile or in connection with leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any interactive areas or using features on the Sites; or in connection with "liking", posting, commenting or otherwise contacting Jeppesen via pages or content that we administer on third-party sites such as Facebook or YouTube. 

In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, contests, promotional offers and other activities on the Sites. 

We may also receive information from third parties with whom we have business relationships. If we combine this information with the other personal information we have collected, this Policy governs our use and disclosure of such information. 

####  SPECIAL NOTICE REGARDING CHILDREN 

Our Sites are not designed for, nor do we knowingly collect, personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years of age, please do not provide your personal information to us. To use the Services available on the Sites, you must be at least 18 years old and competent to enter into a contract. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use the Services with involvement of a parent or guardian. 

####  EU SAFE HARBOR 

Jeppesen abides by the safe harbor framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected from the European Union. Learn more about the [U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Program](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor)

####  USE OF COOKIES, IP ADDRESSES AND WEB BEACONS 

Jeppesen advertises online in a variety of ways, including displaying ads to you across the Internet and on Jeppesen's Sites. We collect information about which ads are displayed, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ad was displayed. 

The Sites and some services and advertisements on our Sites, may contain "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your hard drive and records your preferences and other data about your visit to the Sites. Clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons) may also be used on the Sites. Emails we send you may include a clear gif that tells us whether you have received or opened the email, or clicked a link within the email. If you do not want us to collect this information from Jeppesen marketing emails, you can opt out of receiving marketing emails as described below. Clear gifs are small, invisible graphic images that allow the collection of certain information and monitor user activity on the Sites. We use cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technology to customize your experience with our Sites. If we combine cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis or other technology with or link them to any personally identifiable information, we will treat this information as personal information in accordance with this Policy. Most internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. If you block cookies, some portions of the Sites may not function properly. 

We do not control cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis or other technology in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use. We may also use a third party advertising company to display ads on the Sites. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on the Sites and other Web sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [please click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp). 

####  USAGE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

In general, we use personal information we collect to facilitate your use of the Sites, to provide you with information, products and services you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to administer and assist us with the operation of the Sites and of our business, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. For example, we may use the information we collect to: 

  * customize your Jeppesen homepage; 
  * contact you about your use of the Sites, such as for administrative purposes or to provide you with customer service; 
  * provide you with the services, products or information you requested, process payments and complete any transactions in connection therewith; 
  * respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints; 
  * contact you about our or a third party's products, services, activities, events, promotions or offers and for other marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes; and 
  * request feedback and to enable us to develop, customize and improve our information and services. 



####  SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION 

If we collect any personal information, we share and disclose such personal information only as described in this Policy (as amended from time to time). 

We may share personal information with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Sites or performing any services on our behalf. For example, we may use a third party to screen certain content before it is posted to the Sites. In addition, we may offer various features through a third party service provider. When you use these services, you are providing information directly to the provider of these services, and the provision of such information is subject to such party's own privacy policy. We are not responsible for any information you provide to these parties directly, and we encourage you to become familiar with the practices of third parties before disclosing information directly to such third parties with which you may come into contact. 

We also may disclose personal information when we are required to or we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply this privacy policy or our other policies or agreements; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our or our customers' rights, property or safety; to protect our customers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Site; or if we believe that an emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of personal information. In addition, information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personally identifiable information could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets of the Company. 

####  ONLINE COMMUNITIES 

The Sites may include certain online communities and other interactive features, such as user profiles, forums, message boards and chat rooms. (For purposes of this Section, this does not include third party sites such as Facebook in which Jeppesen is a participant. See "Third-Party Sites" above for more information.) You may be asked to choose a user or member name and password in order to participate in certain features of the Services. Your user name will be available to the general public while you participate in some features of the Services, such as the online communities. Please do not use your real name for online communities. Information you post in such public areas of the Sites is publicly available and may be viewed by and shared with other users. We are not responsible for protecting such information that you may disclose to third parties through the Sites (e.g. sending your contact information to another user). 

####  PROTECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION 

We strive to protect personal information while it is under our control. Your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To help protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Sites by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been compromised or misused. 

####  CHOICE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR INFORMATION 

You may "opt out" to not receive promotional and marketing emails by viewing your account profile information. Please note, however, that as long as you maintain an account, you may not "opt out" of receiving service or account-related emails from Jeppesen. 

####  CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, QUESTIONS 

If you would like to verify, correct or delete any personal information we have collected, or if you have any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or Jeppesen's treatment of personal information, please contact us at [privacy@jeppesen.com](mailto:privacy@jeppesen.com), or by writing to us at Jeppesen, Legal Department, 55 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, CO 80112. You may also correct certain information by using the "Account" and "Profile" section of the Sites. Please note that in certain circumstances, we may not, or may not be able to, remove or change certain information. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is Jeppesen's policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. For Safe Harbor related concerns, if we are unable to reach a resolution, we will utilize a third party independent recourse mechanism to investigate and resolve the dispute.
