# Privacy Policy | Jewish Journal

### Newspaper

Your privacy is important, so we’d like to explain what information we collect when you visit Jewish Journal Online ([http://www.jewishjournal.com](http://www.jewishjournal.com/ "http://www.jewishjournal.com")), why we collect it and how it is used. We’d also like to explain your options to access and control your information, our data security practices and other matters. This Policy is governed by our Terms of Service.

## WE GIVE KIDS SPECIAL PROTECTION

Some areas of our Site are for children under 13. We generally don’t collect, use or give out personal information about kids without prior parental consent. We don’t use online games, prizes or other features to obtain more personal information from kids than we really need. We use reasonable security measures to protect any collected information (see below for more ways we protect kids). Web sites with features directed to children under 13 or which knowingly collect personal information from children, are required by U.S. law to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using or giving out such information to others.

## WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT FROM YOU? WHY?

**We May Profile You Individually.**

We may build a profile of your online habits, interests and activities when you use our Site. This profile is linked to your personal identity. We compile individual profiles from email addresses, and we use these profiles for the purposes described below (please scroll down to each topic for details).

**We May Profile Users Pseudononymously**

We may build a pseudononymous profile of your online habits, interests and activities when you use our Site. This profile will not reveal or be linked to your personal identity. We compile these profiles from information about user PCs (e.g., IP address or browser type), user navigation and browsing patterns, demographic information (e.g., gender, marital status, age, income, job), the personal preferences of users (i.e., favorite color, music, books), and we use these profiles for the purposes described below (please scroll down to each topic for details).

**Parents: We won’t collect personal contact information from your child without your consent, except** : we may respond once to their email, let them join an email newsletter (which you may cancel) and use the information to protect them, our system and to comply with the law. You can access, review and permanently remove such data by calling The Jewish Journal Subscriptions Department at 213-368-1661 or clicking on the unsubscribe button on the bottom of each newsletter which will automatically remove your child from our list.

## WHAT ARE COOKIES? WHY DO WE USE THEM?

Cookies are small files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit our Site. We use cookies to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. We also use cookies to help build a pseudonymous profile of your online habits, interests and activities as you navigate our site, which we use to individualize your visits. This profile is not linked to your personal identity. We also use cookies to help build a pseudonymous profile of your online habits, interests and activities as you navigate our site, which we use for general research, analysis and reporting. We mostly use “session cookies” that are automatically deleted after each visit. Cookies from our Site can’t be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change browser settings to refuse them.

## HOW DO WE PROTECT INFORMATION WE COLLECT?

We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.

## HOW LONG DO WE KEEP USER INFORMATION?

We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.

Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.

## YOUR CONSENT TO THIS POLICY

By using our Site, you agree to this Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our Terms of Service take precedence over any conflicting Policy provision. We may change our Policy by posting a new version on our Site. If we collect personal information from children and later materially change our practices for collected data, we will obtain new parental consent for those practices.

## LEGAL DISCLAIMER

This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond our direct control. This Policy is governed by California law, excluding conflicts of law principles. Any legal actions against us must be commenced in California within one year after the claim arose, or be barred.

## IF YOU HAVE A PRIVACY QUESTION

If you have a privacy question about our Site, please email: Jay Firestone at [webmaster@jewishjournal.com](mailto:webmaster@jewishjournal.com). Or write: Tribe Media Corp., Attn: Jay Firestone, 3580 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1510, Los Angeles, California, 90010. Or call us at (213) 368-1661.
