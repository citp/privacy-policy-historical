# Disclaimer, Site Use, and Privacy Policy

JewishGen has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: 

### Site Use

All information contained on this site is being provided by JewishGen, Inc. as a public service for the furtherance of your **personal** genealogical research. Any information contained as part of any database, text file or HTML file is not intended nor should it be used for the solicitation of paid research, solicitation for contributions or support for a non-JewishGen project or for any commercial use, school related projects, term papers or interviews for the purpose of publication without the express written permission of the appropriate copyright holder. 

### Information Automatically Logged

For purposes of analyzing the traffic we receive at our Web site, we log your domain name. For example, if you are an America On-line user, we retain that there was a visit from a AOL user, but we do not even know your complete e-mail address. 

### Use of Your Personal Information

If you submit messages to the JewishGen Discussion group, it will include your name and e-mail address. We retain this information in the Discussion Group archives. We do not use this information, but we cannot prevent other persons from using it. In fact, the purpose of the archives is to allow other genealogists to contact you if you have provided information of interest to them. 

If you participate in the JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF) project, you will provide your name, e-mail address, postal address and telephone number. When you enter your data, you determine which address information will be displayed to any user of the JGFF. The information you decide to have displayed can be captured for uses beyond our control by anyone searching the JGFF. JewishGen may provide this information, on a very limited basis, to other genealogy groups, but only if you have given us permission to do so. For example if a group requests a list of all persons with interests in Lithuania, and in our judgement the planned use is to further the interests of Jewish genealogy, we provide such a list. If we turn down the request, the group is still capable of gathering the names and addresses by capturing your name and address information from the computer screen as described above. 

If you participate in the Family Tree of the Jewish People (FTJP) by submitting a GEDCOM file, the personal information you have already provided to the JewishGen Family Finder (JGFF) is automatically linked. This information consists of your researcher code, your e-mail address and postal address as well as a telephone number if supplied. None of this private information is provided to anyone. If an FTJP user wishes to communicate with you, we forward the initial message without giving your name or address. It is your decision to reply or not. 

If at any future date JewishGen determines that the FTJP will be used for anything other than personal genealogical pursuits, you will be notified and can then determine if you wish to participate or not. 

If you contribute money to JewishGen through our JewishGen-erosity program, we do not share your name or other information provided to us with any other person or organization. 

### External Links

This site contains links to other sites. JewishGen has no knowledge of the privacy practices or content of such Web sites. 

### Contacting JewishGen

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, your dealings with this site, or if you have been contacted for any reason by another organization or individual, please email to [support@jewishgen.org](mailto:support@jewishgen.org).
