# Privacy Policy | Jeffers Pet

Your trust is important to us. Jeffers strives to make your shopping experience as easy and secure as possible. This privacy policy is designed to review how we collect and use information you provide. Any questions or feedback are welcome.

## Information we collect and how we use it:

We collect information about your visit to our site. If you enter your email address, opt in to emails, or make a purchase we may collect personal and technical information about you, your visit and your recent purchases. This may include email address, name, address, phone numbers, gender, order information, product interests, content topic, interests, loyalty information, customer number, etc. in addition to information about your visit such as IP Address, operating system, location information and other device information. We may record additional information about your visit including the pages you viewed on the site/s, products you browsed or placed in an online shopping cart as well as any content pages you have viewed. We collect this information about you and your preferences to create a profile of your interests and to serve you personalized content on websites and/or via personalized marketing promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. In some cases, we may automatically enroll you in marketing campaigns based on your product interests or past purchases.

You may voluntarily disclose additional personal information about yourself inside of a preference center or as part of a contest or sweepstakes, at a trade show, by taking a survey, contacting us by phone, or entering information into our website forms. By providing this additional personal information you authorize us to use this information in connection with personalized marketing promotions and interest-based advertising.

You may optionally rate or review a product by entering your email, a star rating, and short text. By providing your review you authorize us to disclose your endorsement to other shoppers interested in that product.

In order to measure the performance of marketing campaigns we monitor actions you take in connection with our marketing campaigns including links clicked, order total, pages visited, and other relevant data. We use cookies to recognize you when you use or return to a site to provide a continuous, personalized shopping experience.

We use retargeting cookies and allow carefully screened 3rd party service providers to provide interest-based advertisements to you on this or other websites, or by direct mailing. We may also send direct mail if you have provided a mailing address. Some 3rd party companies have their own tracking technologies that we do not control.

If you use our "tell a friend" option on a product page or email, we will use their name and email address to deliver a one-time email message to them.

We may combine information we collect with other information you have disclosed or by using 3rd party services. This is used to better serve you with relevant products, services, content, or to improve our company.

We may disclose information as required by law, court orders, subpoenas, to 3rd parties in the course of an investigation, or to protect Jeffers or its customers from harm, fraud, or security threats. In addition, we may share information to investigate technical problems or threats, violations of terms and conditions, or to protect the integrity of the website.

## Tracking Technology:

Jeffers uses standard tracking technology. Some of the technology we use to collect information include cookies, tags, pixels, and web beacons. Some of our 3rd party services use these technologies to collect information on our behalf. For example, we use Google Analytics to learn about our customer's interaction with the website.

## Your Options:

You have the right to be removed from emails or direct mailings. You may unsubscribe directly from the email, or by contacting us. To opt out of direct mail, please contact us at 1-800-533-3377 or use the address at the end of this policy.

In addition, you may use your browser's tools to block storage of information. This may make many features unavailable, including cart and checkout. This is browser and device specific.

Jeffers does not have a "do not track" feature. By using this website, you are consenting to our practices and policies. You may be removed from internet-based advertising at [http://optout.aboutads.info](http://optout.aboutads.info/). This only impacts advertising networks that participate, such as Google, AOL and Yahoo. This is also browser and device specific. This service is operated independently and is beyond the control of Jeffers.

Additionally, we have links to outside websites that we deem helpful to you, the customer. We do not control any tracking or content of those websites.

## Security Measures:

Jeffers uses reasonable and appropriate physical, administrative, and technical controls to protect your personal information. Our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, the industry standard in transferring information when handling personal information. We do not store credit cards on our site, but we do pass it to our credit card processing company, which assigns it a token that we can use for payment settlements. Agents, contractors, and partners of Jeffers who have access to your personal information in connection with providing services for Jeffers are required to keep the information confidential and are not permitted to use this information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are rendering for Jeffers.

Jeffers keeps personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this policy. We also keep information as otherwise required by law.

Although Jeffers makes every effort to keep your data safe, data transmissions through the internet are not without risks. We take many precautions, but we cannot guarantee complete safety for this, or any other website. Please be advised, Jeffers will never request sensitive information through email.
