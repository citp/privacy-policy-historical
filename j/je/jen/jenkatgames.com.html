            <p>We have created this Privacy
Policy in order to show our commitment to your privacy. The following discloses
our information gathering and dissemination practices. This policy covers all
Jenkat Media, Inc. properties including, but not limited to the following
domains: http://www.jenkatgames.com, http://www.breakplay.com, http://www.gamehug.com, and all other
websites owned and/or operated by Jenkat Media, Inc. ("the Network").</p>

<h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Any personal information that you
provide to our Jenkat Media website(s) will stay safe and secure. </p>

<h3>INFORMATION THAT WE MAY COLLECT
FROM OUR USERS</h3>

<p>We may collect the following
information when you sign up for a service: </p>

<ul>
 <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;- First name, last name, e-mail, postal address,
     country, phone number, gender, birth date, age, uasername, password, and game category
     preferences. </li>
 <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For processing transactions, we also collect
     either credit card information or bank information, depending on your form
     of payment. </li>
</ul>

<h3>IP Address:</h3>

<p>When a user visits any website
owned or operated by Jenkat Media, Inc., we may collect the IP address that
requested the display of one of our sites. This address is collected primarily
for two purposes. The first purpose is to exercise our ability to restrict
access to the site by users who have violated our Terms of Service. The second purpose is to support our advertising partners, 
so that the partners will be able to accurately count the number of unique visitors to our sites who may have viewed a given advertisement. When
a user accesses our Jenkat Media website, our web server may also automatically
collect and store the user's domain name, the date and time of access to the
site and the Internet address of the website that linked you to our site.</p>

<h3>Sign Up and Survey information:</h3>

<p>Any information you provide to us
as part of your use of any Jenkat Media website will be stored as entered. </p>

<h3>Cookies:</h3>

<p>The sole purpose of cookies is to
enhance your online experience. Cookies are small data files that are stored on
your computer by websites. Through your Web browser, cookies are only used by
the website that wrote the cookie. Data stored in a cookie from Jenkat Media is
only accessible by the Jenkat Media websites. The information in our cookies is kept private
and secure. </p>

<h3>USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Your username, e-mail address,
and password will be used to uniquely identify you as a user on any Jenkat
Media website. We may use or display your username for such purposes including,
but not limited to, rankings, competitions, lottery winnings, chat
identification, or game high scores. </p>

<p>Other identifying information
collected during the sign up process or through other voluntary means (e.g.,
via surveys) may be used to calculate aggregate demographics figures.</p>

<p>We use the information that we
collect from users in a variety of ways, including to improve the content of
the website to address user preferences and to attract new users, to track user
trends and patterns on the Internet so that users may be informed about
products and services of interest and, in some instances, to properly credit
third parties that have referred users to the site. Stored information is also
used to pre-populate information fields for purchases, contests or promotions.<br>
<br>
Our advertisers and marketing partners who contract directly with the website
are required to confirm that they will comply with the Network's Privacy Policy
with respect to information collected through ads displayed on any Network
site. Third-party advertising companies use cookies to measure and improve the
effectiveness of their clients' ads. To do this, advertisers may use anonymous
information about a user's visit to a website (as well as other websites)
including what banner ad was shown, the date and time it was shown, the cookie
and the IP address. This information may also be used for online preference
marketing purposes. Visit Network Advertising Initiative's ("NAI")
gateway opt-out site www.networkadvertising.org to review the privacy policies
of third-party advertising companies and/or opt-out of third-party advertising
cookies. </p>

<p>In the event that Jenkat Media,
Inc. merges with another company or transfers or sells substantially all of its
assets to a third party, all information stored on the web server would be
included in the merger, transfer or sale. Also, if required by law, information
may be disclosed to a third party. <br>
<br>
Jenkat Media, Inc. reserves the right to change its privacy policy at any time.
</p>
<h3>SECURITY OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h3>

<p>All data that we collect is
stored on one or more secure database servers that cannot be accessed from
outside our corporate network. Outside of our network, the only access to this
data is that provided through our Jenkat Media websites. Through our sites,
access to personal information is completely controlled by user-defined e-mail
addresses and passwords. Within our corporation, access to data is secured
through a private user ID and password known only to key personnel who maintain
the database. </p>

<h3>E-MAIL/OPT-OUT</h3>

<p>When you sign up as a Jenkat
Media user, or download any software from Jenkat Media, Inc., by default the
option will be selected to allow us to communicate with you via e-mail about
news, games, special offers, and events. You have the option to uncheck or
check a box during the sign up process that will prevent this, although by
doing so you are potentially asking us to not inform you of events and prize
awards that may have tangible value to you. Any e-mail we send to you will
contain information about opting-out of any further mailings, and all Jenkat
Media websites have areas where you may manually opt-out of receiving further
communications. Jenkat Media treats each of its consumer offerings
individually, so if you have opted to receive mailings from more than one
business entity, if you want to unsubscribe you must do so from each entity individually.
</p>

<p>A second communication option is
chosen by default, allowing Jenkat Media to share your information with trusted
partners who may also choose to communicate with you. You also have the choice
to uncheck the box for this option during the sign up process. </p>

<h3>OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>

<p>Your Web browser or client
software that you use to access Jenkat Media may transmit certain geographic
information and information regarding the capabilities or features of your
computer and/or software to us. We may also track other types of information,
such as what games users play, how long our users have been members of any Jenkat
Media businesses or programs, the last time a user visited Jenkat Media
websites, and whether a user has won any of our games, lotteries, jackpots, or
contests. We may use this information to calculate aggregate statistics about
our user community or for security purposes, and may provide such information
to advertisers and/or partners in aggregate form only. </p>

<h3>HOW INFORMATION IS USED</h3>

<p>The information you provide to Jenkat
Media will allow us to notify you about new features, enhancements, resolution
of site problems, handle and/or route your customer support questions and
issues, and inform you of upgrade opportunities, contests, prizes, or special
events. Jenkat Media may use personal information in combination with data from
third parties for similar purposes as well. </p>

<h3>THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING</h3>

<p>It is important that you understand
that advertisers or websites that link to a Jenkat Media website may collect
personal information about you. The Privacy Policy does not apply to, and
cannot control the activities of, other advertisers or websites. We use
third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our sites. These companies
may use information about your visits to this and other sites in order to help
them provide relevant ads to users. </p>

<h3>SHARING INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Jenkat Media may disclose your
personal information to third-party vendors to fulfill prizes in those
instances in which we do not provide prize fulfillment directly. We may also
use your information to process our newsletters or e-mail campaigns, or to
analyze and/or store data. Under some limited and special circumstances, we may
also disclose your information if there is a violation of the Terms of Service
or if we have a good faith belief that the law requires it. It is important
that you understand that we cannot control the activities of such third-party
vendors. While we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and
security procedures as Jenkat Media, we will take all reasonable precautions
under the circumstances to ensure the protection of your personal information. </p>

<h3>CHAT &amp; MESSAGING</h3>

<p>Jenkat Media websites may choose
to operate message boards and/or chat areas where users can exchange ideas and
communicate with one another. When posting to a message board or chat area, it
is important for you to understand that the information is being made publicly
available in an online environment. Any information posted is the sole
responsibility of the individual user. </p>

<h3>Are you concerned about our use
of personal information?</h3>

<p>If, for any reason, you are
concerned with the way that we may be using your personal information, you may
request that we cease to use your information or you may file a complaint by
contacting Jenkat Media Privacy Policy Department, 3578-E Hartsel Drive, #308,
Colorado Springs, CO 80920.</p>

<h3>AGREEMENT WITH JENKAT MEDIA POLICIES</h3>

<p>By using any of the Jenkat Media
websites, products, or services, you signify your understanding and agreement
to the Privacy Policy stated here, and to the Terms of Service. If you do not
agree with our policies, please do not use any of the Jenkat Media websites,
products, or services. </p>
