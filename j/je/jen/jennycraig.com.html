              <h3>Jenny Craig Privacy and Acceptable Use Policy<br><br>
                Privacy</h3>
               <p> Many of the ways in which you interact with our site allow us 
              to learn more about you. We collect and store statistics and other 
              information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated 
              (collective) basis. For example, we track the number of people who 
              view each page to learn which features are the most popular. But 
              in these, and almost all other instances, we do not obtain personally 
              identifiable information about you.
</p><p>In those instances where we do collect personally identifiable 
                information, you have the option of choosing to reveal it to us. 
                Examples of when you voluntarily submit this kind of information 
                include when you fill out the registration page, send us feedback 
                or post in our chat rooms or message boards. In the event of a 
                complaint, we may also receive personally identifiable information 
                about you from other parties in our Network or from other users 
                or third parties who may communicate information to us about you 
                in relation to that complaint.</p>
              <p><b>How We Use and Disclose Your Information</b></p>
              <p>As a general practice, we do not sell your personally identifiable 
                information to third parties. So, for example, we do not sell 
                your email addresses or your name and personal demographic information 
                to mass marketers. We use your information on an aggregated basis 
                to do such things as operate our site, enhance our site, and sell 
                and deliver advertising. We also use this data, both aggregated 
                and personally identifiable, to enhance your on-site experience 
                by displaying content and marketing messages that we believe will 
                be of interest to you. We disclose aggregated information about 
                our site to third parties.</p>
              <p><br>
                Note that some online activities you choose to do necessarily 
                lead to disclosure of your personally identifiable information 
                to third parties. In some situations, we share your personally 
                identifiable information with third parties that provide services 
                to our Network in order to enhance the functionality available 
                to you as part of our site. In some cases we use your personally 
                identifiable information to provide information to you, such as 
                to send newsletters to you that you request.</p>
              <p><b><br>
                Cookies and Other Tracking Methods</b></p>
              <p>Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, 
                not on our site. We use cookies or, in a limited number of cases, 
                IP addresses for a number of reasons. First, cookies allow you 
                to store your password without having to constantly re-enter it. 
                Second, cookies can also help us to tailor a Web site or a marketing 
                message to better match your needs and interests. Third, cookies 
                allow us to better understand how users use our site, which in 
                turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular 
                with our users. You are always free to decline our cookies if 
                your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work 
                properly if you do.</p>
              <p><b>Other Sites</b></p>
              <p>Please note that if you provide any information on your own or 
                directly to parties who provide service to our Network, any merchants 
                in our Store or any other sites you encounter on the Internet 
                (even if these sites are branded with our branding), different 
                rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information 
                you disclose to them. We encourage you to investigate and ask 
                questions before disclosing information to third parties.</p>
              <p><b>Limits On Our Abilities</b></p>
              <p>Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing 
                legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure 
                that your private communications and other personally identifiable 
                information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, 
                we may be forced to disclose information to the government or 
                third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may 
                unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. 
                Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or 
                resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize 
                us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities, 
                law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our discretion 
                or as may be required under law, believe necessary or appropriate.</p>
              <p><b>Security</b></p>
              <p>We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality 
                of your personal identifiable information, such as firewalls and 
                Secure Socket Layers where appropriate. However, "perfect 
                security" does not exist on the Internet. We hope this policy 
                clarifies our procedures regarding your personal information. 
                We at Jenny Craig, Inc. encourage you to learn as much as you 
                can about your privacy on the Internet.</p>
              <p><b>Acceptable Use</b><br>
