# Jessica McClintock - Privacy Policy

**JESSICA McCLINTOCK.COM'S PRIVACY POLICY  
**Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operations of JessicaMcClintock.com, we gather certain types of information about JessicaMcClintock.com users. JessicaMcClintock.com's Privacy Policy (Privacy Policy) explains the types of information we gather, what we do with it and how you may correct or change information that JessicaMcClintock.com may collect. 

**INFORMATION COLLECTED BY JESSICAMcCLINTOCK.COM  
**JessicaMcClintock.com collects two types of information about users: personal information (such as name and e-mail address) and aggregate information (such as information about how many users log on to our sites on a daily basis).

**PERSONAL INFORMATION  
**Personal information is collected when users voluntarily register with JessicaMcClintock.com to purchase items, receive electronic newsletters, use community and communication services, answer surveys and enter contests and other promotional opportunities provided on JessicaMcClintock.com site. We may receive personal usage and demographic information from our affiliates and from third parties, and if you communicate to us by e-mail, we will record the e-mail address from which you send your message.

**AGGREATE INFORMATION  
**One method of collecting aggregate information about your activities online (such as the pages you access most frequently or the search terms you enter), and information volunteered by you (such as survey or registration information), is by tracking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the Web. The computers that deliver the Web pages to you automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from our site, our servers log your IP address. When you visit this site, we automatically record the name of the domain from which you accessed the site and the type of client computer and type of web browser that you use. If you got to the site by means of a link from another site, our computers will note the fact that you came to us from that linked site.

**USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED BY JESSICAMcCLINTOCK.COM  
**The information collected by JessicaMcClintock.com may be used to send you information about our products, services, contests and special promotions being run by JessicaMcClintock.com. We may also use this information to make offers to you and to help us develop and improve JessicaMcClintock.com and tailor our site to your interests.

**SHARING DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES  
**JessicaMcClintock.com may share aggregate information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. We will always request permission to share such information on our site. JessicaMcClintock.com may also share personal information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed, or if JessicaMcClintock.com believes that membership has been used to commit unlawful acts, or acts that may endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general public. In addition, JessicaMcClintock.com receives personal usage and demographic information from its affiliates and from third parties and uses this information to improve our products and services. 

**USE OF COOKIES  
**JessicaMcClintock.com currently does not use "cookies" to record information but intends to use them in the future. A cookie is a small data file that Web sites store on your hard drive when you visit them. Cookies allow us to measure activity on our site and to improve user experience by remembering your passwords and viewing preferences.

JessicaMcClintock.com does not use cookies to retrieve any information from your computer. Your web browser should allow you to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or warn you before it accepts a cookie, so that you can decide whether to accept or reject a cookie generated by a visit to our site. If you prefer, you may set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some parts of our site, such as members-only areas (i.e. shopping, contest and game areas) will not function properly if you choose not to accept cookies. If you are concerned that you might have created a cookie in a previous visit, you can view whatever cookies are already stored on your hard drive by accessing your computer's cookie file. In Windows 95 or higher, click on "Start" and then "Find" and type in "Cookies".
