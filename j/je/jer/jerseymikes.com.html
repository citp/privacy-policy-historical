<dl>
	<dt>What Information Do We Gather?</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>We gather both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.</p>
		<p>Personally Identifiable Information is any information that concerns you individually and would permit someone to contact you, for example, your name, address, telephone/fax number, email address or any information you submit to jerseymikes.com that identifies you individually.</p>
