# Privacy Policy | JEDEC

### JEDEC’s Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available in the site footer which appears throughout the website. 

### The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the JEDEC website. On some pages, you can order publication subscriptions/ID Codes, contact JEDEC, register to download published JEDEC standards and documents free of charge, register to become a JEDEC member, or register to attend a JEDEC event. JEDEC collects the minimum amount of personal information necessary to fulfill these requests, and the type of information collected varies depending on the request. JEDEC does not retain credit card data collected for payment purposes.

JEDEC reserves the right to use cookies to identify single sessions, in which case a cookie will temporarily be written. This type of cookie is deleted as soon as you close your browser and is not stored permanently.

### The Way We Use Information

JEDEC reserves the right to compile, save, use within the scope of our activities, and analyze any and all data (contact and personal data, use history, etc.) that we collect from you through the Website. We use the personal information that you provide to us for our internal purposes such as responding to your requests for information, contacting you, conducting internal analyses, and processing and completing orders and event registrations.

Website users who register to download free documents and standards (“registrants”) have the opportunity to opt-in to the JEDEC email list. Registrants who opt-in may be added to our list of users who will receive promotional and marketing communications from us and our partners. Any partners with whom JEDEC shares the information of our opt-in registrants are contractually bound to use this information only to perform the services we have contracted with them to provide.

For new member registrations, JEDEC uses the contact information provided for each company representative to contact you on an ongoing basis with information about your assigned committees and subcommittees.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

### Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

### How You Can Access or Correct Your Information

Users who have registered to download JEDEC standards and documents may login to the site and visit "My Account" to review and manage their own personal profile.  Users experiencing difficulty should contact JEDEC for assistance.

JEDEC members may login to the protected members’ area, and may select to manage their profile from there. JEDEC members may also contact the JEDEC office for assistance with profile management. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
