# Privacy Policy | JetBlue

We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties, and we use it only in accordance with this policy.

We may use the information we collect about you (described above) for any purposes consistent with our statements under this privacy policy or as permitted by applicable law, including to complete transactions, respond to your requests, verify if a visitor meets any criteria in order to process a request, advertise, maintain and optimize the JetBlue Online Services, and notify you of promotions, updates or special offers, including JetBlue affiliate (like TrueBlue partner) offers, that we think may interest you. We also use your information to provide you with a more effective and personalized customer experience across all of our JetBlue Online Services and to serve you with advertisements and other information appropriate to you and your interests. We may also use your information off line to provide you services as well, including without limitation, customer service, in flight services, and booking services. For example, some of your information is collected so that when you visit a particular JetBlue Online Service more than once, the JetBlue Online Service will recognize you. We may also share the information we collect about you (including your Personal Information) with our parent, subsidiary or other affiliate entities without restriction.

JetBlue and our ad management companies will use your information, such as browsing and other online activities, to target advertising to you while you are using JetBlue Online Services or other online services that we think will be of interest to you. Some of this advertising may be designed to bring you back to our JetBlue Online Services. Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on the JetBlue Online Services and Third Party Services to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the JetBlue Online Services. 

For more information about your ad choices associated with this type of advertising and options to opt out, please visit this website from the Digital Advertising Alliance:

In order to accomplish all of those things, we may process your information or combine it with other information that we have about you or that is publicly available, and we also may share your information with other companies that are carefully selected by JetBlue to assist in these uses. Please see Could anyone other than JetBlue be collecting and using my information? below for information on how these other companies may collect and use your information.

To the extent permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose Personal Information to US or non-US government authorities or agencies or other third parties pursuant to a law, rule or regulation, legal request, subpoena, or other legal process or requirement.

We may also use or disclose your information (including to third party companies) to perform charge verifications, report or collect debts owed, fight fraud, or protect the rights or property of JetBlue, our customers, our third-party service providers, our affiliate companies, our JetBlue Online Services or its users.

If you would like your Personal Information removed from the JetBlue Online Services, please contact us at the email below, and we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your request by removing your information from our marketing databases.
