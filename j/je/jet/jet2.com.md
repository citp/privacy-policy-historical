## Where does your personal data come from?

**Essential Information**

Most of the data we process about you comes from you, for example, information you provide to us so that we can fulfil your travel booking.

Other information is gathered during your use of our websites (e.g. IP addresses or information obtained via cookies) and from your interaction with us at airports and hotels (e.g. data we may receive from airport check-in systems).

**Detailed Information**

A lot of the data we process is data which you provide to us, such as your name, contact details, payment card information, date of birth etc.  You usually provide this information when you make a booking via our websites or call centre, or when you contact us via email, letter or phone.

If you use social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, booking engines or personal banking sites, these sites are operated by third party providers and they may share your personal data with us.

**Cookies**

**Essential Information**

Similar to other commercial websites, our websites utilise a standard technology to collect information about how our website is used by individual computers connected to the internet.

This information is gathered through "Cookies". Cookies are small files of letters and numbers that we put on your computer's hard drive. These small files allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, monitor website traffic and to personalise the content of the site for you. This ultimately helps us provide you with a good experience when you browse our websites and improve the content of our marketing and allows us to improve our site going forward.

Please note however that Cookies cannot retrieve any personal data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. 

**Detailed Information**

To find out more about our use of cookies please read our cookies policy [here](https://www.jet2.com/cookies).

## Do you have to provide your personal data?

**Essential Information**

In most cases, providing your personal data to us is optional, however, if you do not provide it, we will probably not be able to fulfil your booking.  For example, if you book a flight with us, we need details such as your name and passport details to be able to complete your booking and we will need your payment card details to take your payment.  When you make a booking, we will only collect information which is required for the purpose of your booking.  In other cases, you have a choice over whether we collect your personal data, for example, you can turn off cookies on your browser and we will not place any cookies on your device or computer (although in this case you may not be able to use all parts of our website).  Sometimes, we are required by law to collect certain data for border control purposes and where you have booked a flight with us you cannot prevent this collection of data other than by choosing not to check-in for this flight.

## What are the legal grounds for processing your personal data?

**Essential Information**

Data protection laws require us to tell you what legal basis we use for processing your personal data.  These bases are set out in the applicable data protection law.  We generally use the following grounds:

  * the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you (i.e. the contract for the sale and purchase of your flight or holiday), or to take steps requested by you before entering into this contract;
  * the processing is in our or someone else's legitimate interests, and these interests are not overridden by your interests or rights in the protection of your personal data;
  * you have given your consent to the processing of your data; or
  * the processing is necessary to meet a legal obligation which applies to us.



Sometimes we process data about you which the law considers to fall within special categories (see section "What personal data do we process?" for more details), in which case, we use one of the following grounds:

  * the processing is necessary to protect your vital interests or those of another person where you are physically or legally incapable of giving consent (e.g. in the event of a medical emergency);
  * the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
  * the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of EU or domestic law; or
  * you have freely given your consent to the processing.



Please see the table below if you want to know which particular grounds we use for each particular processing activity.

## Who do we share your personal data with?

**Essential Information**

We share your personal data with third parties who provide services to us. 

In the course of doing so we may sometimes transfer data outside of the UK and when we do so we make sure that it is protected to the same standards as in the UK.

In relation to passengers making reservations to destinations in the United States of America we are required to transfer to the US Department of Homeland Security ( **"DHS"** ) certain travel and reservation data about passengers flying between the European Union and the United States of America in accordance with an International Agreement between the European Union and the United States. 

US authorities use this information for preventing and combating terrorism and other transnational serious crimes. For further information about the way in which the DHS uses this data please see : [www.dhs.gov](http://www.dhs.gov/) and this [PDF](https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_faq_pnr_cbp.pdf). Depending on the country you are travelling to we may also be required to share your information with other border agencies. 

**Detailed Information**

The types of third party service providers who we share your data with include companies which help us understand our customer behaviour or help improve our website, local airports and third party ground handlers who help provide services to you and our local partners in relation to package holidays.  We always have contracts in place with these third parties which require them to properly protect your data and only use it for the purposes of providing the particular service.

Where hotels which you stay in make decisions themselves about how to use your personal data they will be the data controller of that information and we would encourage you to read their privacy policy to understand how they handle your information and how to exercise your rights.

As part of providing your holiday we will engage local operators (for example, to arrange airport transfers) and we will share your personal data with them so they we can make sure your holiday runs smoothly.

If we sell or buy any business or assets, we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, and if we or part of our business is acquired by a third party, personal data about our customers will be transferred to that third party.

In the event of medical emergency during a flight we may share personal data with third party service providers to call for advice for the purposes of managing and recording passenger medical issues. Your personal data may also be included in a flight report which is sent to the flight operator. 

If you purchase car hire through **_Jet2holidays_** we will transfer your personal data to Rental Cars (Travel Jigsaw Limited) to provide you with car hire services. Jet2holidays and Rental Cars will be independent data controllers in respect of that information. Rental Cars will use the information in accordance with their privacy policy <https://www.jet2carhire.com/PrivacyPolicy.do>

We also share personal data for the purposes of fraud prevention and detection with other group companies and other organisations (including law enforcement agencies) involved in fraud prevention and detection. This includes sharing your details with a third party fraud management solution providers, in order to identify potentially fraudulent bookings. 

If there are any incidents with disruptive passengers on board our flights, we may share personal data with law enforcement agencies. We also share personal data relating to reported incidents, complaints and feedback in relation to **_Jet2holidays_** with our travel partners and local agents.

In order to assess and defend any legal claims made against us, we may share your personal data with our legal advisors and claims handlers. We may also share your information with law enforcement and government agencies where this is reasonable for the prevention and detection of crime or if we believe a claim is being made fraudulently.

We also pass your information to border agencies where this is required to travel to certain countries.

**Essential Information**

We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this Privacy Policy.

You have several rights in relation to your personal data. These include accessing your data, correcting any mistakes, having your data erased, restricting the processing of your data, objecting to the processing of your data, data portability, and rights relating to automated decision making and profiling. In most cases there are conditions attached to these rights. Please see the relevant sections below if you want to find out more.

To exercise your rights please contact our Data Protection Officer at: [privacy@jet2.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20190719235910id_/https%3A//www.jet2.com/privacy@jet2.com) or, to make a request to access your data, follow the instructions below.

**Detailed Information**

**Accessing your data**

You can ask us to confirm whether we are processing your personal data and to give you a copy of that data along with further information about how we use your personal data.

To make a request to access your data please send us your request in writing, signed and dated to the address below along with:

  * your full name and address;
  * a photocopy of your passport or driving licence, so that we can verify your identity; and
  * details of the personal data you require (along with any further details which may help us to identify you, such as dates and times of flights, destination and booking reference number if you know this).



If you are requesting a copy of personal data on behalf of a third party, please also send to us a signed authority from the individual whose data is required and a copy of their passport or driving licence. If the third party is a child under the age of 16, the written authority should come from a person with parental responsibility (along with a copy of the child’s passport).

Please send your request to: Data Protection Department, Legal Services, Jet2.com Limited, PO Box 284, Leeds, LS11 1GE or electronically to: [privacy@jet2.com](mailto:privacy@jet2.com).

You do not have to pay a fee for a copy of your information unless your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive, in which case we will charge a reasonable amount in the circumstances.  We will let you know of any charges before completing your request.

We aim to respond to you within 1 month of receiving your request unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we aim to respond within 3 months.  We will let you know if we are going to take longer than 1 month in dealing with your request.  If we have a lot of information about you we might ask you if you can tell us what exactly you want to receive.  This will help us action your request more quickly.

**Correcting your data**

You can ask us to correct any data which is inaccurate or incomplete.  This is free of charge.

We aim to deal with requests for correction within 1 month, although it might take us up to 3 months if your request is particularly complicated.

If we can't action a request to correct your data, we will let you know and explain why this is.

**Erasing your data**

This right is sometimes referred to as "the right to be forgotten".  This is not an absolute right but you have the right to have your data erased, free of charge, in certain circumstances. 

There are some exceptions to this right.  If one of these applies, we will confirm this to you and we do not have to delete the data.

**Restricting the processing of your data**

You can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in some circumstances, free of charge.  This is not an absolute right.  If processing is restricted we can store the data and retain enough information to make sure the restriction is respected, but we cannot further process your data.

We will tell you if we decide to lift a restriction on processing your data.

**Objecting to the processing of your data**

Objecting to the processing of your data is free of charge.  It is not an absolute right but you can object to our processing of your data where it is:

  * based on the legitimate interests ground; or
  * for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.



We will stop processing your personal data unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or unless we are processing the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

You can require us to stop using your data for direct marketing purposes.  We will process your request as soon as it is received but it may take up to 14 days for this to be effective.  There are no exemptions or reasons for us to refuse.

**Data Portability**

This allows you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services.  It applies where the following conditions are met:

you provided the personal data to us yourself;

  * we are processing the data either based on your consent or because it is necessary for the performance of a contract; and
  * the processing is carried out by automated means.



We will provide your data free of charge in a structured, commonly used and machine readable form.  We aim to provide your data within 1 month of receiving your request unless it is particularly complicated or you have made several requests, in which case we aim to respond within 3 months.  If we are going to take longer than 1 month we will let you know and explain why we need more time.  If we consider that we cannot provide you with your data, we will contact you and explain why this is.

**Contact and complaints**

If you have any questions about this policy or about how we use your personal data please contact the Data Protection Officer at: [privacy@jet2.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20190719235910id_/https%3A//www.jet2.com/privacy@jet2.com).
