        <style>p{margin:10px 0px;line-height:16px;}</style><div><h1 class="pageHeading">Privacy Notice</h1></div><br>We are dedicated to ensuring that your online shopping experience is secure and private.  All of the credit card information we receive from our customers is transmitted and encrypted through SSL to our credit card processing gateway.  Customer information is used for shipping, payment and contact purposes only.  We do not sell, give away, or abuse the information we receive.  Jet-Do would not approve of such things!
<br><br>
This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting
JetPens, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy
Notice.
<br><br>
What Personal Information About Customers Does JetPens Gather?
<br><br>
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and
continually improve your shopping experience at JetPens. Here are the
types of information we gather.
<br><br>
   * Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information
you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose
not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to
take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that
you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests,
customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and
communicating with you.<br>
   * Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of
information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web
sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information
when your Web browser accesses JetPens. A number of companies offer
utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although
we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at
JetPens if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these
tools exist.<br>
   * E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and
interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from
JetPens if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare
our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort
to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not
want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your
Customer Communication Preferences.<br>
   * Newletters: We send newsletters to users who select to receive them. Should you at any point change your mind about receiving these communications, please select the unsubscribe link which is present at the bottom of each email we send to remove yourself from the list.<br>
   * Information from Other Sources: We might receive information
about you from other sources and add it to our account information.
<br><br>
What About Cookies?
<br><br>
   * Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems
to recognize your browser and to provide features such as storage of
items in your Shopping Cart between visits.<br>
   * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you
how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have
the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full
advantage of some of JetPens's coolest features, and we recommend that
you leave them turned on.<br>
<br><br>
Does JetPens Share the Information It Receives?
<br><br>
Information about our customers is an important part of our business,
and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share
customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries
PCOW, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or
follow practices at least as protective as those described in this
Privacy Notice.
<br><br>
   * Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform
functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders,
delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing
repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing
marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including
paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and
providing customer service. They have access to personal information
needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other
purposes.<br>
   * Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups
of JetPens customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this,
we do not give that business your name and address.<br>
   * Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we
might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such
transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any
pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents
otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that PCOW, Inc., or
substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
will of course be one of the transferred assets.<br>
   * Protection of JetPens and Others: We release account and other
personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply
with the law; enforce or apply other agreements; or protect the
rights, property, or safety of JetPens, our users, or others. This
includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however,
this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise
disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for
commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this
Privacy Notice.<br>
   * With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive
notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you
will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
<br><br>
How Secure Is Information About Me?
<br><br>
   * We work to protect the security of your information during
transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which
encrypts information you input.<br>
   * We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers
when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit
card number to the appropriate credit card company during order
processing.<br>
   * It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access
to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when
finished using a shared computer.
<br><br>
Which Information Can I Access?
<br><br>
JetPens gives you access to a broad range of information about your
account and your interactions with JetPens for the limited purpose of
viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
<br><br>
What Choices Do I Have?
<br><br>
   * As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide
information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to
take advantage of such JetPens features as Your Profile, Wish Lists,
and Customer Reviews.<br>
   * You can add or update certain information on pages such as those
listed in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section above. When
you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version
for our records.<br>
   * If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us,
please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences. (If you do not
want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from us,
such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use
of JetPens, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)<br>
   * The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you
how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have
the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to use
important features if you do not use cookies.
<br><br>
Children
<br><br>
JetPens does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell
children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you
may use JetPens only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
<br><br>

Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions
<br><br>
If you choose to visit JetPens, your visit and any dispute over
privacy is subject to this Notice, including limitations on damages,
arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of
California. If you have any concern about privacy at JetPens, please
contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it.
<br><br>
Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice will change
also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions,
unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web
site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our
current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about
you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however,
and will never materially change our policies and practices to make
them less protective of customer information collected in the past
without the consent of affected customers.
