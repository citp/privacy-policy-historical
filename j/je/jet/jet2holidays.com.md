In the course of doing so we may sometimes transfer data outside of the UK and when we do so we make sure that it is protected to the same standards as in the UK.

In relation to passengers making reservations to destinations in the United States of America we are required to transfer to the US Department of Homeland Security ( **"DHS"** ) certain travel and reservation data about passengers flying between the European Union and the United States of America in accordance with an International Agreement between the European Union and the United States. 

US authorities use this information for preventing and combating terrorism and other transnational serious crimes. For further information about the way in which the DHS uses this data please see : [www.dhs.gov](http://www.dhs.gov/) and this [PDF](https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_faq_pnr_cbp.pdf). Depending on the country you are travelling to we may also be required to share your information with other border agencies. 

**Detailed Information**

**** The types of third party service providers who we share your data with include companies which help us understand our customer behaviour or help improve our website, local airports and third party ground handlers who help provide services to you and our local partners in relation to package holidays.  We always have contracts in place with these third parties which require them to properly protect your data and only use it for the purposes of providing the particular service.

Where hotels which you stay in make decisions themselves about how to use your personal data they will be the data controller of that information and we would encourage you to read their privacy policy to understand how they handle your information and how to exercise your rights.

As part of providing your holiday we will engage local operators (for example, to arrange airport transfers) and we will share your personal data with them so they we can make sure your holiday runs smoothly.

If we sell or buy any business or assets, we will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets, and if we or part of our business is acquired by a third party, personal data about our customers will be transferred to that third party.

In the event of medical emergency during a flight we may share personal data with third party service providers to call for advice for the purposes of managing and recording passenger medical issues. Your personal data may also be included in a flight report which is sent to the flight operator. 

We also share personal data for the purposes of fraud prevention and detection with other group companies and other organisations (including law enforcement agencies) involved in fraud prevention and detection. This includes sharing your details with a third party fraud management solution providers, in order to identify potentially fraudulent bookings.

If there are any incidents with disruptive passengers on board our flights, we may share personal data with law enforcement agencies. We also share personal data relating to reported incidents, complaints and feedback in relation to **_Jet2holidays_** with our travel partners and local agents.

In order to assess and defend any legal claims made against us, we may share your personal data with our legal advisors and claims handlers. We may also share your information with law enforcement and government agencies where this is reasonable for the prevention and detection of crime or if we believe a claim is being made fraudulently.

We also pass your information to border agencies where this is required to travel to certain countries.

#### How long do we keep your personal data for?

We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this Privacy Policy. In some cases we may store your personal information for longer periods of time where we need to maintain an accurate record of your dealings with us to help manage complaints or claims you or others may raise, or otherwise comply with legal or regulatory requirements. If you would like to know more about how long we retain information please contact us.

You have several rights in relation to your personal data. These include accessing your data, correcting any mistakes, having your data erased, restricting the processing of your data, objecting to the processing of your data, data portability, and rights relating to automated decision making and profiling.
