                      <p> By using jetblue.com, your information and site activity data is collected.  When you register with JetBlue's TrueBlue Customer Appreciation program online;  book travel on jetblue.com, jetblue.com/getaways, or jetblue.com/companyblue; purchase merchandise through our website; or sign up for a sweepstakes or other promotional activity over our website, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information such as your name, home address, e-mail address, and telephone number(s).  When you use the online ticketing portion of our site, which is run by our ticketing agent, Navitaire, Inc. or the Getaways portion of our site, which is run by our business partner EzRez Software, Inc., you will also be asked to provide your travel details. If you book travel, purchase something from our online store, or purchase in-flight movies through our LiveTV system, you will also be asked to provide your credit card number and billing information. </p>
                      <p>By using jetblue.com, some information may be automatically collected by our web servers as you browse our site. For example, our web server automatically collects information known as "clickstream data," such as the domain name of the site providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our site, pages viewed, information searched for, access times and other relevant statistics.  If you would like to remove yourself from these tracking and reporting functions performed for this Website, please visit the Omniture opt-out page at <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/2o7" target="_blank">http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/2o7</a> and follow the instructions.  We also collect information by using technologies and methodologies that enable tracking, such as "cookies."  "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website transfers to the hard drive of a visitor's computer for record-keeping purposes. "Cookies" provide visitors a personalized experience on our site by enabling us to determine unique preferences and trends based on visits to our website and to other websites.</p>
                      <p>JetBlue collects Internet browser tracking data through other technologies and methodologies that help manage online advertising.

                      <strong>How do we use the personal information we collect?</strong>
                      </p>
                      <p> We do not sell your information and we use it only in accordance with this policy.  We use the information to complete transactions, respond to your requests and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. We also use your information to provide you with a more effective customer experience at jetblue.com and with JetBlue.  In order to do this, we may process your information or combine it with other information that we have about you or that is publicly available.  This enables us to customize your JetBlue experience and provide you with more relevant offers.  To do these things, we may share your information with our carefully selected business partners who agree to appropriate confidentiality and security measures and who are bound to follow terms at least as restrictive as this privacy policy in handling your information. </p>
                      <p> We use information collected from our web-servers and from site tracking to enable us to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our site and to better tailor our site to our visitors' needs.  For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit our site again, the site will recognize you, and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to you and your interests.  We also use this information to verify that visitors to our site meet the criteria required to process their requests. </p>
                      <p> As described above, some of this information is collected through the use of "cookies".  Most browsers used by visitors have options that allow the visitor to control whether the browser will accept "cookies", reject "cookies", or notify the visitor each time a "cookie" is sent, but setting a browser to reject "cookies" will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our site.  Please be aware that rejecting or disabling "cookies" will not necessarily limit all forms of site tracking technologies and methodologies. </p>
                      <p> To the extent permitted by law, we may disclose personally identifiable information to government authorities or third parties pursuant to a legal request, subpoena, or other legal process.

                      <p> We take reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use and we periodically review our security measures.  When you voluntarily provide us with information while registering or booking a reservation, such as your name, address, phone number, credit card information, and travel details, your information is encrypted and transferred over a secure connection, available on browsers such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. The padlock icon found in most browsers will appear locked and the first characters of the website address will change from "http" to "https" if you are accessing a secure server. Do not use e-mail to send us credit card, billing or other personally identifiable information as e-mail travels unencrypted and can be read by anyone who receives or intercepts it.  Once your information reaches us, we store it behind a secure firewall that blocks access to the information from outside of our network.  Only JetBlue-authorized individuals are allowed to access your information. </p>

                      </p>
                      <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires you to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender for the purpose of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 and 49 C.F.R parts 1540 and 1560. You may also provide your Redress Number, if available. Failure to provide your full name, date of birth, and gender may result in denial of transport or denial of authority to enter the boarding area.

                      <strong>Note to users in European Union and other countries with data protection laws:</strong>
                      </p>
                      <p> JetBlue is committed to protecting personal data to the fullest extent of its Privacy Policy, which appears below.  Because JetBlue is based in the U.S. with many flights in or to the U.S., this policy is consistent with U.S. law and practice.  JetBlue does not fly routes within Europe, so this Privacy Policy is not adapted to European laws. </p>
                      <p> By agreeing to JetBlue's Privacy Policy, you consent to JetBlue applying its Privacy Policy in place of data protections under your country's law.  That is, you freely and unambiguously consent that: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Terms of this Privacy Policy, not your home country's laws, control how JetBlue will process personal data about you </li>
                        <li>Data you enter on this website, and other data connected with your flight, will be transmitted to and processed in the U.S., a jurisdiction whose laws do not offer data protections equivalent to your home country's </li>
                        <li>Sensitive data, such as data involving your health, will also be processed consistent with the policy below and transmitted to/processed in the U.S., a jurisdiction without equivalent data protections </li>
                        <li>JetBlue processes data complying with all applicable laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions where it flies; this means JetBlue complies with laws requiring it to provide passenger data to government agencies</li>
                      </ul>
