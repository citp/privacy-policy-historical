            <p>JetAudio, Inc. (JetAudio) is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of consumers of its  interactive products and services. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute  to providing a safe and secure environment for consumers. The purpose of this jetaudio.com  privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to jetaudio.com, what  kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit jetaudio.com, 
how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the  choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the  information. <br>
<br>
Other JetAudio products and services may also have their own privacy policies, which  you should review when you use these services. Finally, please note that this  policy applies only to jetaudio.com, and not to other companies' or  organizations' Web sites to which we link. <br>
              <br>
              </p>
              <p><span class="sub_title"><font color="#FF9900">Information About All jetaudio.com Visitors </font></span></p>
            <p>In general, our site  automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency  of visitors to jetaudio.com and its areas, very much like television ratings  that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such  data in the aggregate. <br>
              <br>
This aggregate data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the  site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can  make it for as many of you as possible. For example, jetaudio.com uses a  technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in  our site are visited, and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we 
do not combine information collected through these cookies with other  personally identifiable information
to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We  also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information  about you personally, to our jetaudio.com partners about how our members,  collectively, use jetaudio.com. We do this so they too can understand how much  people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the  best possible Web experience as well. <br>
<br>
Finally, jetaudio.com, its advertisers and ad servers may also use cookies, as  well as small pieces of code called "web beacons" or "clear  gifs," to determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements and  promotions users have seen and how users responded to them, but do not use  these technologies to 
collect personally identifiable information unless you give us permission to do  so. <br>
              <br>
              </p>
              <p><span class="sub_title"><font color="#FF9900">Information About You </font></span></p>
            <p>If you are an jetaudio.com member, when  you access jetaudio.com you may obtain access to features of 
the jetaudio.com service that contain personal information. <br>
<br>
Additionally, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign  up to use a service or when you order a product. We will need certain  information -- such as name, Internet address or screen name, billing address,  type of computer, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or  product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional  products and services about which you might be interested. You can choose not  to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the  registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you  for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage  of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond  or not.<br>
                <br>
              </p>
              <p><span class="sub_title"><font color="#FF9900">Disclosure </font></span></p>
            <p>We do not use or disclose information  about your individual visits to jetaudio.com or information that you may give  us on jetaudio.com, such as your name, address, email address or telephone  number, to any outside companies. jetaudio.com may share such information in  response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or in special  cases such as a physical threat to you or others. <br>
              <br>
And, as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated  statistical "ratings" information about the use of jetaudio.com. <br>
