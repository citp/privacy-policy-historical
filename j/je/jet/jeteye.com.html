We also reserve the right to set up procedures that allow individual users, at their own discretion, to do the same.</p>
<p>Registered users have the ability to designate Jetpaks as Public or Private and Site visitors may view, rate, share, search for and post Commentary about Public Jetpaks. The tags you assign Jetpaks will determine when they show up in search queries performed by Site visitors.

Jeteye reserves the right to modify the tags, title and description for any Public Jetpak.</p>

Jeteye does not limit the number of times or the number of people to whom this link can subsequently be forwarded.</p>
