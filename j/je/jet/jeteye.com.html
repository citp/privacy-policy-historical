Jeteye reserves the right in its sole discretion to access, store and disclose Content from your Jetpak, any comments or editorial content ("Commentary") posted by you or any other visitor on the Site or user registration information if Jeteye believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce the <a href="/about/policy/terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a>, this Privacy Policy or our <a href="/about/policy/copyright.html">Copyright Policy</a>, comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations, operate its systems properly, or protect the rights or property of Jeteye, its users, visitors or others.</p>

We also reserve the right to set up procedures that allow individual users, at their own discretion, to do the same.</p>
<p>Registered users have the ability to designate Jetpaks as Public or Private and Site visitors may view, rate, share, search for and post Commentary about Public Jetpaks. The tags you assign Jetpaks will determine when they show up in search queries performed by Site visitors. Jeteye reserves the right to review all Jetpaks posted on the Site to ensure that they have accurate and appropriate tags, title and description. Jeteye reserves the right to modify the tags, title and description for any Public Jetpak.</p>

Jeteye does not limit the number of times or the number of people to whom this link can subsequently be forwarded.</p>
<p>When posting a Public Jetpak, remember that any information you disclose becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal, financial or other information.</p>
