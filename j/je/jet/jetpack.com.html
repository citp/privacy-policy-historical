<h3>Jetpack Digital, LLC ("Jetpack") Privacy Policy and your Ad Preferences</h3>
<p>Jetpack is an online service delivering ads to websites across the world and web for brands and advertisers.  You can find out more about Jetpack’s suite of services by visiting <a href="http://www.jetpack.com">http://www.jetpack.com</a></p>

<p>Jetpack and the advertisers we work with are fully committed to preserving the privacy of internet users who see advertisements delivered by Jetpack. Never during an ad campaign does Jetpack collect any personally identifying information about the internet user.</p>

<h3>For Visitors to the Jetpack Web site (the "site")</h3>

<p>Jetpack collects aggregate and Non-Personal Information that is generated automatically as a user navigates through the www.Jetpack.com Site. For example, we collect information about how many times a particular page within our Site is visited and which features of the Site users interact with. This information does not identify an individual, but tells us how many users visited the Site and used its features. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor the Site to our visitors. Jetpack may collect Non-Personal Information of users through a variety of technologies and practices including Jetpack’s browser cookies, web beacons or similar technologies, or a third party’s browser cookies. A cookie is a small file that can be automatically stored on a computer when the computer’s browser views an advertisements or a website.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Jetpack uses several different cookies for different purposes on this Site. We use our own cookies, also known as “first party” cookies, for various purposes, including analyzing our servers’ interactions with your browser and for our own marketing purposes in marketing Jetpack’s ad development and serving services to our customers.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Jetpack currently sets cookies to be effective for no more than one year from the last interaction with a Jetpack domain or an Ad served by Jetpack. If you have concerns about historical cookies, we recommend that you clear your cookies using your web browser’s settings.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>In addition to our own cookies, we also use a limited number of third-party cookies, which we use for site analytics that allow us to improve this Site and to enable social media sharing, site bookmarking, video functionality, measurements, tracking and re-targeting. Jetpack does not create these cookies, which collect technical information about computers visiting this Site, and these third-party cookies remain active for a period set by the third party entity with which they originate. Please read <a href="#optout">below</a> for more information regarding our use of cookies with Jetpack Ads.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>In addition, Jetpack may collect information (including Personal Information, such as email addresses) that users supply voluntarily on the Site, such as when a user signs up for electronic newsletters or other email from Jetpack. If you do not consent to this collection of your Personal Information and its use as described in this policy, do not provide any Personal Information on this Site.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Jetpack may use any information submitted on the Site by a user for the purpose for which the information was submitted and for its other purposes, including to understand how users interact with the Site, to contact the user for customer service purposes, to inform the user of important changes or additions to the Site or the services offered by the Site, and to send the user administrative notices and any other communications that Jetpack believes may be of interest to the user.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>If you have subscribed to one or more of our email newsletters, you also may change your subscriber information, modify your subscriptions, and/or unsubscribe from these communications at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email you receive.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>The Site may include links to other websites. Those websites will have their own privacy policies that you may wish to review. Jetpack has no responsibility for these linked websites.</p>


<h3>Advertising Served Through Jetpack and Jetpack Ad Delivery</h3>

<h3>Advertising Cookies and equivalent technology</h3>
<p>Jetpack adheres to all applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Jetpack respects the privacy of all Internet users, including individuals who visit the Site and individuals who view Jetpack Ads.</p>
<p>Jetpack may collect and store Non-Personal Information (including, but not limited to browser type, IP address, operating system and the date and time of requests made to our ad server) that is generated automatically as a Viewer sees and interacts with Jetpack Ads. At the request of Advertisers or Publishers, Jetpack may also assist in the collection of Non-Personal Information of viewers by third parties conducting research.</p>

<p>In certain cases, at the request of an Advertiser or Publisher, a Jetpack Ad may be designed to enable the collection of data such as town of residence, zip code, or gender, as well as personal information such as your email address. If you do not consent to collection of your Personal Information, do not supply any Personal Information in a Jetpack Ad. Any Personal Information about a Viewer that is collected by a Jetpack Ad is provided to the Advertiser or Publisher or its authorized service provider and is not used or retained by Jetpack for any other purpose. The Advertiser or Publisher's collection and use of the Personal Information of Viewers is defined by the Advertiser or Publisher's privacy policy. Jetpack is not responsible for Advertisers' or Publishers' privacy or information practices.</p>

<p>In some cases, information that is voluntarily supplied by users within a Jetpack Ad in connection with certain third-party services is provided to the third party. The third party's collection and use of the information of Viewers is defined by that third party's privacy policy. Jetpack is not responsible for the third party's privacy or information practices.</p>

<p>Jetpack may use Non-Personal Information of Viewers collected within Jetpack Ads to better target advertisements, improve the user experience, including to better direct Jetpack Ads to specific types of visitors, and/or to measure ad effectiveness. We may share non-PII in our Advertiser or Publisher Reports, however, we do not otherwise sell or share any user-level data.</p>

<p><em>Jetpack may collect Non-Personal Information of Viewers through a variety of technologies and practices including Jetpack's or other third party's browser cookies or similar technologies. A cookie is a small file that can be automatically stored on a computer when the computer's browser views an advertisements or a website. For example, Jetpack may use cookies to collect Non-Personal Information, such as the approximate geographic location of the Viewer based on their IP address,  and any Jetpack Ads that the Viewer has viewed or on which the Viewer has clicked.</em></p>
<p> Jetpack also utilize HTML5 local storage for mobile and table campaigns, solely to report attributed ads to conversions. Jetpack do not use HTML5 local storage for any form of ad targeting.

</p><p>Jetpack does not collect or use any sensitive data for advertising purposes, including social security numbers or other government issued identifiers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, sexual orientation, or precise information about past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions. We do not target any ads on health-related topics.</p>

<p>The security of your information is very important to us. All information we gather is stored on secure servers and our internal systems. However, as effective as the reasonable security measures implemented by us may be, no physical or electronic security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our Site's servers or databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. You play a role in protecting your information as well.</p>

<p>Jetpack does not knowingly collect any information from a child under 13.

<a name="optout"></a>
</p><p>Jetpack may share the information collected in a Jetpack Ad with the Advertiser. For example, if a user has opted in to receive email marketing from the Advertiser, Jetpack will share information collected in the Advertiser's Jetpack Ad with that Advertiser. Jetpack may occasionally release information that Jetpack collects from Jetpack Ads in order to comply with law, or to protect the rights, property or safety of advertisers, publishers, users, the public or Jetpack. Also, in the event that Jetpack sells some or all of its assets, or Jetpack is acquired by another company, information that Jetpack collects may be among the transferred assets.</p>

<h3>Opt-Out</h3>
<p>Although Jetpack does not currently target Jetpack ads based on any known Personally Identifiable Information (PII),  a Viewer can Opt Out of receiving cookies that enable the Viewer's browser to receive targeted Jetpack ads by clicking on the Opt-Out image below.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>If a Viewer changes his or her mind after opting out (because he or she decides receiving tailored advertising is preferable to receiving generic ads), the Viewer can opt in by clicking the Opt-In link below.</p>

<p>This Opt-Out process provides a Jetpack opt-out cookie to the user's browser. Therefore, if cookies are disabled, erased, or altered, or browser and/or machine software is changed, then the results of this opt-out process may be undone, and the Opt-Out will need to be performed again.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the Viewer's web browser may allow a user to disable cookies. To disable cookies using Internet Explorer, select "Internet Options" under the Tools menu and click on "Privacy." Select "High" or "Block All Cookies." To disable cookies using Mozilla Firefox, select "Options" under the "Tools" menu. To check your cookie setting on Safari, select "Preferences" from the Safari menu, and then select either "Privacy" (versions 5.1 and later) or "Security" (versions 5.0.x and earlier). Jetpack does not use Flash Cookies but Adobe's Flash Player Settings Manager allows you to customize the websites which you allow to use local storage ("Flash Cookies"). If a user chooses to disable cookies, a user may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Jetpack Ads.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Depending on the Viewer's individual browser settings, some anti-spyware software programs may erroneously flag Jetpack advertisements or cookies as computer threats.

						<h4>Co-founder, Chief Technology Officer</h4>
						<p>As co-founder and CTO, Kevin Woolery is responsible for technical vision and the implementation and maintenance of the Jetpack platform.</p>
						<p>An avid technologist and entrepreneur, Kevin began writing code at age nine and his software has since contributed to several high-profile entertainment, infrastructure and publishing systems. He began his career in computer switch maintenance for the U.S. Air Force and soon went on to create a virtual reality racing simulation as a network engineer at Illusion, Inc. and later would help transform the legacy software systems of the Screen Actors Guild as a senior software engineer.

Prior to Jetpack, Kevin was co-founder and chief architect at BUZZMEDIA, where he created products that became Web 2.0 standards and transformed a single social media site into a large network of managed content and advertising experiences.</p>
						<p>Outside of work, Kevin enjoys running and he recently completed his third marathon. He has a lifelong love of reading and learning, with a wide range of interests including physics, electronics, computer vision, robotics, biology and literature. He loves to travel and has been known to dabble in stand-up comedy. He has two children, Courtney and Kyle, and current lives in Marina del Rey, Calif., with his wife, Heidi, and their dachshund-Chihuahua, Lola.

						<h2>Frida</h2>
						<h4>Office Dog</h4>
						<p>Frida is a Mexican Hairless dog. She comes to the office to nap in the sun and guard the front door.</p>
						<p>The Mexican Hairless, a.k.a. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Hairless_Dog" target="_blank">Xoloitzcuintli</a> (“sho-low-eets-queen-tlee”) is the oldest dog breed in North America. The hairlessness comes from a spontaneous natural mutation that happened over 2000 years ago. The breed was revered as a sacred healing dog of the Aztecs, Toletcs, and Maya.</p>
						<p>Frida was named after the famous artist Frida Kahlo who also owned and painted this ancient breed of dog. (More on Xolos.)</p>
