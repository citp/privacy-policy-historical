Jetpack Digital, LLC ("Jetpack") Privacy Policy
<br><br>
Jetpack Digital, LLC ("Jetpack") takes seriously the interest of its advertisers, publishers and users in how information is collected and used. Below is Jetpack's policy on collecting, using, disclosing, maintaining, and protecting the information that it receives through Jetpack-powered advertisements or through its World Wide Web site (the "Site").
<br><br>
<b>Data Collection from Site</b><br>
Jetpack does not collect information that is generated automatically as a user navigates through this website (the "Site"). However, Jetpack may collect and store information (including personally identifiable information, such as email addresses) that users supply voluntarily on the Site, for example when signing up for electronic newsletters or requesting information from Jetpack.
<br><br>
Jetpack may use any information submitted on the Site by a user for the purpose for which the information was submitted and any purpose related to the Site, including to contact the user for customer service purposes, to inform the user of important changes or additions to the Site or the services offered by the Site and to send the user administrative notices and any other communications that Jetpack believes may be of interest to the user.
<br><br>
Any password-protected areas of the Site can be accessed only with a valid password. Each password owner is responsible for keeping the password secret and confidential, and for notifying Jetpack if the password may have been stolen or might otherwise be misused.
<br><br>
If a visitor has elected to receive from Jetpack product updates, new product information, newsletters, or other marketing information, and would like to discontinue receiving these materials, send an email to ads@jetpack.com with “privacy policy opt-out” in the subject line. Users should request the opt-out option.
<br><br>
<b> Data Collection of Information Received through Jetpack-powered Advertisements </b><br>
Jetpack does not collect personally identifiable information such as name, address, phone number, or email address. However, Jetpack does collect certain non-personally identifiable information about users, such as the server into which a computer is logged, whether and how a user responded to the advertisement delivered, the type of computer operating system used, and browser type. The non-personally identifiable information that is collected is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of advertisers and Web publishers.
<br><br>
When an Jetpack-powered advertisement is received on a computer or other electronic device, Jetpack utilizes techniques to determine whether that device has previously received the advertisement, as well as techniques to evaluate the user's interaction with the advertisement (including any information voluntarily provided by the user in surveys or otherwise). Such information is used to avoid sending repetitive advertising to the user, to customize subsequent advertising to enhance the user's experience, to comport with the user's habits or preferences, and sometimes to measure the effectiveness of the advertisement.
<br><br>
From time to time, advertisers, publishers or portals request that Jetpack  assist in the collection of information voluntarily supplied by users in connection with an Jetpack-powered advertisement, or a user's interaction with such an advertisement, which may include personal information such as name, address, phone number, or email address. This information is provided directly to the advertiser, publisher, network, and/or portal, and is not used independently by Jetpack. Jetpack is not responsible for the advertisers' use of this voluntarily supplied information and Jetpack is informed that this information is to be used by the advertiser, publisher, network, and/or portal, in accordance with their own particular privacy policy. However, Jetpack cannot control the use of such information by any such advertiser, publisher, network and/or portal, and is not responsible for their use of such information.
<br><br>
Additionally information (including personally identifying information) supplied by users for use by a third party's services (such as that provided for SMS services) is provided directly to the third party, and is not stored by either Jetpack or the publisher's site on which the advertisement is displayed. This information is used solely for the purpose that is identified by the third party within the advertisement in which the data is being supplied or as established within that third party's privacy policy.
<br><br>
Jetpack may occasionally disclose information that it collects if required to do so by law or in the good–faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and/or federal laws or to respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, warrant, or legal process in the manner required by the requesting entity.
<br><br>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
As most Internet sites do, Jetpack may use "cookies" or "scripts" to enhance a user's experience on the Internet. A cookie is a piece of text stored by a user's web browser and contains a unique number that is assigned to a browser the first time an Jetpack-powered advertisement is served. This number is stored on the user's computer and helps deliver advertisements which are not repetitive and may be more relevant to the user. This number cannot be transferred to another browser, cannot be related to a specific person, and does not contain viruses. Additionally cookies may collect any of the non-personally identifiable information described above.
<br><br>
Some Internet browsers can be adjusted to disable the use of cookies and scripts; however, some functionalities of an Jetpack-powered advertisement or the Site may not be available without the use of cookies and scripts.
<br><br>
Jetpack sets cookies to expire after one year and additional cookies are set every time a user encounters the Jetpack server.
<br><br>
<b>Other Web Sites</b><br>
This privacy statement applies solely to Jetpack's technology and Site. Jetpack is not responsible for the privacy practices of advertisers, publishers, networks, portals, or other sites to which the Site may link.
<br><br>
<b>Updates and Questions</b><br>
Changes in Jetpack's Privacy Policy may occur at any time. Such changes will be communicated by publishing the modified Privacy Policy on the Site. Please be sure to check for updates. While changes may be made to the Privacy Policy, Jetpack will not use personally identifiable information for any new purposes without user consent.
