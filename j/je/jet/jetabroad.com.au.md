##  Accessing your information

You may at any time access and change your personal information or subscribed services, either on our website, or by sending an email to [customersupport@jetabroad.com](mailto:customersupport@jetabroad.com).

##  Minors

As we cannot distinguish the age of persons who access our site, a blanket privacy policy is applied. Jetabroad does not intend nor does it seek to receive any personal information from minors. Should a parent or guardian have reason to believe that a minor has provided Jetabroad with personal information without their prior consent, please contact us to ensure that the information is removed from our database.

Jetabroad uses technology and security features to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. A secure server protects your personal information. In addition, you may complete bookings with Jetabroad using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. If you become aware of any security breach, please let us know as soon as possible.

Procedures and training ensure that Jetabroad staff continuously respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by Jetabroad.

Jetabroad will make best endeavours to keep any information which we hold about you secure. As the Internet data transmission cannot be guaranteed to be 100%, we cannot be responsible for any event arising from unauthorised access to your personal information. Jetabroad will not be held responsible for events arising from third parties gaining unauthorised access to your personal information.

Please note also that Jetabroad may use overseas facilities to process or back up its information. As a result, we may transfer and store your personal information to our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your privacy.
