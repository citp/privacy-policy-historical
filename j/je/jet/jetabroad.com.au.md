### Why does Jetabroad collect personal information?

The information we collect is for the purposes of Jetabroad and our business partners providing travel and related services to you and to offer you travel-related products and services that may be of interest to you. You are entitled to access the information Jetabroad holds about you by contacting the privacy officer whose details are provided below. Furthermore, If at any time you have any concerns or complaints in relation to privacy, please contact the privacy officer.

When we book products and services for you, we do so as an agent on behalf of travel service providers. This means that we collect personal information about you both for our internal purposes (e.g. to process your booking and to manage post sale changes), and on behalf of the parties for whom we act as agent, for their internal purposes (e.g. for an airline to process an eticket). In order to provide the travel and related services to you we will disclose only the information required by the service provider so that they may provide the service to you.

**We collect the personal information for the following reasons:**

  1. To identify you when you use our site, and in order to customise your Jetabroad experience
  2. For payment security purposes (identification of fraud or error)
  3. To enable us to process your booking requests and purchases
  4. To send you confirmation emails, and advise you of any changes that might occur to your reservation
  5. For our staff to contact you, where necessary
  6. Where applicable, to send you updates and/or newsletters that are relevant to the service we have provided you
  7. To send you information about our products and services, that are related to the service we have provided to you
  8. For example, we may collect details such as your name, residential address, mailing address, telephone number, email address, credit/debit card details (including card type, card number, security number and expiry date), passport details, frequent flyer details, information about your dietary requirements, and other details relevant to your travel arrangements or required by the relevant travel service providers.

We will only collect sensitive information about you with your consent and where reasonably necessary for the purpose of organising and booking your travel.



With your express consent Jetabroad may also share your details with business partners for the purpose of sharing offers of their travel related products and services that may be of interest to you.

By providing personal information to us (or allowing another person to do so on your behalf), you agree that this Policy will apply to how we handle your personal information and you consent to us collecting, using and disclosing your personal information as detailed in this Policy.

When booking a flight on our site Jetabroad ensures your credit card information is transmitted over secure lines. We use a mechanism to transfer sensitive data over the Internet called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). SSL is a protocol that provides communications privacy, authentication and message integrity and prevents eavesdropping, tampering or message forgery by encrypting data.

We may collect personal information about you when you enter competitions, when you register for promotions, when you subscribe to receive marketing from us (e.g. newsletters). We may also collect your personal information when you complete surveys or provide us with feedback. We will only send newsletters or other promotional materials to you if you have opted in to receive them. If you wish to stop receiving these emails, please click here to unsubscribe.

  * to comply with our legal obligations and any applicable customs/immigration requirements relating to your travel;
  * to comply with a request from a qualified government department if we are satisfied that they have the authority to make such request;
  * where we suspect that unlawful activity has been or may be engaged in and the personal information is a necessary part of our investigation or reporting of the matter;
  * as permitted or required by law
  * to various regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials and agencies, including to protect against fraud and for related security purposes;
