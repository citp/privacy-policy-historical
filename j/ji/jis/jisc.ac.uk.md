# Privacy statement : JISC

JISC takes the privacy of your information very seriously. By using our website, you will be deemed to have consented to the collection and use of the personal information that you provide in the ways described below. 

**Usage statistics and tracking**

The website gathers information that may be aggregated to provide statistics on the way in which the usage of the site relates to user preferences. Information gathered may also be used to automatically tailor certain elements of the site to reflect an individual’s mode of use. This data relates only to an abstract identification code and cannot be linked to any particular person or persons. 

**Online order forms and events forms**

Across the website, web forms are used so you can, for instance, order publications, register for JISC-related events or participate in evaluations and surveys. On each form, a Collection Notice gives information about how your details will be used for that specific purpose in accordance with the Data Protection Act (1998). 

**Mailing lists**

Some areas of JISC work are supported by discussion lists and forums. This service is provided by a JISC-funded service JISCmail. Full information about conditions and use of the lists is available on the [JISCmail website](http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/).
