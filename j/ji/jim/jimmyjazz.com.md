We maintain reasonable safeguards to keep your Personal Information secure. When we provide Personal Information to our affiliates or third party service providers as discussed in this Privacy Policy, we require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy and in a manner that complies with applicable privacy laws.

We may disclose your Personal Information for any purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information. We may also disclosure your Personal Information with your permission or as directed by you. 

**Security**

Although we may provide certain encryption technologies and use other reasonable precautions to protect your confidential information and provide suitable security, we do not and cannot guarantee or warrant that any information transmitted through the Internet is secure, or that such transmissions are free from delay, interruption, interception or error.

The federal government and technology industry have developed practical tips (available at [www.onguardonline.gov/](http://www.onguardonline.gov/)) to help you guard against Internet fraud, secure your computer and protect your personal information.

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for the "Verified and Secured" badge located in the website footer, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page. 

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. 

**Data Retention**

We will retain and use your Personal Information for as long as is needed for us to be able to provide our products and services to you, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, comply with our internal business practices and standards, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Personal Information is destroyed when it is no longer necessary for these purposes. Our business partners and third-party service providers may have their own data retention policies.

**Information from Children**

The Website is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of thirteen (13). You affirm that you are more than eighteen (18) years of age, or you are an emancipated minor, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in this Privacy Policy, and to abide by and comply with this Privacy Policy. In any case, by using the Website, you affirm that you are over the age of thirteen (13), as **THE WEBSITE IS NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER THIRTEEN (13) WHO ARE UNACCOMPANIED BY THEIR PARENT(S) OR LEGAL GUARDIAN(S)**. 

Parents and legal guardians should be aware that this Privacy Policy will govern our use of Personal Information, but also that information that is voluntarily given by children (or others) in email exchanges, bulletin boards, or the like, may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited communications. We encourage all parents and legal guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of their Personal Information while using the Internet. 

**Privacy Outside the Website**

The Website may now or in the future contain various links to other websites. We are not and cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any of those websites. Other than under agreements with certain reputable organizations and companies, and except for third party service providers (as described in this Privacy Policy), we do not share any of the Personal Information that you provide to us with any of the websites to which the Website links. Please check with those websites in order to determine their privacy policies and your rights under them.

We may use the services of third party service providers to process transactions on our behalf. By using our Website, you grant us all necessary rights and consents under applicable laws to disclose to our third party service providers -- or allow those third party service providers to collect, use, retain and disclose to us -- any Personal Information for purposes of providing services to you, including data that we may collect directly from you using cookies or other similar means.

**European Union and Other International Users**

The Services and our products are intended for individuals located in the United States, and your use of our products and services are governed by United States law.

We will only process your Personal Information when we have a legal basis to do so.

**Choices with Your Personal Information and Opting Out**

Whether you submit any Personal Information to us is entirely up to you. You are under no obligation to provide any Personal Information to us. However, this information is essential for the provision and quality of some of the services that we offer to you, so we cannot provide you with certain services or provide you with access to certain features if you choose to withhold requested information.

You may choose to prevent us from disclosing or using your Personal Information under certain circumstances ("opt out"). You may opt out of any disclosure or use of your Personal Information for purposes that are incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or for which you subsequently gave authorization by notifying us by one of the methods escribed at the end of this Privacy Policy, or by following the procedures set forth in an electronic communication from us, if applicable. Furthermore, even where your Personal Information is to be disclosed and used in accordance with the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, you may elect to opt out of such disclosure to and use by a third party that is not acting as our agent. There are some uses from which you cannot opt out, such as to provide products, features or services that you have requested from us. 

Please note that making such requests does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your content. For example, we may retain the information for our own internal records in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**Access and Correction**

Please contact us in the manner described at the end of this Privacy Policy to access your Personal Information in our possession and correct inaccuracies of that information in our records. We ask individuals to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed and amended before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests in limited circumstances, as permitted by applicable laws, rules and regulations.
