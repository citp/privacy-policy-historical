<p><br>
</p>

<p>Jimmy John's is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information collected by or submitted to us on our website at <a href="http://www.jimmyjohns.com/" class="inline_link">www.jimmyjohns.com</a> ("Website").

The following policy will explain how your personal information will be treated as you use our Website and its features.

<p>Depending upon which of our services you are utilizing, the types of nonpublic personal information that we may collect include: (i) information we receive from you on applications, forms and in other communications to us, whether in writing, in person, by telephone or any other means; (ii) information about your transactions with us, our Affiliates, or others; and (iii) information we receive from a consumer reporting agency.</p>
