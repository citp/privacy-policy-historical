We believe it is important for you to know how we treat the information you share with us. The following policy will explain how your personal information will be treated as you use our Website and its features.

				<p>Depending upon which of our services you are utilizing, the types of nonpublic personal information that we may collect include: (i) information we receive from you on applications, forms and in other communications to us, whether in writing, in person, by telephone or any other means; (ii) information about your transactions with us, our Affiliates, or others; and (iii) information we receive from a consumer reporting agency.</p>

				<h3>How We Collect Your Information</h3>
				<p>Every time you come to the Jimmy John's Website, our servers collect basic technical information. Generally, your e-mail address and all other personal information is collected only when you voluntarily provide that data while registering for activities such as online ordering or participating in surveys. For example, we may collect your domain name, the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to Jimmy John's and your browser and platform type. We do this using cookies, pixels and/or GIF files. "Cookies" are small text files that identify an individual computer's browser entering a website or other information about a website user, and are stored on a user's hard drive. They allow the site to track that browser's movement through the site over several sessions.</p>
				<p>If you do not want a cookie placed on your computer as a result of using the Website, you may disable cookies altogether by modifying the Preferences section of your Internet browser. If you reject the cookie, you may be unable to use portions of our Website that require registration, some pages of the Website might not function properly, and the Website experience will not be capable of being tailored to you from visit to visit. If you have no problem accepting cookies, but wish to be informed of their use, you may turn on a warning prompt by modifying the cookie warning section also located in the Preferences section of your Internet browser. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information about how to turn cookies on and off for your browser. Cookies are placed on your computer, and accordingly we neither store cookies on our computers nor forward them to any external parties.</p>
