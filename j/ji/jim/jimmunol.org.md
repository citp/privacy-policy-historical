The American Association of Immunologists, Inc., (AAI) respects, and is committed to protecting, the privacy of its members, subscribers and readers. This Privacy Statement describes the policy and practice for use of information collected online from the AAI website aai.org, its affiliated websites, and all order forms and member services accessible from those sites. These sites may link to other websites over which AAI has no control and, therefore, is not responsible. Your use of AAI websites constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with all the terms in this Privacy Statement, you should not use AAI websites or services.

_B) Non-Personal Information_  
AAI also collects non-personal information such as:

  1. _Cookies_. These are pieces of data placed on the user’s hard drive for a variety of reasons, including authentication (for example, to track different roles for different logins on _The[Journal of Immunology manuscript submission site](https://ji.msubmit.net/cgi-bin/main.plex)_). Cookies are collected by third party vendors with whom AAI contracts for services. Users may set browsers to alert them to the use of cookies and may reject the use of the cookie, but rejection may prevent the website from functioning properly.
  2. _IP addresses_. These are used to verify subscriber status.
  3. _Web-beacons_. These are objects embedded into a webpage or email which allow AAI to confirm that the user has viewed the webpage or the email.
  4. _Referring website addresses_.



### 2) Sharing of information

AAI does not sell or otherwise disclose the information it collects to third parties, except as follows:

  1. Certain information is shared with service providers retained by AAI. For example, in order to allow subscribers to access to _The Journal of Immunology_ , IP addresses are shared with the vendor whose servers host the journal.
  2. If required to do so by law, or if requested/subpoenaed by law enforcement agencies.
  3. Information may be disclosed to consultants for internal business purposes.
  4. AAI may sell its mailing list to parties who provide products or services of interest to immunologists. Members who do not wish to have their mailing addresses shared in this manner can contact [members@aai.org](mailto:members@aai.org). **Email addresses are never sold to third parties**.



AAI reserves the right to transfer information in the event that another entity acquires portions of the activities conducted by AAI. Should this occur, all reasonable efforts will be made to ensure the new entity follows a similar Privacy Policy to AAI.

### 3) Steps AAI takes to protect the privacy of information it collects

AAI implements reasonable technical and administrative practices to safeguard the information it collects. For example, AAI has up-to-date antivirus and antispyware programs run on its computers and servers. AAI employees are trained on appropriate use of information and the need for confidentiality. In addition, credit card payments submitted online on web pages are secured by the appropriate software and verified by VeriSign. Credit card numbers submitted online are not stored by AAI.
