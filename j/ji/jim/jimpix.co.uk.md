# privacy | jimpix ecards

This policy was updated on 19th May 2018, to bring it in line with the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://www.eugdpr.org/) which comes into force on 25th May 2018.

We abide by the UK and EU rules on Data Protection. Your private details will not be sold, traded or rented to a third party.

## Database records

### Ecards

Each time you send an ecard, the following is stored in our database:

  * Your name
  * Your email address
  * Your [IP address](http://www.howstuffworks.com/question549.htm)
  * The type of browser you use when sending an ecard
  * The recipient's email address



If the ecard is read, the record is updated to store

  * The recipient's [IP address](http://www.howstuffworks.com/question549.htm)
  * The recipient's browser



Recording the browser and IP address of the sender and recipient is classed as a [legitimate interest](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/legitimate-interests/) \- for the following reasons:

  * If the ecard service is being spammed, having the IP address and browser allows diagnostics to be carried out and the IP address to be blocked.



  * If you have sent or received an ecard and want it to be deleted from our database, please [get in touch](https://web.archive.org/web/20190824232055id_/https%3A//jimpix.co.uk/contact/) and we can delete it for you.
  * If you have a user account, you can delete any sent ecards yourself via the user pages of the website.



### User Accounts

When you sign up for a user account, a database record is created, storing:

  * First and Last Names
  * Email Address
  * Your [IP address](http://www.howstuffworks.com/question549.htm)
  * The type of browser you use when registering for the account



  * You always have the option to delete your user account. 
    * Once you do so, your user account will be deleted from the database, and any associated data will also be deleted (sent ecards, address book entries, calendar reminders, favourite ecards).
  * Alternatively, please [get in touch](https://web.archive.org/web/20190824232055id_/https%3A//jimpix.co.uk/contact/) and we can delete your account for you.
  * User accounts (and associated records) are deleted automatically if they are not used for 15 months.



If you want to view any of the information we hold on our database about you, please [get in touch](https://web.archive.org/web/20190824232055id_/https%3A//jimpix.co.uk/contact/) and we can send you the data. 

### User and Ecard Database Records - Retention Periods

  * Ecards sent from people without a user account are automatically deleted after 1 month.
  * Ecards sent from people with a user account are never deleted.
  * Unused user accounts which have not been used for 15 months are automatically deleted, along with any associated data (sent ecards, address book entries, calendar reminders, favourite ecards).



If you have any concerns or questions about this policy, please [get in touch](https://web.archive.org/web/20190824232055id_/https%3A//jimpix.co.uk/contact/).

### Additional GDPR Compliance Steps

Prior to GDPR coming into force, we did the following:

  1. Stopped storing emails from the contact form in a database. We used to do this to back up form submissions, but decided against it.
  2. Wiped the table holding email contents
  3. Deleted all old database backups apart from an export taken after step 2 carried out



## Cookies

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small files that contain text. They are sent to your browser (for example Internet Explorer or Firefox) and stored on your computer's hard disk. Their contents only identify your computer and not you personally.

They're like little flags or markers to identify your computer, so that websites can tell if your computer has been on the site before, and can be used to make your experience of using the site more engaging and less frustrating. For example, they can be used to remember that you have logged into the site. If cookies were not used, you might be forced to log in each time you visit the site - with cookies, it's possible to remember you've been on the site before, and opted for the website to remember your login session.

We use cookies to collect information about which web pages are viewed and improve the user experience on our site.

### Cookies we set ourselves on our site

If you opt for the login to remember you, the cookie will expire a year in the future. If you don't opt for it to remember your login, the cookie will be deleted when you close your browser window.

The cookie does not identify you personally - as you can see from the screenshot, the only information it contains is:

  * Name: usr1 like an internal name for the cookie, used by the website
  * Content: 62105233D8E2A062A55 here we have encrypted the userID of your user account, which links you to your user account on the database - this tells the website that you have logged in, and not someone else. The userID is encrypted to prevent other people from being able to see your details
  * Host: jimpix.co.uk the host or address of the web that the cookie is for
  * Expires: 18 November 2013 07:00:21 date the cookie will be deleted
