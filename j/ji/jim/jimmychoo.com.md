Cookies are disseminated by servers and no one may gain access to information contained therein. The information stored in cookies is gathered directly and automatically by the Website and is processed in an aggregate and anonymous manner. 

The use of cookies and other automatic data collection tools is necessary for the proper functioning of the Website and its services. In the event a user disables cookies, Jimmy Choo cannot ensure that all web pages of the Website will be displayed and/or that certain services will be supplied.
