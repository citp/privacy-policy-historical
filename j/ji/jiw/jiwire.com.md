**1\. What personally identifiable information does JiWire collect?**

The type of information we collect depends on type of service or product we are providing to you.

_When you register to use www.JiWire.com:_ JiWire owns and operates the web site www.JiWire.com. JiWire's primary goal in collecting personal information is to maximize your online experience when using our site. When you register as a member, you must provide your, e-mail address, country, and ZIP or postal code, along with information about the industry in which you work, your job function, your company size, and your household income. Once you register with JiWire.com you are no longer anonymous to us. At registration, you have the option to also provide other information to us, such as whether you wish to receive newsletters or special offers. The information we collect allows us to enable each user to personalize the use of our services and to continually improve our services. Some services are limited to authorized users, so we require this information to identify each user and to enable us to provide secure services that address the needs and preferences of specific users.

_When you register for a Registration Key to install software:_ When you download, install and use JiWire software, you are entering into a contractual relationship with JiWire according to the terms of the license agreement that is presented to you in the installation process. When you register for the Registration Key to install software, JiWire collects information including your e-mail address, country, and ZIP or postal code, along with information about the industry in which you work, your job function, your company size, and your household income. Our membership features include the ability to save information on hotspot locations, addresses, features, and reviews, so we collect personally identifiable information to allow us to provide a customizable user experience for you.

**2\. What anonymous information does JiWire collect?**

_Web-log data_

Your Internet browser has a feature called "cookies" which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to our site. Like many web sites, we use cookies to collect certain types of information when you visit our web site. However, cookies tell us nothing about who you are unless you specifically give us personally identifiable information. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit JiWire.com, but certain personalized features will not be available to you if you disable or delete cookies created during your visits. You may elect not to allow cookies to be collected by selecting certain options on your browser.

JiWire also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time, and information about the page you requested.

We may use tracking technologies for a variety of purposes, including:

  * keeping count of return visits to our site 
  * accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on our site and advertisement usage 
  * determining which features users like best 
  * saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site 
  * displaying advertising targeted to your interests and usage of our site 



_Statistical Data_

JiWire may collect certain statistical data that does not identify you. You will be prompted each time we ask for this information, and you will have the option to provide it or not. We aggregate this information and use it for the same types of purposes as we use web-log data.

**3\. Why does JiWire collect personal information, and how does JiWire use the information?**

_When you register to use www.JiWire.com:_ JiWire uses the information we gather to enhance your user experience on our site. We may use tracking information to determine how much interest a page generates overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns to those pages. This helps us continue to better understand our users and their needs. We may also use the information to customize content and advertisement for our users and to help us deliver products and services, such as our email newsletters. Additionally, we may use the information to send you information from our partners on topics that interest you.

_When you register for a Registration Key to install software:_ JiWire collects personally identifiable information in order to provide you updates and revisions to the software and to facilitate any notices between JiWire and you required by the license agreement.

**4\. What choices do you have to limit use or disclosure of personally identifiable information?**

Users who would rather not provide any of the user data requested by our registration process do not need to register with us. You can view some of the content and use some of the services offered by our site without registering, but that will limit your ability to access certain features on our site and prevent you from obtaining a Registration Key. We obtain your consent before sharing your information with others. When you request a product or service, you are consenting for us to share with our partners only the information necessary to fulfill your request. For example, if you use one of our co-branded sites or services, then you are consenting for us to share your personally identifiable information with our co-brand partner so that we can each provide you with the services related to that site. We will ensure that any partner that assists us in fulfilling your requests agrees to protect your personally identifiable information in a manner that is consistent with the manner in which JiWire protects your personally identifiable information.

**5\. Will JiWire share your information?**

JiWire is not in the business of selling your personally identifiable information to third parties. However, there are certain circumstances under which we may share personally identifiable information with our partners or other third parties. Those circumstances are:

(a) If you choose to allow us to share your information with third parties.

(b) When we are working with other companies to provide you with information, products or services that you have requested. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but must first agree to safeguard your information and not to use it for other purposes.

(c) When JiWire reasonably believes that your personally identifiable information should be shared in connection with a subpoena, court order or other legal process, or if your actions violate the law, our site's Terms of Use, a license agreement or threaten the rights or safety of JiWire or any other person.

(d) If you use services co-branded by JiWire and one of JiWire's business partners, you grant us permission to send your personally identifiable information to such business partner. Our business partners' use of such information is governed by their respective privacy policies.

Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information with anyone for any legal purpose, including without limitation with advertisers, investors and in the course of making presentations.

**6\. What about advertisements?**

Advertisers on our web site are allowed to gather information using cookies and other tracking technologies as set forth above. Except as specifically set forth in this privacy notice, JiWire does not share your personally identifiable information with advertisers. Advertisers on JiWire.com cannot identify you personally unless you register with them or specifically provide such information. If you submit personally identifiable information directly to one of our advertisers, the use, disclosure and protection of your information will be according to that advertiser's privacy policy. You should read each advertiser's privacy notice prior to submitting any personally identifiable information to that advertiser.

If you request that we delete your personal information, you may experience some degraded performance on our site. If you request that we delete information your provided when you registered for a Registration Key, the license agreement between you and JiWire for the use of the applicable software will terminate and you must delete the software from your computer.

We want for our information about you to be accurate, complete, and current. Therefore, we encourage you to monitor your information on our site and to correct and update it as necessary.

**8\. How does JiWire protect your information?**

The first step in protecting your information is ensuring that this privacy policy is fully implemented and enforced. JiWire has a Privacy Director who is responsible for ensuring our compliance with this policy and the integrity of our internal controls.
