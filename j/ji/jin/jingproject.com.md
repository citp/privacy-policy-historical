## Our Privacy Policy

TechSmith Corporation collects cookies on our Web site to capture information about page visits. This information is anonymous and we use this information only internally- we never give away information about our users- to deliver the most effective content to our visitors. Information from the cookies is used to gauge page popularity, analyze traffic patterns on our site and guide development of other improvements to our site. If you choose to e-mail us and provide personally identifiable information about yourself, we will use this information only to respond to your inquiry. We will not sell, rent or otherwise disclose that information to third parties. If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact our webmaster.

### Volunteered Information

When you sign up for a trial account, we collect personal information from you including your e-mail address. The information allows us to process your trial subscription and activate your account. We do not share this information with outside parties.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We may use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our website, new Jing Project services, and special offers we believe you will find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, you can opt-out at any time. Every promotion is sent with explicit opt-out instructions. From time to time, we may randomly contact customers about participating in a survey about our services and/or website. Your feedback helps us identify customer needs, levels of satisfaction, and improve and/or develop new products and services for you and your family. These surveys are always voluntary.

### Information Collected in Contests

If you enter one of our contests, the data we collect will be handled according to the rules of that particular contest and those rules may differ based on where you live. We provide a privacy policy specific to each contest that you should review prior to entering the contest.

### Accessing Your Information

Customers may also access their contact information through e-mail or customer service center in order to correct discrepancies and update records with new address information. See contact information at the beginning of this policy.

Changes made to this policy will be effective ten days following the posting of the new policy on the Web site. If we make significant changes to our data handling practices, we will make efforts to notify our active customers in other reasonable ways that may include an administrative email or other notice. This privacy policy will be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Michigan.
