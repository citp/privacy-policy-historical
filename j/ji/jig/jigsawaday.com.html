  <strong>JigsawADay.com</strong> does not collect personal information on its website visitors including as names, addresses,  
  or email addresses except as you specifically permit.  This information will be used only for business purposes relating to your purchases, information 
  or notifications as described below.
  <br>We hate spam as much as you do, and as such we will not mail you except as required for information regarding changes to the website, 
  or updates and announcements such as specials, CD-ROMS, bonus puzzles including those offered by a 'Tell A Friend' button, etc.  
  (Note: Using a 'Tell A Friend' button will automatically send you an e-mail 
  containing a link to extra 'reward' puzzles, and an e-mail describing the site to the 'friend' you enter. The 'friend's e-mail address 
  is not recorded by us unless THEY give us their address.) In all cases
  we will try to keep it to once a month or less but reserve the right to mail you more often if circumstances require it.
  <br>In any case, you will always have the ability to opt out of our list and removal instructions will be included at the bottom of any
  e-mails we send you, including e-mails generated by 'Tell A Friend' buttons as described above.
  </font></p><p><font face="verdana" size="2"><strong>PayPal and Google Base</strong> - We collect payments for our CD-ROMs through both PayPal and Google Base, as well as use Google for advertising, 
  and PayPal for collection of donations through programs such as the 'Buy me a cup of coffee' buttons (The donations are greatly appreciated!).
