							<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
							<br>
							<p>Last Updated: January 15, 2008</p>
							<p>At Jiffle we believe that privacy is important and that your confidence in our service is based in part on our protection of your privacy. This document sets forth the privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") of iPolipo, Inc., a Delaware corporation DBA Jiffle ("Jiffle"). (together with other services provided by Jiffle, the "Services"), Jiffle software (together with all prior and subsequent versions, and all patches and updates thereto, the "Software"), and the Web site, <a href="/jifflenow">www.JiffleNow.com</a> (including all sub-pages thereto, the "Site"). The Privacy Policy forms part of the <a href="/website/terms"><br>Terms of Service</a>.</p>
							<p>Please be aware that Jiffle's Services, Software, and Site are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13, nor may they be used to solicit or collect any information from children under the age of 13. If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use the Site nor should you sign up for the Services offered by Jiffle.</p>
							<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. Please consult the Site regularly for changes. Unless otherwise defined in this policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the meanings provided in the Jiffle Terms of Service Agreement.</p>
							<p>By using our Services you are consenting to Jiffle processing your information as described in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. These uses include the collection, storage and deletion, disclosure and transfer of your information to and from the United States to provide you with the Services you have requested.</p>
							<p>If you have any questions or comments about our practices or this Privacy Policy please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@jifflenow.com">info@jifflenow.com</a></p>
							<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
							<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and its features, to administer your account and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.</p>
							<h2>Jiffle Users: Your Information:</h2>
							<p>When you register with the Site and download the Jiffle software ("Subscribers") or accept an Jiffle subscriber's invitation to view his/her calendar by registering with us ("Contacts") (collectively referred to as "Participants") we may collect personally identifiable information, including, but not limited to, name, email address, postal address, telephone number , credit card number, and password ("Personal Information"). Personal Information is information about you that when on its own or in combination with other identifiers can be used to contact or identify you. We use your Personal Information to provide you the Services, facilitate your use of the Site and respond to your inquiries. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customers are invited to receive an email newsletter by providing an email address. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@jifflenow.com">support@jifflenow.com</a>. Separately, customers are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a Customer Newsletter. Again, email will not be distributed or shared and customers can opt out of receiving any communication by emailing <a href="mailto:support@jifflenow.com">support@jifflenow.com</a> at the time it is distributed, or at the time any customer registers for the Service.</p>
							<p>We also may collect any non-personally identifiable information that is provided to Jiffle as part of registration or in a Participant's response to an invitation, including, but not limited to, time zone; what email client and version a Participant uses (e.g., Outlook). Participants circulate amongst themselves as a result of using the Services their schedule information and other information specific to their interactions between participants..</p>
							<p>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the Jiffle Terms of Service Agreement, we do not disclose to third parties the information provided. If you subscribed originally to iPolipo via the <a href="http://www.jifflenow.com/">iPolipo.com</a> website, then all payment processing is handled by Paypal in which case your personal information is sent to, handled by and stored by Paypal (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/">https://www.paypal.com/</a>) in accordance with its Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. If you subscribe to Jiffle through the JiffleNow.com website or contact us directly, then we will use your personal information to process your payment.</p>
							<p>As a Participant or a Site visitor just browsing (who has provided us with their email address) we may use your Personal Information to send you via email Jiffle newsletters, promotional materials about other products or services and other information that you have requested or that may be of interest to you. We may also email you messages that allow you to purchase new or enhanced Jiffle products and services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information from us, you may unsubscribe by contacting <a href="mailto:support@jifflenow.com">support@jifflenow.com</a>.</p>
							<p>Because some subscription plans will have advertising presented during the use of the application, we may use your information to identify what interests you have in order to provide more personal advertising. Jiffle does not share your personal contact information with any advertiser.</p>
							<p>If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Jiffle will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Jiffle does not store this information.</p>
							<h2>Log Information</h2>
							<p>When you visit the Site, whether as a Participant or a Site visitor just browsing, like many website's our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Information"). This Log Information may include information such as your IP address, date and time, browser type and the domain from which you are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider (or "ISP"), the IP address will be different every time you log on. We do not use this information to identify you personally. We use it to analyze usage trends, administer the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical maintenance.</p>
							<h2>Change of Ownership or Other Business Transition</h2>
							<p>In the event Jiffle goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets (a "Business Transition"), your membership in Jiffle and the Jiffle servers containing Your Information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. In such event, you will be notified via e-mail and/or through a notice on our Web site and any other appropriate methods prior to the Business Transition, and Jiffle's custody of Your Information will be transferred subject to all the terms and restrictions in this Privacy Policy.</p>
							<p>Following a Business Transition, Jiffle or its successors will continue to use Your Information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we plan to use Your Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via e-mail and/or through a notice on our Web site and any other appropriate methods. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use Your Information in this different manner. Whether or not you wish to have Your Information used in this different manner, you will retain ownership rights to Your Information and the ability to delete Your Information at any time. Please note, if you have deleted or deactivated your account with the Services or are an opt-out User, then you will not be contacted, nor will Your Information be used in this different manner.</p>
							<h2>Cookies</h2>
							<p>In order to improve the Services and the Site, we use "cookies" when you are logged into the Site using your e-mail address and password. A cookie is a piece of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be understood by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your computer's identification token and enables Jiffle to personalize your experience when you are signed in to the Site. The cookie also contains your e-mail address so that we can make it easier for you to sign in. If you reject the cookie, you may not be able to sign up for some of the Services or use certain features of the Site.</p>
							<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)</p>
							<p>While Jiffle uses cookies to enable you to use the Services and the Site, and our Web servers automatically log the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your computer, Jiffle does not use this information to identify you personally except to provide you with the features of the Services.</p>
							<h2>Log Files and Backups</h2>
							<p>Like most Internet services, we use log files, both on the client and server side. The data held in log files includes your IP address, browser type, e-mail application, Internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit Web pages, computer platform type, date/time stamp, and user activity. Jiffle uses server log data to analyze trends, administer the Services and the Site, and improve service levels. IP addresses are not tied to any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
							<p>The Software has associated log and temporary files that are stored on your local hard drive and on Jiffle's servers. These files store Your Account Information, your permissions, preference settings, system notifications as well as other data necessary to operate the Jiffle services.</p>
							<p>Your Information may also exist temporarily within regularly performed server backups.</p>
							<h2>Phishing</h2>
							<p>We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Jiffle user name, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.</p>
							<p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Jiffle. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our priority.</p>
							<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
							<p><strong>Participants.</strong> Participants have the opportunity to share various types of information amongst themselves through use of the Services. You can upload and post meeting details, your bio and other documents you wish to have accessible to meeting Participants. This content along with all other information related to your use of the Services, including, but not limited to, meeting times, meeting occurrences and meeting logistics is stored and maintained on Jiffle's secure servers. Providing your Personal Information and any other information about you via the Services, is voluntary and this information will be visible to other Participants and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with other Participants.</p>
							<p><strong>Anonymous Information.</strong> We may share Anonymous Demographic Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling. This information will not contain your Personal Information.</p>
							<p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf or to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, hosting services, database management and improvement of the Site's features). These third parties may have access to your Personal Information, but only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to use it for any other purpose.</p>
							<p><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</strong> Jiffle cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Jiffle or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
							<h2>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>
							<p>All Participants may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information in their registration profile. Non-participants may also request deletion of their Personal Information from our servers. If Participants completely delete any such information, their use of the Services may be limited or terminated. If you would like us to delete your records in our system, please contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request. See below for privacy contact information.</p>
							<h2>Data Retention</h2>
							<p>We reserve the right to retain your Personal Information or other data collected from you as a result of your use of the Services to prevent fraud and misuse of the Services.</p>
							<h2>Security &amp; International Transfer</h2>
							<p>Jiffle is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. Jiffle transfers Personal Information to the United States and maintains and processes it there. You consent to such transfer.</p>
							<h2>Links</h2>
							<p>The Site contains, and the Software may present, links to other sites. Please be aware that Jiffle is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site or otherwise link to other sites, to read the privacy policies of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. Jiffle's Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Services, the Software or the Site.</p>
							<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
							<p>Jiffle is committed to protecting the privacy needs of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. Jiffle's Services, Software and Site are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13. Jiffle does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and Jiffle does not target its Services, Software and Site to children under 13.</p>
							<h2>Government Authority</h2>
							<p>You should be aware that, as with all legal contracts, our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy could be amended, terminated or modified without the consent of you and/or Jiffle by judicial proceeding, court order, in connection with bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, or pursuant to other government action. When reasonable and lawful, we will notify you if this occurs.</p>

									<p>"I work with clients all over the world, and Jiffle is the only system I've found that is easy to use, cost-effective and allows my clients and me to connect without wasting any time whatsoever--theirs or mine. With Jiffle, I spend less than 60 minutes setting up a full month of appointments in advance, which saves me at least an hour a day over the course of that month. That's tremendously valuable to a small business owner. And Jiffle delivers additional business value in terms of client satisfaction, because my clients love the application as much as I do--they even use Jiffle as a verb, as in 'Can I Jiffle you?'"</p>
