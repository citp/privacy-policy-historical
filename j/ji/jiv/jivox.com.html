  <p align="center"><strong>JIVOX</strong><br>
  <strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br>
  <strong>LAST UPDATED January 2014</strong><br>
  <strong><br>
  </strong></p>
  <p>Please  read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Jivox, its subsidiary and  affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as “<strong>Jivox</strong>”) uses and protects the  information you provide.&nbsp; This privacy  policy (the “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”)  applies to this World Wide Web site and any variations or successors to this  Web site (<a href="http://www.jivox.com/">www.jivox.com</a>,  the “<strong>Jivox Site</strong>”), any Jivox  computer software, accessible, downloadable or otherwise available from the  Jivox Site (“<strong>Jivox</strong> <strong>Software</strong>”) and any Jivox services  purchased or otherwise made available from the Jivox Site (“<strong>Jivox Services</strong>”) (collectively, the “<strong>Jivox Properties</strong>”).&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to all users (“<strong>Users</strong>”) of the Jivox Properties.</p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT  INFORMATION JIVOX COLLECTS FROM YOU</strong></p>
<p>Jivox may  collect Non-Personal information about you.</p>
<p>"<strong>Non-Personal Information.</strong>"&nbsp; Non-Personal Information refers to  information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual  (e.g. demographic information or website visitations).&nbsp; Jivox may collect Non-Personal Information  through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically through use  of industry standard technologies described further below.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW  JIVOX COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Any Personal  Information submitted to Jivox will be sent to and stored in servers located at  our Internet Data Service Provider.&nbsp; The  Personal Information practices set forth apply to all Jivox’s customers worldwide.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration</strong>.&nbsp; Prior to using one or more of the Jivox  Properties, Jivox may require certain Non-Personal Information to create an  individual account (“<strong>Account</strong>”) or to  enable features or functionality of the Jivox Properties.&nbsp; Failure to provide all required information  required by Jivox may prevent access to any or all Jivox Properties, and  failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or  termination of access to any or all Jivox Properties.&nbsp; .</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Information Collected Through Technology</strong>.&nbsp; While you are able to visit the Jivox Site  and remain anonymous, Jivox or its third party service providers may still  collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Jivox Properties (e.g.  your Internet browser, operating system, IP address, connection speed, and the  domain name of your Internet service provider).&nbsp;  Such information may be gathered by the following methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><u>Cookies</u>.&nbsp; Cookies are small pieces of information that  are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive which work by  assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the  Jivox Site.&nbsp; Cookies do not generally  contain any Personal Information.&nbsp; Most  Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your  browser to prevent this.&nbsp; Not accepting  cookies may make certain features of the Jivox Properties unavailable to you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><u>IP Address</u>.&nbsp; You may visit many areas of the Jivox Site  anonymously without the need to become a registered User.&nbsp; Even in such cases, Jivox may collect IP  addresses automatically.&nbsp; An IP address  is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin  service with an Internet service provider.&nbsp;  Each time you access the Jivox Site and each time you request one of  Jivox’s pages, the server logs your IP address.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><u>Web Beacons</u>.&nbsp; Web beacons are small pieces of data that are  embedded in Web pages and e-mails.&nbsp; Jivox  may use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that Jivox sends to Users to  determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in  those e-mails.&nbsp; The information from use  of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal  Information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><u>Tracking Content Usage</u>.&nbsp; If you use the Jivox Services and you post  audio-visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork,  graphics, video, pictures, or sound (collectively, "<strong>Content</strong>") to your Web site or to a third party Web site, Jivox  tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated with User Accounts and  the use of Content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.  Opting out of Information Collection.</strong>&nbsp; Jivox does not collect any Personal  Information for behavioral advertising and so does not currently provide an opt  out mechanism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW  JIVOX USES YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>System  Administration</strong>.&nbsp; Jivox may use  Non-Personal Information for the purposes of system administration, assisting  in diagnosing problems with Jivox servers, monitoring Jivox’s system  performance and traffic on the Jivox Properties and to gather broad demographic  information about Jivox customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personalization</strong>.&nbsp; Jivox uses cookies and IP addresses to track  features such as delivering Content specific to your interests and informing  you of new, relevant services or certain third party offerings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Notices to  Registered Users</strong>.&nbsp; If you have  registered for an Account, Jivox may use your Personal Information to send  e-mails regarding your registration, including confirmation to verify the  accuracy of any information you have provided, and instructions on how to post  Content.&nbsp; Jivox may also send you e-mails  to verify your identity or to notify you if Jivox believes your use of Jivox  Properties violates any applicable agreement for the use of the Jivox  Properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Third  Party Services</strong>.&nbsp; Jivox may share  your Personal and Financial Information with third parties who provide  services, which may include Web site hosting, promotion fulfillment, credit  card clearance, data analysis and other services of an administrative  nature.&nbsp; Personal and Financial Information  may be shared with such third parties only when necessary to facilitate your  use of the Jivox Properties. Third parties may have access to Personal and  Financial Information only to the extent needed to perform their functions, and  may not use it for other purposes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Promotional  E-mails</strong>.&nbsp; Jivox may use your Personal Information to  send you e-mails periodically listing promotions or events relating to the  Jivox Properties or from Jivox’s marketing partners or sponsors.&nbsp; You have the choice to opt-out of receiving  such promotional e-mails by sending an e-mail to remove@jivox.com and/or  following the instructions in such correspondence.&nbsp; Once Jivox has processed your opt-out  request, Jivox will not send you promotional e-mails unless you opt back in to  receiving such communications.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Contact  Information</strong>.&nbsp; If you contact  Jivox by telephone, e-mail or letter, Jivox may keep a record of your contact  information and correspondence.&nbsp; If you  report a problem with the Jivox Properties, Jivox may collect this information  in a file specific to you.&nbsp; You may  contact Jivox at admin@jivox.com to request the removal of this information  from Jivox’s database.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW  TO ACCESS AND CHANGE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Upon request, Jivox  will allow Users to update or correct Personal and Financial Information  previously submitted, but only to the extent such activities will not  compromise privacy or security interests.&nbsp;  Additionally, upon request, Jivox will delete Personal or Financial  Information from the database where such information is stored; however, it may  be impossible to entirely delete a User's entry without some residual  information being retained due to the manner in which data backups are  maintained.&nbsp; Requests to delete Personal  or Financial Information will be submitted to admin@jivox.com.</p>
<p><strong>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISCLOSURE  OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p>Jivox will not sell,  trade, rent or distribute Personal or Financial Information collected through  the Jivox Properties to any third party without your prior consent.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jivox will  disclose any information to any third party if Jivox determines, in its sole  discretion, that: (1) the law requires it or a&nbsp;  law enforcement agency has requested it; (2) it is necessary to enforce  Jivox’s terms of use or any agreement governing the Jivox Properties; or (3) it  is necessary to protect the rights, property, safety or security of Jivox, our  content providers or the public.</p>
<p><strong>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAFEGUARDING  YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Security  Measures</strong>.&nbsp; Jivox protects your Personal and Financial  Information using state-of the-art technologies, including the following.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Secure  Socket Layer</strong>.&nbsp; Secure Socket  Layer (“<strong>SSL</strong>”) encrypted  communication is used to protect all Personal and Financial Information.&nbsp; SSL is a standard format for transmitting  secure data from your computer to Jivox’s servers.&nbsp; SSL works by using a private key to encrypt  data that is transferred over the SSL connection.&nbsp; You will know SSL is being used when you see  “https” preceding a Web address, rather than “http.”&nbsp; Additionally, to protect your Personal and  Financial Information, Jivox restricts employee access to databases containing  Personal and Financial Information, imposes confidentiality requirements upon  employees who do have access to databases containing Personal and Financial  Information, and binds subcontractors with contractual, technical and  organizational measures.&nbsp; In order to  most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and billing may be handled  by third party financial institutions, which may only use your Personal and  Financial Information in connection with the business services they perform for  Jivox and not for their own benefit or otherwise.&nbsp; All information they receive is via SSL.&nbsp; Although Jivox uses reasonable efforts to  safeguard the security of your Personal and Financial Information, transmissions  made on or through the Internet are vulnerable to attack and cannot be  guaranteed to be secure.&nbsp; In addition,  submissions made via e-mail are not protected by SSL technology and are  vulnerable to interception during transmission.&nbsp;  You hereby acknowledge that Jivox is not responsible for any intercepted  information sent via the Internet, and release Jivox from any and all claims  arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information.&nbsp; <strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Third  Party Links</strong>.&nbsp; The Jivox  Properties may contain links to third parties who may collect Personal  Information and Non-Personal Information directly from you.&nbsp; Additionally, Jivox may use third parties to  provide components of the Jivox Properties.&nbsp;  In either case, such third parties may have separate privacy policies  and data collection practices, independent of Jivox.&nbsp; Jivox: (a) has no responsibility or liability  for these independent policies or actions; (b) is not responsible for the  privacy practices or the content of such Web sites; and (c) does not make any  warranties or representations about the contents, products or services offered  on such Web sites or the security of any information you provide to them.&nbsp; <strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes to Jivox’s  Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Jivox continually  strives to implement new technologies and processes to better protect you, your  privacy and your use of the Jivox Properties.&nbsp;  As a result, Jivox may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to  time.&nbsp; In no event will these changes  result in the degradation of any of the security measures designed to protect  you from unauthorized disclosure, as such measures are described in this  Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>H.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPECIAL  NOTE REGARDING CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE</strong></p>
<p>Use  of the Jivox Properties is not intended for minors under the age of 18 (“<strong>Minors</strong>”).&nbsp; Minors are not authorized by Jivox to use the  Jivox Properties, even if Minors set up an Account or accept the terms of any  agreement for Jivox Properties.&nbsp; Parents  or guardians may authorize Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 to use the  Jivox Properties, provided they assume all responsibility and legal liability  for the conduct of such Minor including, without limitation, monitoring the  Minor's access and use of the Jivox Properties.&nbsp;  Jivox does not intentionally collect nor maintain any personally identifiable  information from Minors.&nbsp; If you discover  your Minor child has submitted his or her information to Jivox, you may request  to have such information deleted from Jivox’s database by sending an e-mail  request to <a href="mailto:help@jivox.com">admin@jivox.com</a> together with  the e-mail address that was submitted by the Minor.&nbsp; Upon receiving the request, Jivox will use  reasonable efforts to delete such information.&nbsp;  If Jivox learns that a Minor is using the Jivox Properties, Jivox will  require verified parental or guardian consent, in accordance with the  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("<strong>COPPA</strong>").&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONTACT  JIVOX </strong></p>
