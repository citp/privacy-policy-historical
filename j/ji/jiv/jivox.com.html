					<p class="bold center">Privacy Policy</p>
					<p class="bold center">LAST UPDATED OCTOBER 21, 2010</p>
					
					
					
					<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Jivox, its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as "<strong>Jivox</strong>") uses and protects the information you provide.  This privacy policy (the "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") applies to this World Wide Web site and any variations or successors to this Web site (www.jivox.com, the "<strong>Jivox Site</strong>"), any Jivox computer software, accessible, downloadable or otherwise available from the Jivox Site ("<strong>Jivox Software</strong>") and any Jivox services purchased or otherwise made available from the Jivox Site ("<strong>Jivox Services</strong>") (collectively, the "<strong>Jivox Properties</strong>").  This Privacy Policy applies to all users ("<strong>Users</strong>") of the Jivox Properties.</p>
					
			<p class="bold">A. WHAT INFORMATION JIVOX COLLECTS FROM YOU</p>
			
			<p>Jivox may collect three (3) types of information about you: Personal, Financial and Non-Personal.</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>"Personal Information.</strong>"  Personal Information refers to information that lets Jivox know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you (e.g. name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address).  Jivox may collect Personal Information when you use the Jivox Properties including, without limitation, setting up account information, filling out surveys, corresponding with Jivox, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.</li>

				<li><strong>"Financial Information.</strong>"  Financial Information refers to information that relates to payment method and billing (e.g. name, credit card number, billing address) provided by you in connection with your use of the Jivox Properties.  All such Financial Information is used only for billing purposes.</li>

				<li><strong>"Non-Personal Information.</strong>"  Non-Personal Information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information or website visitations).  Jivox may collect Non-Personal Information through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically through use of industry standard technologies described further below.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p class="bold">B. HOW JIVOX COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</p>

			<p>Any Personal Information submitted to Jivox will be sent to and stored in servers located at our Internet Data Service Provider.  The Personal Information practices set forth apply to all Jivox's customers worldwide.</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Registration</strong>.  Prior to using one or more of the Jivox Properties, Jivox may require certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to create an individual account ("Account") or to enable features or functionality of the Jivox Properties.  Failure to provide all required information required by Jivox may prevent access to any or all Jivox Properties, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination of access to any or all Jivox Properties.</li>

				<li><strong>Information Collected Through Technology.</strong>  While you are able to visit the Jivox Site and remain anonymous, Jivox or its third party service providers may still collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Jivox Properties (e.g. your Internet browser, operating system, IP address, connection speed, and the domain name of your Internet service provider).  Such information may be gathered by the following methods:
				<ol>
				
					<li><span class="underline">Cookies.</span>  Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive which work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the Jivox Site (www.jivox.com). Please note that Jivox may drop a cookie on your browser. Cookies do not generally contain any Personal Information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Jivox Properties unavailable to you.
					
                      <p>Please note that any cookie dropped by Jivox would be generated from  <a href="/" class="internal">Jivox.com</a> domain. Users can easily remove Jivox cookies from their web browsers. Please visit </p>
                      
                      <p><a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=2" target="_blank">http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=2</a></p>
                      
                      <p>to find out how to remove cookies from your web browser.</p>
                    
					</li>

					<li><span class="underline">IP Address.</span>  You may visit many areas of the Jivox Site anonymously without the need to become a registered User.  Even in such cases, Jivox may collect IP addresses automatically.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin service with an Internet service provider.  Each time you access the Jivox Site and each time you request one of Jivox's pages, the server logs your IP address.  </li>

					<li><span class="underline">Web Beacons.</span>  Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in Web pages and e-mails.  Jivox may use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that Jivox sends to Users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails.  The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal Information.</li>

					<li><span class="underline">Tracking Content Usage.</span>  If you use the Jivox Services and you post audio-visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, video, pictures, or sound (collectively, "Content") to your Web site or to a third party Web site, Jivox tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated with User Accounts and the use of Content.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p class="bold">C. HOW JIVOX USES YOUR INFORMATION</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>System Administration.</strong>  Jivox may use Non-Personal Information for the purposes of system administration, assisting in diagnosing problems with Jivox servers, monitoring Jivox's system performance and traffic on the Jivox Properties and to gather broad demographic information about Jivox customers.</li>

			<li><strong>Personalization.</strong>  Jivox uses cookies and IP addresses to track features such as delivering Content specific to your interests and informing you of new, relevant services or certain third party offerings.</li>

			<li><strong>Notices to Registered Users.</strong>  If you have registered for an Account, Jivox may use your Personal Information to send e-mails regarding your registration, including confirmation to verify the accuracy of any information you have provided, and instructions on how to post Content.  Jivox may also send you e-mails to verify your identity or to notify you if Jivox believes your use of Jivox Properties violates any applicable agreement for the use of the Jivox Properties.</li>

			<li><strong>Third Party Services.</strong>  Jivox may share your Personal and Financial Information with third parties who provide services, which may include Web site hosting, promotion fulfillment, credit card clearance, data analysis and other services of an administrative nature.  Personal and Financial Information may be shared with such third parties only when necessary to facilitate your use of the Jivox Properties. Third parties may have access to Personal and Financial Information only to the extent needed to perform their functions, and may not use it for other purposes.</li>

			<li><strong>Promotional E-mails.</strong>  Jivox may use your Personal Information to send you e-mails periodically listing promotions or events relating to the Jivox Properties or from Jivox's marketing partners or sponsors.  You have the choice to opt-out of receiving such promotional e-mails by <script type="text/javascript">Rot13.write('<n uers="znvygb:vasb-hf@wvibk.pbz">fraqvat na r-znvy gb gur Wvibk Znexrgvat Grnz</n>');</script><a href="mailto:info-us@jivox.com">sending an e-mail to the Jivox Marketing Team</a><noscript><span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override;direction:rtl;">< moc.xovij@su-ofni > maeT gnitekraM xoviJ eht ot liam-e na gnidnes</span></noscript> and/or following the instructions in such correspondence.  Once Jivox has processed your opt-out request, Jivox will not send you promotional e-mails unless you opt back in to receiving such communications.</li>

			<li><strong>Contact Information.</strong>  If you contact Jivox by telephone, e-mail or letter, Jivox may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence.  If you report a problem with the Jivox Properties, Jivox may collect this information in a file specific to you.  You may <script type="text/javascript">Rot13.write('<n uers="znvygb:vasb-hf@wvibk.pbz">pbagnpg Wvibk Nqzvavfgengbe</n>');</script><a href="mailto:info-us@jivox.com">contact Jivox Administrator</a><noscript><span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override;direction:rtl;">< moc.xovij@su-ofni > rotartsinimdA xoviJ tcatnoc</span></noscript> to request the removal of this information from Jivox's database.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, you can visit <a class="external" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>			
			
			<p class="bold">D. HOW TO ACCESS AND CHANGE YOUR INFORMATION</p>

			<p>Upon request, Jivox will allow Users to update or correct Personal and Financial Information previously submitted, but only to the extent such activities will not compromise privacy or security interests.  Additionally, upon request, Jivox will delete Personal or Financial Information from the database where such information is stored; however, it may be impossible to entirely delete a User's entry without some residual information being retained due to the manner in which data backups are maintained.  Requests to delete Personal or Financial Information will be submitted to <script type="text/javascript">Rot13.write('<n uers="znvygb:vasb-hf@wvibk.pbz">Wvibk Nqzvavfgengbe</n>');</script><a href="mailto:info-us@jivox.com">Jivox Administrator</a><noscript><span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override;direction:rtl;">< moc.xovij@su-ofni > rotartsinimdA xoviJ</span></noscript>.</p>
			
			<p class="bold">E. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES</p>

			<p>Jivox will not sell, trade, rent or distribute Personal or Financial Information collected through the Jivox Properties to any third party without your prior consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jivox will disclose any information to any third party if Jivox determines, in its sole discretion, that: (1) the law requires it or a  law enforcement agency has requested it; (2) it is necessary to enforce Jivox's terms of use or any agreement governing the Jivox Properties; or (3) it is necessary to protect the rights, property, safety or security of Jivox, our content providers or the public.</p>
			
			<p class="bold">F. SAFEGUARDING YOUR INFORMATION</p>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Security Measures.</strong>  Jivox protects your Personal and Financial Information using state-of the-art technologies, including the following:</li>

				<li><strong>Secure Socket Layer.</strong>  Secure Socket Layer ("<strong>SSL</strong>") encrypted communication is used to protect all Personal and Financial Information.  SSL is a standard format for transmitting secure data from your computer to Jivox's servers.  SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL connection.  You will know SSL is being used when you see "https" preceding a Web address, rather than "http."  Additionally, to protect your Personal and Financial Information, Jivox restricts employee access to databases containing Personal and Financial Information, imposes confidentiality requirements upon employees who do have access to databases containing Personal and Financial Information, and binds subcontractors with contractual, technical and organizational measures.  In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and billing may be handled by third party financial institutions, which may only use your Personal and Financial Information in connection with the business services they perform for Jivox and not for their own benefit or otherwise.  All information they receive is via SSL.  Although Jivox uses reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your Personal and Financial Information, transmissions made on or through the Internet are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure.  In addition, submissions made via e-mail are not protected by SSL technology and are vulnerable to interception during transmission.  You hereby acknowledge that Jivox is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and release Jivox from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information.</li>

				<li><strong>Third Party Links.</strong>  The Jivox Properties may contain links to third parties who may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information directly from you.  Additionally, Jivox may use third parties to provide components of the Jivox Properties.  In either case, such third parties may have separate privacy policies and data collection practices, independent of Jivox.  Jivox: (a) has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions; (b) is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites; and (c) does not make any warranties or representations about the contents, products or services offered on such Web sites or the security of any information you provide to them.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p class="bold">G. Changes to Jivox's Privacy Policy</p>

			<p>Jivox continually strives to implement new technologies and processes to better protect you, your privacy and your use of the Jivox Properties.  As a result, Jivox may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time.  In no event will these changes result in the degradation of any of the security measures designed to protect you from unauthorized disclosure, as such measures are described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			
			<p class="bold">H. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE</p>

			<p>Use of the Jivox Properties is not intended for minors under the age of 18 ("<strong>Minors</strong>").  Minors are not authorized by Jivox to use the Jivox Properties, even if Minors set up an Account or accept the terms of any agreement for Jivox Properties.  Parents or guardians may authorize Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 to use the Jivox Properties, provided they assume all responsibility and legal liability for the conduct of such Minor including, without limitation, monitoring the Minor's access and use of the Jivox Properties.  Jivox does not intentionally collect nor maintain any personally identifiable information from Minors.   If you discover your Minor child has submitted his or her information to Jivox, you may request to have such information deleted from Jivox's database by sending an e-mail request to <script type="text/javascript">Rot13.write('<n uers="znvygb:vasb-hf@wvibk.pbz">Wvibk Nqzvavfgengbe</n>');</script><a href="mailto:info-us@jivox.com">Jivox Administrator</a><noscript><span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override;direction:rtl;">< moc.xovij@su-ofni > rotartsinimdA xoviJ</span></noscript> together with the e-mail address that was submitted by the Minor. Upon receiving the request, Jivox will use reasonable efforts to delete such information.  If Jivox learns that a Minor is using the Jivox Properties, Jivox will require verified parental or guardian consent, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("<strong>COPPA</strong>").</p>
