    </p>

    <h5>The My.jobs Platform</h5>

    <p>
        We share your job search activity and profile data with employers with whom you have

        interacted via our services. Employers may use your job search activity and profile data to send

        you messages, such as job opportunities, hiring events, career fairs, and general information

        We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with

        our business activities such as offering customer service or sending emails. These companies are

        authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us and

        are contractually obligated to keep your information confidential.
    </p>

    <h5>Legal Disclaimer</h5>

    <p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process</li>
        <li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request</li>
        <li>if DE is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information</li>
        <li>to any other third party with your prior consent to do so</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Access and Choice</h3>

    <p>
        If your personal information changes, you may correct, update, amend, remove, or ask to have

        it removed by making the change on your user <a href="https://secure.my.jobs/account/edit/">account settings</a> page or by submitting a service

        request via the My.jobs <a href="https://secure.my.jobs/contact/">Contact</a> page. You may deactivate or delete your account from the

        account settings page at any time, or contact us directly. We will respond to your request within

        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h5>Tracking Technologies / Cookies</h5>

    <p>
        Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by DirectEmployers Association, our member companies and our partners (talent networks, partner job sites, company microsites and career sites), affiliates, or analytics or service providers (error and performance tracking and monitoring, traffic analysis). These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. 
        We use cookies to remember users’ settings, sites visited and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.
    </p>

    <h5>Analytics / Log Files</h5>

    <p>
        As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log

        files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service

        provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream

        data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends,

        to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic

        information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to

        personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h5>Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting</h5>

    <p>
        We may partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website or to

        manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to

        collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites

        to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this

        information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/">here</a> (if located in the European Union, click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>).

        Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive

        generic ads.
    </p>

    <h5>Local Storage Objects</h5>
    <p>
        We use Local Storage such as HTML5 to store content and preferences related to user-interface 
        manipulation and display. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our 
        site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity also use HTML 5 to collect 
        and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
    </p>


    <h3>Security</h3>

    <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive

        information (such as your username and password) in our log-in portal, we encrypt the

        transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
    </p>

    <p>
        We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us,

        both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet,

        or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its

        absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you may contact us

        using the My.jobs Contact page.
    </p>

        privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
