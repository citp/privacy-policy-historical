J.Crew will not sell, rent or share your email address with third parties to send you unsolicited email.  However, in our ongoing effort to provide you with the best service possible, we may share your information with our family of brands and/or affiliated companies (including crewcuts and Madewell) for their use. 
<br><br>
When you supply your postal address, either when requesting a catalog or placing an order, you may receive a catalog by mail from J.Crew or one of our other brands or affiliated companies (including crewcuts and Madewell). We occasionally make our postal list available for limited use by a few reputable and carefully screened firms, but at your request, we will not share your address with anyone. Requests can be sent to <a href="mailto:contactus@jcrew.com">contactus@jcrew.com</a>.
<br><br>
When you place an order on jcrew.com, we use this information to process and track your order and contact you via email, postal mail or phone if we have any questions or concerns regarding your order. If you provide an email address during checkout, you will also receive order and shipping confirmation emails. 
<br><br>
We also maintain a record of your purchases made on jcrew.com and through our J. Crew family of websites (including crewcutkids.com and madewell1937.com) and combine this with information you have provided in our retail stores or over the phone in order to serve you better. We may combine information you provide with demographic information, information gathered from our other brands and affiliated companies (including crewcuts and Madewell), and information that is publicly available. We may also use information about your product preferences and interests in order to improve our site design and enhance your shopping experience. 
<br><br>
When we offer sweepstakes, contests, promotions or surveys, you may be required to provide certain personal information so we can notify winners and/or fulfill promotional obligations. In these instances, you have the option to receive emails or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. Even if you have previously chosen not to receive email or postal mail from us, you may still receive information as it relates to the sweepstakes, contest, promotion or survey in which you have participated.

<br><br>
In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, J.Crew may disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy.

<br><br>
You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if required to do so by law, governmental request or court order or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with such law, request or court order or to protect the users of our web site or the public.

J.Crew works with reputable third parties who perform services on our behalf. Sometimes these service providers need information about our customers in order to do their jobs, such as fulfill orders and promotions, maintain and manage our customer database and report on customer behavior and/or preferences. When J.Crew allows these service providers access to your information, we require them to maintain your information in the strictest confidence and do not permit them to use it in any way other than to help us provide you with better service.

We currently use the services of a few carefully selected marketing companies to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications.  These companies help us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site.  To do this, cookies and web beacons are placed on our web site on our behalf.  The type of information we collect includes pages visited, products viewed and products placed in your shopping cart.  By supplementing our records, this information enables us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.  Although our marketing partners log the information coming from our site on our behalf, the data retrieved cannot be used for any reason without our authorization.  If you prefer us not to have your information included in our ongoing site analysis to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt out" by <a href="http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product">clicking here</a>.   

<br><br>

In addition, we may share statistical, demographic and other non-personally identifiable information with third party companies to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications.

If you are visiting jcrew.com through YourShops.ca, information about your visit through the jcrew.com pages and your online shopping experience will be accessed by YourShops.ca.

If you forget your password, you can request that it be emailed to your email address. We will not give passwords out over the phone, nor will we email them to a different email address than the one used to register. If you request to have your password emailed to you, your credit card information will be deleted from your profile.

Your address book, located in the 'my account' page, is your personal storage space. We do not use the names of the people in your address book to send email promotions or catalogs by mail.
