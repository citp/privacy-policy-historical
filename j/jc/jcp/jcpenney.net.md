**our use of cookies and other technologies**

**cookies** \-  A cookie is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer or device. When you arrive at our website, cookies allow us or our services providers to recognize you by an identification number in the cookie. We and our service providers use "cookies" to collect and analyze information about your browsing and buying activity on our site, whether through the Internet or mobile applications.. You may use the privacy settings on your web browser to disable cookies. If so, you can still browse our websites, but you may not have as exceptional a shopping experience as one that is specifically tailored to your needs. However, if you block cookies you will not be able to make a purchase on our websites.

**web beacons** \- A “web beacon” (also called a pixel tag or a clear gif) is a tiny graphic image placed on website pages and in emails, advertising, and other marketing communications that allows us and our service providers to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access those pages or open email messages, or click on advertising, the web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.  That information is used to analyze what our visitors like to do on our site or mobile applications, and the effectiveness of our features and advertising, as well as interactions with our e-mail and advertising.

**wireless beacons** \- A wireless beacon is a small device that we may use as part of our in-store experience. Wireless beacons broadcast a signal that can be received by compatible devices, such as a mobile phone or tablet, when those devices are within the proximity of the beacon. When you choose to download the JCPenney mobile application, we and our service providers may use wireless beacons in conjunction with the JCPenney mobile application to personalize and enhance your in-store shopping experience and to understand your interests so that we can provide relevant notifications, offers, and promotions.

**flash cookies** – A flash cookie (also known as a Local Shared Object) is a persistent data file stored on your computer by the websites you visit using Adobe Flash technology. We or our service providers may use Flash cookies to enable or control Flash-based content and for other uses similar to those provided by the cookies discussed earlier in this section. You can manage the use of Flash cookies via the Settings Manager on Adobe’s website at https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html

**analytics services** \- JCPenney uses third party analytics companies to collect and analyze information about how people use our websites and mobile applications, including information about browsing and buying activities. They may collect and use information from first- and third-party cookies. In addition, analytics companies also provide services that analyze information regarding visits to certain portions of jcpenney.com that are operated for JCPenney by third parties. They use cookies and web beacons to collect this information.

**technology used to serve advertising** : We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads (e.g. banners or links) tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop on jcpenney.com and other sites over time, and to perform tracking and reporting functions with respect to our ads. We also allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our site and to use that information to serve ads for JCPenney products or services, or the products or services of other companies when you visit our site or other sites. For instance, we and third-party vendors, such as Google, use first- and third-party cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to inform, optimize and serve ads based upon a user’s past visits to our website and to report upon how our ad impressions and other ad services are related to jcpenney.com.  We may combine and associate the information we collect through these technologies with other information we have collected from and about you. This collective information may be used, among other things, for interest-based advertising to personalize your online experience, improve our website, evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising, and to tailor our marketing to you.

At this time, we do not respond to browser “do not track” signals, but we do provide you the option to opt-out of interest-based advertising, as well as the other choices described in the “your choices about the information we collect” section of this policy.

**links to other sites and social media widgets**  

You may navigate to other websites from JCPenney websites.  When you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to that site operator’s privacy policy. We encourage you to read that policy before submitting any personal information.

Our websites and our mobile applications include social media features, for example the Facebook Like button, and Facebook, Google Plus, Interest, and Twitter widgets. Social media features or widgets are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.

**children's privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 through our websites or mobile applications.

**notice to California residents - your California privacy rights**

Under California law, a California resident with whom JCPenney has an established relationship has the right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information JCPenney has shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and the identities of those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to:  J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc., P.O. Box 10001, Dallas, TX 75301.  Attention: Corporate Customer Care.

This same California law permits JCPenney to provide you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information shared rather than providing the above described information. You may exercise that choice by any of the means described under "opt-out of sharing with other companies for their marketing purposes".
