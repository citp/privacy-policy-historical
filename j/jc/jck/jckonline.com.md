### Cookies and GIFs

When you visit this site, we may collect the IP address of your computer.  We also use automatic data collection technology to record other information that identifies your computer and tracks your behavior on this site.  Methods of collecting this information may include “cookies” and “clear GIFs” (also knows as “pixel tags” or “beacons”).  A cookie is a bit of data sent by a web site through the browser to the computer of the user visiting the site, and enables the site to return the results the browser expects. The JCKonline.com web site uses temporary, session-specific cookies to ensure visits to its web sites are smooth and customized for the visitor. Such cookies allow us to provide a visitor’s browser with information tailored to the visitor’s preferences and needs. We use permanent or persistent cookies that remain on a visitor’s computer after the visitor leaves the JCKonline.com web site. However, our cookies neither reveal nor contain any identifying or personal data. Cookies also cannot read any information on a visitor’s computer or interact with other cookies on the visitor’s hard drive.

If you do not want your browser to accept cookies, you can turn off the cookie acceptance option in the browser’s settings. However, disabling the cookie support function of the browser will prevent our web site from functioning properly and you may not be able to utilize fully all of the site’s features and information.

A clear GIF is a small graphic image, typically used in connection with cookies, that is placed on a web site or in an email message.  A clear GIF can monitor certain user behavior such as your usage of the site, whether you opened an email message, or whether you clicked on a URL in the email message.  We do not collect Professional or Financial information this way, but if you provided Professional Information to this site, we may associate that information with the behavioral information collected automatically from the clear GIF.

### Policy Changes

RX-US reserves the right to review and change this Policy. Policy changes may be made without prior notice to existing customers. Policy revisions only apply to information gathered as of the effective date of the revised policy, unless we give you notice and choice as to the changes in use, in which case all information is subject to the new policy.  Your continued use of this site after any and all Policy changes means that you accept the changes.
