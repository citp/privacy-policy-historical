# JB Hi-Fi | Privacy Policy

**Introduction**

JB Hi-Fi Limited and its subsidiaries (“JB Hi-Fi”) recognise that your personal information is important to you and that you are concerned with its collection, use and disclosure.  JB Hi-Fi, like other companies operating in Australia, is bound by the National Privacy Principles as set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) which set clear standards regarding these activities.

This policy contains information about: 
  * when you can deal with JB Hi-Fi anonymously;
  * the purposes for which JB Hi-Fi collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information;
  * the types of personal information that JB Hi-Fi collects;
  * how JB Hi-Fi collects and holds personal information;
  * how you may access the personal information that JB Hi-Fi holds about you, and how you may seek correction of that personal information; and
  * how you may complain about a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles by JB Hi-Fi and how JB Hi-Fi will deal with such a complaint.



Appendix A to this policy contains further information which JB Hi-Fi is required to disclose under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) to individuals who apply in-store for credit from a third party credit provider (such as HSBC or Telstra).

We may also use your personal information for other purposes related to those described above which would be reasonably expected by you.

### When can you deal with JB Hi-Fi anonymously?

Generally, you can deal with JB Hi-Fi anonymously (i.e. without identifying yourself). In certain circumstances however, JB Hi-Fi will ask you to provide personal information because it is required by law to do so, or because it would be impracticable to deal with you anonymously. These circumstances include where you order goods online (including when you pick up such goods from one of our stores), where you trade-in or buy second-hand games, where you purchase pre-paid mobile phone services, where you sign up to a post-paid mobile phone plan, where you purchase an extended warranty on a product, where you apply to purchase goods on finance, where you return goods for repair, where you purchase goods to be delivered or installed, where you create a JB Hi-Fi NOW account, where you enter one of our competitions, when you submit a request, enquiry, complaint, consumer guarantee or warranty claim, when you pre-order goods and when you purchase goods on lay-by.

### Why does JB Hi-Fi collect, hold, use and disclose personal information?

JB Hi-Fi collects, holds, uses and discloses personal information for a number of purposes connected with our business operations, which include: 
  * providing you with products and/or services requested;
  * dealing with requests, enquiries, complaints, consumer guarantee or warranty claims, and other customer care related activities;
  * marketing our products and services and providing advice on our products;
  * developing and improving our products and services;
  * in connection with our loyalty or reward programmes and competitions;
  * the operation and administration of accounts or subscriptions that you have with us (including certain features of JB Hi-Fi NOW accounts or subscriptions through which other users can view certain information about you, unless you opt out of these features);
  * payment processing;
  * carrying out certain checks (for example, for our fraud or theft prevention processes, if you wish to open an account with us, obtain credit from us or pick-up goods in-store that have been ordered online);
  * interacting with companies or organisations with whom JB Hi-Fi has a business relationship (where you work for, or otherwise represent, such an organisation);
  * reconciling payments due to JB Hi-Fi from suppliers in relation to goods or services provided to you by those suppliers;
  * purposes relating to any third party acquisition or potential acquisition of an interest in JB Hi-Fi or its assets;
  * complying with our obligations under agreements with third parties (for example, under our authorised dealer arrangements with Telstra and our arrangements with consumer finance providers); and
  * carrying out any activity in connection with a legal, governmental or regulatory requirement that we have to comply with, or in connection with legal proceedings, crime or fraud prevention, detection or prosecution. In particular, JB Hi-Fi is required by law to collect personal information in certain circumstances, including: 
    * if you trade-in goods (under, depending on the State or Territory in which you are located, the Second-hand Dealers and Pawnbrokers Act 2003 (Qld), the Second-hand Dealers and Pawnbrokers Act 1996 (SA), the Second-hand Dealers and Pawnbrokers Act 1994 (Tas), the Second-Hand Dealers and Pawnbrokers Act 1989 (Vic), the Consumer Affairs and Fair Trading Act 1990 (NT) and related regulations); and
    * if you purchase pre-paid mobile telecommunications services (under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) and the Telecommunications (Service Provider Identity Checks for Pre-paid Public Mobile Telecommunications Services) Determination 2000).



We may also use and disclose your personal information for other purposes related to those described above which would be reasonably expected by you. 

Documents (including hard copy documents and electronic documents such as emails) which coincidentally contain personal information will also be retained in accordance with JB Hi-Fi's normal document retention practices for accounting, legal and business purposes.

### How JB Hi-Fi will handle complaints

After receiving a complaint, we will consider whether we need any further information from you to properly consider and investigate the complaint, and may request such information from you. We will then:

  * conduct internal discussions with the relevant business units involved in the collection, holding, use or disclosure of your personal information which is the subject of your complaint, and evaluate whether we believe that such collection, holding, use or disclosure of your personal information was in breach of the Australian Privacy Principles; and
  * notify you of the results of our investigation of your complaint.



If the conclusion of our investigation is that our collection, holding, use or disclosure of your personal information was in breach of the Australian Privacy Principles, we will take steps to remedy the breach as soon as reasonably practicable.

We will endeavour to notify you of the results of our investigation of your complaint within 30 days of receiving your complaint. However, if your complaint involves complex matters or requires extensive investigation and consultation, it may not be possible to respond within this timeframe. 

 If you are not satisfied with our response to your complaint you are entitled under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) to make a complaint to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. Information about how to make a complaint is available from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner's website (www.oaic.gov.au).

### Additional information for purchasers of mobile phones

When you buy a mobile phone, JB Hi-Fi will ask you to provide proof of identity details such as a Credit Card, Drivers License or Passport and the phone's unique identification number (IMEI) will be recorded. In the case of prepaid phones which include a sim card and phones sold in conjunction with post-paid phone plans your personal information is collected in accordance with government regulations, as a condition of JB Hi-Fi's licence as a Telstra dealer and for the purpose of provisioning Telstra services and accounts. If you refuse to provide this information when purchasing a product of this type then JB Hi-Fi will not be able to sell it to you. 

JB Hi-Fi also collects and retains personal information, such as your name, proof of ID reference number, date of birth, address and phone IMEI number from the sale of all mobile phone handsets for the purpose of record keeping in accordance with its Consumer Guarantees Compliance Program (warranties regarding acceptable quality and fitness for purpose), including for the purpose of facilitating efficient retrieval and authentication of records in the event of warranty claims and product returns (for example, if you have lost your receipt). Details are also recorded in accordance with JB Hi-Fi's fraud and theft prevention strategies. 

In the case of an "Outright" phone purchase, personal information is not transmitted to any telecommunications carrier or government agency. 

If you are purchasing an Outright Phone (a phone without a Sim card included and that is not on a "plan") in a JB Hi-Fi store and do not wish to have JB Hi-Fi collect your personal information, you can advise JB Hi-Fi staff that you would like to purchase the Outright Phone "Anonymously". Staff will still be required to collect the phone's unique IMEI number but will not record any personal identity information in JB Hi-Fi's system and will record the sale as "Anonymous". Purchasing an Outright Phone "Anonymously" means that, if you lose your receipt, JB Hi-Fi may not be able retrieve evidence of your proof of purchase for consumer guarantee (warranty) purposes. Please note that you will not be able to purchase an Outright Phone "Anonymously" if you are purchasing online (including for pick-up in store). 

JB Hi-Fi does not use any personal information collected during the process described above for any marketing purposes. 

The other provisions of this Privacy Policy also apply to the purchase of mobile phones.
