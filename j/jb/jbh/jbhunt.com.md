Participation in these surveys and contests is completely voluntary; you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore whether to disclose the requested information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code or age level). For contests, contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes, and may be used for other purposes, if specified.

Your participation in surveys administered by third parties is subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of such third parties.

 **Information We Collect Through Technology**  
We collect information through technology to enhance our ability to serve you. For example, when you visit the Site, we may collect your domain name, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser version, operating system, and the website you passed through to reach our Site. In addition, our Site gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Site and its areas, activity levels, most used browsers, and other useful statistics similar to the television ratings which tell how many people tuned into a program.

 **Do we use cookies on our site?**  
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser that enables the Website to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to help us understand and save your preferences for future visits to the Website. For example, when you return to the Website after prior visits, cookies provide information to the Website so that it will immediately recognize you as a return visitor, which can improve your browsing experience and save you time when returning to the Website or specific pages on our Website.

Depending on the browser you use, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies by adjusting your browser settings. Like other websites, if you turn your cookies off, some of the features on jbhunt.com may not function properly.

 **Google Analytics and Other Third Parties**  
We use cookies provided by Google Analytics, a third-party service provider, to assist us in better understanding visitors to the Website. These cookies collect data tied to a user’s IP address such as the length of time a user spends on a page, the pages a user visits, and the websites a user visits before and after visiting jbhunt.com. Based on this information, Google Analytics compiles aggregate data about Website traffic and Website interactions, which we use to offer you a better experience when you visit jbhunt.com. Other Google advertising features we use include Dynamic Remarketing, DoubleClick, and AdWords Conversion. You can obtain more information about Google Analytics here: <https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html?hl=en-GB>.

 **Your ‘Do Not Track’ Browser Setting**  
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a preference you can set in your browser’s settings to let the websites you visit know that you do not want the websites collecting your personal information. Our Site does not currently respond to DNT browser settings across all pages and features of the Site. We will not collect personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, regardless of whether you choose the DNT browser preference. However, we may use trusted third-party tools to analyze website usage, monitor performance, and prevent fraud. These tools may collect personal information about you or your online activities at this Site or across different sites over time by using cookies or by any other means.

 **Links to and Plug-Ins from Other Websites or Media**  
The Site includes links from the Site to sites or applications operated by third parties as well as plug-ins that permit access to third-party sites (such as Twitter buttons) and, with respect to the J.B. Hunt 360 applications, a hosted payment portal (collectively, “Third-Party Sites”). We do not control any Third -Party Sites, and we are not responsible for any information they may collect. The information collection practices of a Third -Party Site are governed by that site’s privacy policy. It is your choice to enter any Third -Party Site.

### How We Protect the Information We Collect

The security and confidentiality of your personal information is important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure and improper use. For example, we use 256-bit Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect the data collection forms on the Site. In addition, access to your personal information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personal information. All employees with access to personal information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. After a new policy is added, these employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to enhance protection for our customers' personal information. In addition, the servers that we use to store personal information are kept in a secure, restricted access area.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your computer and to your account. Be sure to log out of your account or to close your browser after you have completed your visit to our Site.

Please note that despite our reasonable efforts, no security measure is ever perfect, so we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.
