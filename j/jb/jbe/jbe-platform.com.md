### The purposes for which we process data

We do not sell, share or transfer personal information except as set out in this privacy notice. 

We may process your data to **enter into contracts** with you. Where you ask us to provide services to you, we will process your personal data so that we can deliver these services to you. Our use of personal data in this way includes sharing your personal data with our employees and other personnel, partner agencies, suppliers and sub-contractors such as credit reference agencies. Such processing is necessary for us to be able to enter into and perform the contract for the supply of services you have requested from us and this is the legal basis for such processing. If you do not wish to provide us with your personal data in this way, you will be unable to receive services from us.

We may process your personal data in order to provide various supporting **customer services** to you (such as where you contact us with a question in connection with our services and / or request certain information from us). The legal basis on which we process your personal data in these circumstances is our respective legitimate interests of providing or receiving customer services and communicating with you. If you do not provide us with the personal data we request from you for customer services purposes, we may not be able to fully answer your queries.

We may process your personal data in order to provide you with a more tailored **user experience**. We may also use your personal data to make sure our site is displayed in the most effective way for the device you are using. We also use various cookies to help us improve our site (see also the section on cookies). We will also process personal data for the purposes of making our site more secure, and to administer our site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes. The legal basis on which we process personal data in these circumstances is our legitimate interest to provide you with the best customer experience we can, and to ensure that our site is kept secure.

We may process your personal data for **marketing** purposes after you have expressly opted in to receive marketing communications from us. The legal basis for the processing of your data is your explicit permission. We may also use data that you have given us to provide you with information about other goods and services we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about. In that case, the legal basis is our legitimate interest to develop our services and grow our business.

In certain circumstances we may also need to share your personal data if we are under a duty to disclose or share personal data in order to comply with any **legal obligation** , or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety, of us, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

We do not sell personal information to any third parties, unless it is included in the **sale of (part of) our business** to another party. For instance, if we would sell a journal to another publisher, the subscriber list and information about archive access rights might be included.

We retain the information that we have about you only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, and to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.   
 

### Rights

  1. You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you, or by contacting us.
  2. You have the right to ask us to correct any incorrect personal information that we store about you. It is important that this personal information is accurate and current, so please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your relationship with us. 
  3. You have the right to ask us for an electronic copy of the personal information that we store about you. 
  4. You have the right to ask us to delete personal information (‘right to be forgotten’) that we hold about you. Please note that this may also mean that we will no longer be able to provide you with services that are linked to your personal access rights.



Please email us at _privacy@benjamins.nl_ to request your information, to provide us with correct information, or to ask for information to be deleted from our systems.

In principle, this will be done free of charge, but we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. 

In order to perform any of these requests, we are obliged to confirm your identity, and we may need to ask specific information from you for that purpose. We may also contact you for further information in relation to your request.

We aim to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days. If your request is complicated, it may take us longer, but in that case we will let you know about this within 30 days and we will keep you updated on the progress.  
 

### Security

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
