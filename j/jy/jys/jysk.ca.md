With your consent, we may use your personal information for many different purposes, for example:

  * Fulfill requests for products, services or information;

  * Tailor our online or retail store offerings to your preferences.



We only collect personal information from you when you voluntarily offer the information, such as when signing up for online newsletters or when you set up an account with us.

You are able to modify all personal information that is stored after the completion of an online transaction by logging into your account.
