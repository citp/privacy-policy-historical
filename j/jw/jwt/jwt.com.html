    <h2>JWT Internet Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This website is provided by J. Walter Thompson U.S.A., Inc ("JWT"). We take very seriously the privacy of our website users and the security of their personal information.</p>

    <p>For your convenience, this website contains links to a number of other websites, both inside and outside JWT. The privacy policies and procedures described here do not apply to those sites; we suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their data collection and distribution policies. </p>

    <p>The purpose of this privacy policy is to set out the principles governing our use of personal information that we may obtain about you. By using the websites, or by registering as a user of the services that we provide, you agree to this use. We ask you to read this privacy policy carefully.  Any dispute which may arise over privacy will be subject to this policy and the data protection notice (if any) incorporated into this website.</p>

    <p>We may change our privacy policy from time to time. We therefore ask you to check it occasionally to ensure that you are aware of the most recent version that will apply each time you access this website. </p>

    <h2>Personal information collection and use</h2>
    <p>JWT will only collect personally identifiable data, such as your name or email address, when it is voluntarily submitted to us at this website.

We will not otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information you provide at this website to any third party unless otherwise disclosed to you.</p>

    <h2>Non-personal information collection and use</h2>
    <p>In common with many commercial organizations we monitor the use of this website by collecting aggregate information. We may automatically collect non-personal information about you such as the type of internet browsers you use, the pages you visit or the website which directed you to our site. You cannot be identified from this information and it is used only to assist us in providing an effective service on this website. </p>

    <h2>Use of cookies</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small files which are sent to your web browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. These allow you to carry information across our site without having to re-enter it; it also enables us to analyze web traffic and improve our online services. They cannot be used to identify you. You may set your web browser to notify you of cookie placement requests or to decline cookies completely.

    <h2>Security of your personal data</h2>
    <p>We have implemented technologies and policies with the objective of protecting your information from unauthorized access and improper use and will update these measures as appropriate as new technologies become available. </p>

You may be able to access your Personal Information and correct, amend or delete it where it is inaccurate, except as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question;</li>
      <li>Providing access to your Personal Information would be likely to reveal Personal Information about others;</li>
      <li>Disclosing the information would reveal the confidential commercial information of JWT or its clients.</li>
