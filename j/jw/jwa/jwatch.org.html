          <p class="small"><em>Last updated: December 2015</em></p>
          <h3>Governing Principles</h3>
          <p>NEJM Group is a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society (“MMS”). We take privacy issues seriously and are committed to protecting your personal information. Please take a moment to review our privacy policy.</p>
          <p>This policy explains how the information we collect when you use an NEJM Group website, mobile or tablet application, or other online service (each a “Service” and collectively “Services”) that links or refers to this policy will be used and shared. This privacy policy does not apply to or govern information furnished to the MMS through any other means.</p>
          <h3>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
          <h4>Information You Provide to Us</h4>
          <p>We will request information from you if you establish a personal profile to gain access to certain content or services, if you ask to be notified by e-mail about online content, or if you participate in surveys we conduct. This requires the input of personal information and preferences that may include, but is not limited to, details such as your name, username and password, address (postal and e-mail), telephone number, professional background and educational information, demographic information and, where applicable, other information about your professional board membership and certification. If you request paid content or services, including subscriptions, we will also ask for payment information such as credit card type and number. </p>
          <p>If you choose to register and sign in using a third party account, the authentication of your login is handled by the third party account and the Services will collect your name, email address and any other information about your third party account that you agree to share at the time you give permission for your account on the Services to be linked to your third party account. </p>
          <h4>Information Collected Automatically</h4>
          <p>In addition to the information that you provide to us directly, we may collect information about your use of the Services to help us measure and analyze traffic and usage. This helps us to enhance and improve the Services. For example, we may collect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Device Information</em> — such as your hardware model, IP address, other unique identifiers, operating system version and settings of the device you use to access a Service.</li>
            <li><em>Usage Information</em> — such as information about the Services you use, the date and time, the duration of your usage, the files downloaded or viewed, and other information about your interaction with content offered through a Service.</li>
            <li><em>Location information</em> — such as the physical location of your device in order to provide you with more relevant content for where you are in the world.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><em>Cookies</em></h4>
          <p>We use cookies to collect information and help personalize your user experience. We store minimal personally identifying information in cookies and protect this information. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to use a Service and help us to personalize your user experience and track usage. We do not store complete records or credit card numbers in cookies. You can find out more about how we use cookies at our <a href="../legal/cookie-information.htm" title="NEJM Group Cookie Information" target="_blank">Cookie Information page</a>.</p>
          <p>We also may use cookies and other tracking technology to facilitate the delivery of relevant ads to you through the Services. </p>
          <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Browsers can be configured to prevent this, but if you do not accept any cookies, you will not be able to make full use of the Services.  </p>
          <p>In some cases we also work with third-party vendors (such as Google) to help deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These vendors may use cookies to collect information about your use of the Services (i.e., the pages you have visited) in order to help deliver particular ads that they believe you would find most relevant. You can opt out of those vendors’ use of cookies to tailor advertising to you by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" title="Consumer Opt Out" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</em></strong><br>
            We may also use clear gifs, which are tiny graphics with unique identifiers that function similarly to cookies to help us to track activity. We do not use these to collect personally identifying information.</p>
          <h3>HOW IS THIS INFORMATION USED?</h3>
          <p>Information that you provide to us will be used to process, fulfill, and deliver your requests for content and services and, where applicable, report points and credits to credentialing organizations.
