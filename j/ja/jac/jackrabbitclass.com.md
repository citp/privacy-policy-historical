[**Frequently Asked Questions**](https://web.archive.org/web/20101229223553id_/http%3A//jackrabbitclass.com/faqs.asp)  
To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following principles:  
**Information**  
Jackrabbit will not disclose your private and confidential information to any outside organization. Information regarding your organization (such as organization name, address and phone number) will not be given or sold to any outside organization.  
**Security**  
You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. While we strive to protect your confidential information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  
**Data Encryption**  
  
Jackrabbit is committed to data security with respect to information collected and maintained on our site(s). To help protect your confidential information, we support the ability to encrypt all data. Encryption is a process by which we use software to scramble your confidential information in transit to and from Jackrabbit. 

The Jackrabbit site utilizes an industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of confidential information. Use of our site requires the use of either Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.0 (or higher) or Netscape Navigator 4.0 (or higher). These browsers are security-enabled so you can choose whether or not the information you transmit to us is encrypted, making it extremely difficult to read even if it is wrongly intercepted.   
  
**Commitment**  
Personal data privacy is a policy we are committed to and Jackrabbit is constantly addressing new demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at [info@JackrabbitTech.com](mailto:info@JackrabbitTech.com)
