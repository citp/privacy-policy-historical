## Section I – Jackrabbit Technologies Advertising Services

 

The benefits of interest based advertising:

Save Money: Relevant ads can offer you deals and discounts that will interest you and save you money.

Free Your Inbox: Brands can market to you without clogging your email inbox with messages.

Keep Content Free: Free online content is made possible by effective online advertising, like retargeting.

 

**What information does Jackrabbit Technologies collect and how do we use that information?**

 

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**

 

Jackrabbit Technologies collects data about your activities that does not personally or directly identify you when you visit our website, the website of entities for which we serve advertisements (our “Advertisers”), or the websites and online services where we display advertisements (“Publishers”). This information may include the content you view, the date and time that you view this content, the products you purchase, or your location information associated with your IP address. We use the information we collect to serve you more relevant advertisements (referred to as Retargeting, Pay Per Click Advertising, PPC, Display Advertising, Remarketing, Dynamic Ads, Google Adwords Ads, Similar Audience Ads, Bing Ads, Yahoo!, Demand Side Platform (DSPs), Real Time Bidding Platforms and similar online advertising platforms). We collect information about where you saw the ads we serve you and what ads you clicked on.

We do not target ads to you based on sensitive personal data, such as information related to race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition or sexual life.  Where permitted by law, we do work with health and fitness companies and may show you more relevant ads based on your perceived interest in these topics.

Jackrabbit Technologies may target ads based on data provided by Advertisers or partners alone or in combination with the data we collect ourselves. Any data used to serve targeted advertisements is de-identified and is not used to personally or directly identify you. We require third parties, including Publishers, to provide notice and obtain appropriate consent, where required by applicable law.

 

**Third Parties on our Website and Our Advertisers’ Websites**

 

In order to allow Jackrabbit Technologies and our Advertisers to reach the best inventory online, we work with third party advertising companies (our “Advertising Partners”) to help us recognize you and serve relevant advertisements to you when you visit a website or online service in their network. We also work with Advertising Partners who help us recognize you across different devices in order to show you relevant advertisements. Our Advertising Partners may collect information about your activities on our website, our Advertisers’ websites, and other websites or online services in their networks. We also work with third party companies to assist us with website analytics such as evaluating the use and operation of our website so that we can continue to enhance the website and our services.
