Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personally identifiable information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to Us. Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that this may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities, creating or accessing an Account, or doing business with us if they do not provide the information that We need.

We may transfer information that we collect about You (and your End Users, in the case of business clients), including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Laws governing data collection and use may differ from those in force in your jurisdiction.

###  **Confidentiality and security**

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of Your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site.

We endeavour to safeguard and protect Users’ information. When Users submit personally identifiable information on the Site, their personally identifiable information is protected both online and offline.

Accounts are password-protected so that only You and JackMedia have access to this personal information. You may edit your registration data by using your password.

When our Account registration process requests Sensitive Information (such as bank account information and/or credit card information), and when we transmit such Sensitive Information, that Sensitive Information is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect Sensitive Information online, we protect all other user information online and offline. The Third Party Agent servers that we utilise to store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure physical environment. The Third Party Agent has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information stored on its servers.

Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data on or through our Site is at your own risk. However, access to your personally identifiable information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. Only employees, and Third Party Agents, that need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all User information. Employees not adhering to our written firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable laws, We shall notify You and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that We learn of an information security breach with respect to your personally identifiable information. Where possible, You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.

You acknowledge that you provide your personally identifiable information to us with knowledgeable consent and at your own risk.

  


###  **Data retention**

Subject to any mandatory obligations to delete data or to mandatory record-keeping requirements, your information may be retained by Us and in our Third Party Agent portal, server logs, databases and records indefinitely.

  


###  **Third party websites and trademarks**

The Site may contain links to third-party websites ("Third Party Websites"), such as websites of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors and licensors. Please be aware that We do not control and are not responsible the content or links that appear on Third Party Websites or for the privacy practices they employ. In addition, these Third Party Websites may be constantly changing.

Browsing and interaction on any Third Party Website, including websites which have a link from our Site, is subject to that Third Party Website's own terms and policies.

###  **Advertising**  
Ads appearing on our site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognise your computer each time they send You an online advertisement to compile non-personal identification information about You or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

  


###  **Google Adsense**

Some of the ads may be served by Google. Google's use of the Dynamic Advertising Reporting & Targeting (DART) cookie enables it to serve ads to Users based on their visit to our Site and other websites on the Internet. DART uses non-personally identifiable information and does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, etc. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy at <http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/>
