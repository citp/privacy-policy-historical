Our commitment to privacy   
    
Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.   
    
This policy has been prepared in accordance with Section 51 of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act No. 25 of 2002. We protect your personal information and only use and disclose your personal information in compliance with that Act.

The way we use information   
    
We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.   
    
You can register with our website if you would like to receive more information as well as updates on special inserts and competitions. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.   
    
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.   
    
We also use cookies to track users across our website and we compile statistical data. We are entitled by law to collect statistical data about website users and to create and trade with statistical profiles, but we ensure that the information disclosed in the statistical profiles cannot be linked to specific individuals.

Our Commitment To Children's Privacy   
    
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.   
    
Amendments to this policy   
    
We may amend this policy from time to time to have regard for changes in the law and in accordance with our requirements. We will post any updates and amendments on our website. It is important that you review this policy regularly so that you are aware of any amendments.   
    
Governing law
