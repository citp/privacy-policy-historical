	        e-mail address (which will help you when you forget your password and get all notifications for private messages on the site). On any page that collects personal information, we will 
	        specifically describe what information is required in order to provide you 
	        with the product or service or enter you in the promotion you have

	        we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information about you 
	        through the use of a cookie. The only way we would learn such information is 
	        if you specifically and voluntarily submit that information to us, for 
	        example, through a registration system, by entering a sweepstakes or 
	        promotion, etc.<br>
