# Earnings Disclaimer and Privacy Policy | James Clear

By visiting JamesClear.com, you are consenting to our privacy policy.

## **FTC Earnings Disclaimer**

In the interest of being FTC compliant and interesting at the same time…

You should assume that if you click on any link on JamesClear.com at any time, I will make tons of money. Probably millions of dollars, possibly more. At the very least, I'll get a solid gold bar with my name engraved on it. And if I'm not making cold hard cash from the links and products mentioned on this site, then you should assume that I am getting other major benefits: free flights in private jets, vacations on tropical islands, ten course meals with supermodels (sorry honey), a two–story chocolate fountain with a never–ending supply of strawberries, and other gifts that mere mortals can only dream about. And finally, if I mention any product or service of any type, just assume that I got a copy of said product or service for free and that this monetary relationship has completely altered everything that I have said about it.
