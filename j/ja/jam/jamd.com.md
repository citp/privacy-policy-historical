    Jamd is committed to protecting your privacy.  This privacy policy tells you about our online collection and use of data.  The terms of this policy apply to all Jamd websites, unless different terms are specified in a form or contract provided to you online or offline. 
    
    By using this site, you understand and agree to the terms of this policy.  This site is owned by Jamd, a division of Getty Images, and may be accessed in the United States and abroad.  Information collected may be stored, processed, accessed, and used in jurisdictions whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction.  
    
    **Collection of Your Personal Information**
    
    When you visit this site, certain kinds of information, such as the website that referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, and access times, may be collected automatically as part of the site’s operation.  We also may collect navigational information, including information about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the site. 
    
    We may combine your visit and navigational information with personal information that you provide.  You may always choose not to provide personal information, but if you so choose, certain products and services may not be available to you.  Personal information (e.g., your username and password, your name, your mailing address, email address, and phone number) is collected when you register.  Additional personal information (e.g., your credit card number and billing address) is collected to process transactions or to provide you with products and services. 
    
    Demographic information (e.g., your age, hobbies, income, gender, or interests) may also be collected and may be linked to your personal information. 
    
    **Use of Your Personal Information**
    
    Jamd collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve our sites, to process your transactions, to provide customer service, to perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies, and to display content that is customized to your interests and preferences.
    
    We also use your personal information to communicate with you.  We may send transaction-related communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, and purchase confirmations.  We may also send you surveys or marketing communications to inform you of new products or services, or other information that may be of interest.  If you do not wish to receive marketing communications, you may contact us as described below or follow the “unsubscribe” instructions included within each email communication.  Please keep in mind that, if you choose not to receive marketing communications, you will continue to receive transactional or account communications (e.g., confirmation emails and account balance statements).
    
    Personal information collected by Jamd may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Jamd or its affiliates maintain facilities, and by using our sites or services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.  Jamd abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.  If you would like to exercise any of your data protection rights (including the right to have your personal information deleted), please contact us using the “Contact Information” below. 
    
    
    **Sharing of Your Personal Information**

    We may share your personal information within our corporate group, including with our parent company and its subsidiaries and divisions, all of whom may use your information for the purposes disclosed herein.
    
    We may also share your personal information with service providers who perform services on our behalf.  For example, we may hire other companies to handle the processing of payments, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments, to assist in direct marketing, to conduct audits, etc.  Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service.  They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
    
    Information about our customers, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of the company and/or its assets, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.  We will notify you of such an occurrence as described in the “Changes to This Privacy Policy” section below.  
    
    We reserve the right to disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, employees, customers, or the public.
    
    **Accessing Your Personal Information**
    
    If you would like to review or revise information that you previously provided to us, you may e-mail us at [support@jamd.com](mailto:support@jamd.com).

    Jamd uses “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience.  A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive.

The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information, and your navigational and purchase history.

They allow us to identify registered users when they return to the site so that they can retrieve previous image search results, access Lightboxes and Clipbins and view their previous invoices.  Cookies also save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information.
    
    In some cases, our third-party service providers may use cookies on our sites.  We have no access to or control over these cookies.  This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Jamd only, and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
