YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS WEBSITE IF YOU ARE NOT OF LEGAL DRINKING AGE IN YOUR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE SIGNIFIES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT WHICH IS INCORPORATED INTO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

This site is operated by Irish Distillers Limited ("IDL", "We", "Our" or "Us"), a private company registered in Ireland with company number 23732 and having its registered office at Simmonscourt House, Simmonscourt Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, Ireland. Please contact Customer Services at 1850 774748 with any concerns you might have in relation to this site.

## GENERAL STATEMENT

IDL is committed to ensuring your privacy as a customer. IDL does not sell or exchange names, or any other personal information about our online customers with third parties and appropriate safeguards have been put in place to protect any personal information we may collect. IDL is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other websites.

## COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

When you visit www.jamesonwhiskey.com we may collect and process the following information:

  * details of your visits to the Site including, but not limited to, technical information about your visit (e.g. traffic data, location data, your IP address, the previous website from which you reached us and the type of browser you use);
  * your name and contact details, if you submit these to us;
  * details of any transactions you carry out through our Site [and the fulfillment of any orders]; and
  * information that you provide to us by, for example, filling in forms on our website; and if you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence.



This Site also uses cookies to remember your visits, to collect non-personal information from you (such as demographics, technical information or online behavior) and to serve targeted advertisements to you (as described below). You can disable cookies [with no loss of functionality] by following the appropriate instructions for your browser. We will only use information collected as described in this Privacy Statement, including to improve your overall experience at www.jamesonwhiskey.com or to respond to a request [or order] received from you and do so on the basis of your consent to this Privacy Statement and the Terms and Conditions.

In an effort to offer you the best - and most current - membership opportunities, we may contact you with news about IDL discounts, promotions and events. When you give us your details we will ask you if you would like to receive such information. Any information will only be sent to you when you have indicated consent to receiving such information.

## DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may disclose your information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries. We may disclose your information to third parties if we sell or buy any business or if IDL or its assets are acquired by a third party. We may also disclose your data to a third party if we are under a duty to do so in order to comply with any legal obligation, in order to enforce the Terms and Conditions for this Site or to protect the rights, property or safety of IDL, its customers or others.

## INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING

The cookies placed by the Site on your device, as described above, may be used to serve you with targeted advertisements when you visit other websites not controlled by IDL based upon interests exhibited from your online behavior. For example, if your online behavior (such as websites you have visited) indicates that you have an interest in music, we may serve advertisements to you specifically when you visit music websites. Another example could be your location – if we determine through the collection of non-personal information that you are located in a particular State, then we may serve advertisements to you that specifically promote offers or events in that State. The goal is to provide you with more relevant advertisements as you surf the Internet based upon your anonymous profile, but not based upon your personal information. However, if you would prefer that we not collect such data or use such data to serve you with targeted advertisements, then you should adjust the browser settings on your device to reject (or delete) our cookie. If you do take this step, we may still serve you with advertisements on other websites, but they will not be based upon behavioral data collected as a result of your use of this Site. This process relies upon cookies and not your personal identity, so if you use a different computer or change your settings, you will need to repeat this process.

We do not respond to or honor "do not track" (or DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers. To learn more about how you can exercise choices about the collection and use of certain data online for purposes of targeted advertising, please visit <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers>.

## YOUR RIGHTS

You are entitled to know what personal information we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. You may ask also us to update or remove your information by contacting Customer Services at 1850 774748.

When making such a request, please provide any personal identifiers which you have previously supplied on the Site (e.g. your name and email address). In certain circumstances you may have the right to request that data supplied by you is deleted. To exercise this right it may be necessary for you to identify a contravention of data protection law by IDL. All requests will be dealt with promptly and efficiently.

## CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT

This Privacy Statement policy may change as the website develops in order to take advantage of technological developments. We therefore encourage users to read the Terms and Conditions and to check this Privacy Statement on a regular basis.
