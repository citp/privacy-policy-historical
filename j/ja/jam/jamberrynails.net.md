Jamberry Nails, LLC. Privacy Policy Notice
Introduction
Jamberry Nails, LLC., a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah, U.S.A.,
(referred to herein as "Jamberry Nails," "we," "us" and "our") understands the importance of
privacy of individuals (referred to as "users" and "you"). This privacy notice outlines the personal
information Jamberry Nails may collect and how Jamberry Nails will use and disclose that
information.
Information Collection
Jamberry Nails may collect two different types of information, Personally Identifiable
Information and Non‐Personally Identifiable Information. "Personally Identifiable Information"
("PII") is information that identifies you as an individual ‐ for example, your name, address,
telephone number, email address, credit card information, billing address and shipping
information. "Non‐Personally Identifiable Information" ("Non‐PII") is aggregated information,
demographic information, IP addresses, user behavior data from web interaction metrics tools
and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.
In connection with our Independent Consultant enrollment process, Jamberry Nails may collect
PII about you that may be considered sensitive.
Jamberry Nails may also collect PII about you from, among other places: information you
provide directly to us, information regarding the services that Jamberry Nails currently provides
or has previously provided to you, information Jamberry Nails receives from our affiliated
entities or third parties relating to the establishment of our relationship or the provision of
services to you.
                                                   1


This information can be received in any manner, including in‐person discussions, telephone
conversations, and electronic or other written communications.
Information Use
Jamberry Nails may collect PII about you to establish or maintain our relationship with you,
respond to your inquiries, provide you with services you have requested, keep you informed of
services we think may be of interest to you, personalize your experience with us, and other
reasons.
Without PII, Jamberry Nails may be unable to provide you with the services you have requested.
Disclosure of Information
Jamberry Nails does not sell or lease PII about you to others.
Jamberry Nails may share PII about you with others as permitted by contractual agreement or as
required by law, such as our affiliates, third parties in connection with the provision of services
to you, government entities and regulatory bodies, and those with whom you have requested us
to share information.
Jamberry Nails requires third parties who perform services for us to agree to treat PII about you
confidentially and securely.
Unless restricted by law, regulation, contract or professional standards, Jamberry Nails may
transfer PII about you outside of the United States to other countries for the purposes described
in this privacy notice.
                                                   2


Jamberry Nails will not share PII about you with an unaffiliated third party who is not performing
services for us without first obtaining your permission, except if such sharing is otherwise
permitted by this privacy notice.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this notice or the Terms and Conditions of Use to the
contrary, we reserve the right to disclose and use your PII if we believe that we are required to
do so: (a) by law; (b) in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a
subpoena; (c) in response to a law enforcement agency's request; (d) to enforce our other
terms, conditions, or policies; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect the rights, privacy,
safety or property of Jamberry Nails, you or others; and/or (g) to permit us to pursue available
remedies or limit the damages we may sustain. For example, we may to the fullest extent the
law allows, disclose PII about you to law enforcement agencies to assist them in identifying
individuals who have been or may be engaged in unlawful activities.
Because Non‐PII does not personally identify you, we reserve the right to use Non‐PII, and to
disclose Non‐PII to third parties, for any purpose.
NOTE THAT THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OR POLICIES OF
THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING Jamberry Nails INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS. However, Jamberry
Nails Independent Consultants agree, as specified in our Policies and Procedures, to comply with
all applicable privacy laws and regulations.
Access
You may request access to the PII that Jamberry Nails has about you. You may also request the
correction, amendment or deletion of PII about you that is inaccurate. Jamberry Nails will treat
requests for access, correction, amendment or deletion of PII about you in accordance with its
internal policies and applicable legal requirements.
                                                   3


Information Security
Jamberry Nails maintains reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect
PII from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Our
personnel and the personnel of our affiliates are provided access to PII about you only if they
have a need to know the information in connection with a legitimate business purpose, such as
(a) the provision of services to you or (b) to help identify other services that Jamberry Nails and
its affiliates offer that may be of interest or use to you.
Changes to This Privacy Notice
Jamberry Nails reserves the right to change this privacy notice. Any changes to this notice will
become effective upon posting of the revised notice on the Internet or as required by law.
