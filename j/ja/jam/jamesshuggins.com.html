<p>On Wednesday, 26.Jul.2000, Senators Spence Abraham, John McCain and John Kerry introduced the Consumer Internet Privacy enhancement Act (CIPEA). This proposed legislation 
never made it into the law. But I used the law as a model to construct a privacy 
statement which <em><strong>would</strong></em> comply. I did it as an exercise in learning more about 
privacy principles.</p>
<p>I have created a 
<a href="cipea-tone.htm" title="Click here to open my special page regarding COPPA notices that I call COPPA Cabana." target="_blank">
CIPEAprivacy disclosure page</a> (which I call <a href="cipea-tone.htm" title="Click here to open my special page regarding COPPA notices that I call COPPA Cabana." target="_blank">CIPEATone</a>) to clarify the

<strong>
History of the Privacy Principles</strong>
</font></p>
<p>In 1972, elliot L. Richardson, as Secretary of HeW (the U.S. Department of 
Health education and Welfare), created an Advisory Committee on Automated 
Personal Data Systems. Their charter was to explore the impact of computerized 
record keeping on individuals. One year later (1973) the committee published its 
report. This report,
<i>
<a target="_blank" href="http://aspe.os.dhhs.gov/datacncl/1973privacy/tocprefacemembers.htm">Records, Computers, and the Rights of Citizens</a>
</i>, proposed a
<a target="_blank" href="http://aspe.os.dhhs.gov/datacncl/1973privacy/Summary.htm">
Code of Fair Information Practice</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>There must be no personal data record keeping systems whose very 
	existence is secret. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>There must be a way for an individual to find out what information about 
	him is in a record and how it is used. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>There must be a way for an individual to prevent information about him 
	that was obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for 
	other purposes without his consent. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>There must be a way for an individual to correct or amend a record of 
	identifiable information about him. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Any organization creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records 
	of identifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for 
	their intended use and must take precautions to prevent misuse of the data.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>These principles began a basis for subsequent codes and laws 
related to information collection. </p>
<p>The principles became part of the framework for the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.usdoj.gov/foia/privstat.htm">Privacy Act of 1974</a>. 
They were elaborated on when the Privacy Protection Study Commission (PPSC) 
published its report <i>
<a target="_blank" href="../pri1/ppsc-fair-information-practices.htm">Personal Privacy in an Information Age</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>In 1980, The Organization for economic Cooperation and Development further 
refined them in <i>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uhoh.org/oecd-privacy-personal-data.htm">
Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data</a>.
</i>
</p>
<p>They also form a basis of the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/eudirective/EU_Directive_.html">eU Privacy Directive</a>. </p>
<p>And, you can see them discussed in
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm">Part 
III</a> of the 1998 Federal Trade Commission report:
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/">Privacy Online</a>. </p>
<p>They continue today to be advocated and incorporated into enforcement initiatives, laws and legislative proposals.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Notice</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>People are entitled to notice of the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The notice should include:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>who is doing the collecting,</li>
<li>what data is being collected,</li>
<li>how it will be used,</li>
<li>to whom it may be disclosed, and</li>
<li>the consequences of refusing to give the information</li>
</ul>
<p>The notice should also address the other principles of choice, access, security and enforcement.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Choice</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>People should have choices about how their information is used or disclosed to third parties. Choice may be "opt in" in which people affirmatively consent to the use or disclosure. Or the choice may be "opt out" in which the consent is presumed unless people object. "Opt in" provides strong privacy protection because it establishes a default rule against disclosure and use.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that the choice is about use and disclosure beyond the original purpose for which the information was provided. Use and disclosure to complete a purchase transaction is, of course, required. However, such use and disclosure should be the minimum required to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Access</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>People should have access to information stored about them, together with the opportunity to correct the information or to have it deleted.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Security</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Operators should protect the security of personal data and ensure its integrity and accuracy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">enforcement</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>Of course, none of these make any difference if if the principles are not enforceable.</p>
<p>How to enforce is at the heart of a gigantic debate including proposals for self-regulation and counter-proposals for additional federal legislation.</p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">
<strong>Privacy Principles On This Site</strong>
</font></p>
<p>The five principles are important to this site. I take them seriously.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Notice</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>I provide complete (some say <i>too complete</i>) disclosure on this page. In addition, on my <a href="coppa-cabana.htm" title="Click here to open my special page regarding COPPA notices that I call COPPA Cabana." target="_blank">COPPA Cabana</a> page I disclose information specific to children and privacy. And on my <a href="cipea-tone.htm" title="Click here to open my special page regarding COPPA notices that I call COPPA Cabana." target="_blank">CIPEATone</a> page, I disclose this same information in a format more suitable to understanding that proposed law.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Choice</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>I give people choices. No one needs to disclose personal information if they don't want to. Except for the obvious (like not receiving an email from me if you don't give me your email address) there are no consequences of nondisclosure. You do not need to disclose information to surf my site. All disclosure is "opt in".</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Access</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>I provide people access to information stored about them, together with the opportunity to correct the information or to have it deleted.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Security</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>I protect the security of personal data and ensure its integrity and accuracy.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">enforcement</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>I consider this agreement to be enforceable between us. I even provide alternative organizations to notify if you think I'm not holding up my end of the bargain.</p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">
<strong>Who Operates This Site?</strong>
</font></p>
<p>I do, James S. Huggins. Just me. No one else. At the bottom of this page I have listed my address and phone numbers.</p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">
<strong>Minimal Information</strong>
</font></p>
<p>For activities related to this site, I only use the absolute minimum information required.</p>
<p>For example, when you join one of my email/ezine lists (e.g., <i>
<a href="../sni1/snippets.htm" target="_blank">Snippets</a>
</i> and <a target="_blank" href="../tez1/testzine.htm">TestZine</a>), list I keep your email address (because it really wouldn't make much sense to have an email list if I didn't keep your email address). And I keep information necessary to provide an audit trail in order to comply with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spamlaws.com/federal/108s877.html">CAN-SPAM Act of 2003</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you write me, I'll use your email address to write you back. (duh!)</p>
<p>As another example, when you click around my site, my server log files record how you clicked around. But the information doesn't tell me who you are, only that someone went from one page to another. And I only use that information to analyze traffic and don't keep it or use it beyond that.</p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">
<strong>Sharing Information</strong>
</font></p>
<p>I don't share information. I keep any information you disclose absolutely private. This does not apply of course to the Guestbook. Information disclosed there is shared with the whole world. But that is the whole point of a Guestbook, isn't it.</p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">
<strong>Unsolicited email</strong>
</font></p>
<p>Spammers are the scum of the earth. I will never give away, sell or disclose your email address.</p>
<p>I never email you just because you visited my site because I won't have your email address. I only email you because you explicitly ask me to (e.g., to respond to a request or because you explicitly asked to join one of my email/ezine lists (e.g., <i>
<a href="../sni1/snippets.htm" target="_blank">Snippets</a>
</i> and <a target="_blank" href="../tez1/testzine.htm">TestZine</a>), or to thank you for signing my guestbook.)</p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">
<strong>Taping Our Phone Conversations</strong>
</font></p>
<p>I am your friend.&nbsp; I am a real friend, not a Linda Tripp friend. I promise not to tape our phone conversations without telling you.</p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">
<strong>Policy Changes</strong>
</font></p>
<p>I'm committed to privacy. I won't arbitrarily change these policies. I can't even envision changing these policies at all.</p>
<p>But if I ever do change these policies, the changes won't be "retroactive". The changes will <i>only</i> apply to new information.</p>
<p>Your info is safe. Period. End of story.</p>
<p>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">
<b>Information Collected</b>
</font></p>
<p>I collect information in four ways:</p>
<ul type="square">
<li>My webserver,<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>My email/ezine lists (e.g., <i>
<a href="../sni1/snippets.htm" target="_blank">Snippets</a>

&nbsp;</li>
<li>This site's <a href="guestbook.htm">Guestbook</a>, and<br>

<li>Anything you disclose in an email to me</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't collect anything else.</p>
<p>I don't have any "real" registration forms for you to fill out.</p>

<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Use of Webserver Information</font>
</strong>
</p>
<p>When you click around my site, my server log files record how you clicked around. But the information doesn't tell me who you are, only that someone went from one page to another. And I only use that information to analyze traffic and don't keep it or use it beyond that.</p>
<p>Also, you can block that information using a tool like <a href="../oth1/adsubtract_pro.htm">AdSubtract</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't send that information, there are no consequences. I do not require disclosure of that information to browse my site.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Use of email/ezine List Information</font>

</p>
<p>My email/ezine lists are is compiled through requests to me.&nbsp;I only use this information to email email/ezine lists (e.g., <i>

</i> and <a target="_blank" href="../tez1/testzine.htm">TestZine</a>).</p>
<p>If you don't give me your email address, I won't be able to email you. But there are no other consequences. I do not require disclosure of that information to browse my site.</p>

<strong>

</p>
<p>If you leave me your email address, I will send you a thank you email for signing my Guestbook. If you leave me your website URL, I might visit your site. If you tell me how to win the lottery, I might try your technique.</p>
<p>But, I won't put you on an email list or sell my Guestbook information. (Of course, anyone who wants my Guestbook information can get it directly off the Guestbook without asking!)</p>
<p>If you don't sign my Guestbook, the whole world won't see your personal information. But there are no other consequences. I do not require disclosure of that information to browse my site.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3">Use of email Information</font>

</p>
<p>If you write me an email, I'll use the information in that email to write you back. Unless you ask me to, I won't put you on an email list. And I won't chare that information with other people.</p>
<p>If you don't write me an email, nothing bad happens. There are no other consequences. I do not require disclosure of that information to browse my site.</p>

<p>This site contains links to other sites. Unfortunately, I can't do much about the privacy practices of such websites. So you all be careful out there.</p>
<p>When you link through my site to other sites (e.g., Amazon.com) your browser may tell the other site that you came from one of my pages. This is called <i>referrer information</i>.</p>
<p>Now, I don't actually send that information; your browser does. But you should know that it is possible for you to block this information. To find out how, see my information on the tool <a href="../oth1/adsubtract_pro.htm">AdSubtract</a>.</p>
