### Privacy Policy

JamBase is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information.

### Consumer Information

During the process of delivering our website (www.jambase.com), JamBase does not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, JamBase may obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the your browser type or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). The information collected by JamBase is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers.

In some cases on JamBase and our subsidiary pages and sites (JamBase Festivals, JamBase Tickets, MyJamBase), you may voluntarily provide personal information either during registration or in response to a promotion that JamBase runs (a promotion may ask you to fill out a survey or provide your address or zip code for mailing prizes). If this does occur, JamBase may collect this information. JamBase may combine this information with other users' information and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of ad or visit a particular kind of website. From time to time JamBase will run its own surveys in order to better understand its audience demographic. This information may be shared in aggregate form with advertisers, never individually.

### Cookies

Cookies are not required in order to access JamBase, but JamBase does use cookies to help make your JamBase experience more personalized and helpful to your individual needs. JamBase may set a cookie on your machine when you visit www.jambase.com. Cookies are mainly used to recognize users and grant access to the My JamBase area of www.jambase.com. Cookies are also used to remember users who select this "remember me" option when logging in to My JamBase.

### Legal Compliance

Notwithstanding anything else stated in this Privacy Policy, JamBase reserves the right to disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal process, (2) respond to any claims against it, or (3) protect the rights, property or personal safety of JamBase, our customers or the public. Otherwise, we have total respect for your privacy.
