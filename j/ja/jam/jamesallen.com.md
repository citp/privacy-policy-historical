Thank you for visiting JamesAllen.com. James Allen respects your privacy and we understand and share your concern about the privacy of your personal information. This notice describes our privacy policies. By visiting JamesAllen.com, you are confirming your agreement to the privacy policies described in this Privacy Policy.  


## Information we collect

We collect and store any information that you may enter on any of our web sites or provide to us in some other way. For example, when you place an order and/or sign-up for email communications and updates, we collect and store personal information so that we may provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested. Such information may include your name, address, age, date of birth, gender, education level, email address, telephone and fax numbers, credit card information and information about your interests and activities. You can choose not to provide certain types of information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our web site(s). We may also collect and store information about other people that you provide to us. For example, you may submit a person's name and address if you wish us to ship a product as a gift to a friend.

We may also automatically collect and store certain types of non-personally identifiable information whenever you visit any of our web pages. For example, like most commercial shopping web sites, we use "cookies" and we obtain certain types of information whenever your web browser accesses any James Allen web site. Such information may include the type of web browser you are using, the operating system of your computer and the domain name of your internet service provider. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but allow you to disable them. We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better shopping experience. Utilities are available from third parties to help you visit web sites anonymously, but use of such utilities may also prevent us from providing you with the best shopping experience at JamesAllen.com.

## Use of information

All personal information that we collect from our customers is used to improve our relevance to you and to improve your shopping experience with us. We use the information that you provide so that we may provide the products and services that you have ordered or requested. In addition, we may send you (via email or other means) offerings of products or services which we think may be of interest to you or we may ask you to participate in activities such as special surveys. At any time, you can choose to no longer receive any non-transactional emails from JamesAllen by accessing http//www.jamesallen.com/remove and entering the email address to which the email was originally addressed. You may also unsubscribe from other campaigns that you have previously opted to receive by following the instructions on the bottom of the specific campaign.  


We will not share the personal information which you provide to us except (i) for the purposes that you provided it to us, (ii) with your prior consent, (iii) as may be required by law as we reasonably deem necessary to protect James Allen or others from injury or loss, or (iv) with other persons or entities with whom we contract to provide services in connection with our web site(s) or other business activities. If we do share such personal information with a third party, we will, to the extent practical, require that the recipient protect that information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. However, we cannot guarantee how such a third party will use personal information.  


We sometimes use non-personally identifiable, summary or aggregate information that we collect to improve the design and content of our web sites(s) and to enable us to further enhance your shopping experience with James Allen. We may also share such aggregate information with third parties for that purpose.  


The personal information which you provide to James Allen is an asset of the company and may be included in the assets transferred to an acquirer if James Allen is acquired by a third party. In the event of such a transfer, any personal information transferred shall remain subject to the terms and promises contained in this Privacy Policy.  


## Security

We believe that James Allen has in place appropriate procedures to protect the security of personal information transmitted to us or by us. We have designed our web site(s) to encrypt such information during transmission using Secure Sockets Layer software.

## Access to correction

James Allen gives you access to the personal information that we have collected about you and the ability to correct any errors in such information. For instructions on how to access and/or make corrections to your personal information please contact our offices at 1-877-826-9866.

## Children's privacy

Our web sites(s) are not directed toward children and James Allen does not sell products for purchase by children. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of eighteen.

## Terms of use, notices and revisions

If you visit any James Allen web site, your visit and any dispute concerning privacy will be subject to this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use. Our business continues to develop and evolve and this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use will accordingly change from time to time.
