We are committed to protecting and maintaining the privacy of your information, and will process your data only in accordance with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy.

We will have a lawful basis for processing your data if:

  * We need to process your information in order to provide you with the products or service you have requested (e.g., to fulfil an order; process a request by you; process a hint);
  * Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you;
  * You have consented to such processing;
  * We have a legitimate interest for processing your data – e.g., for fraud prevention; network and information systems security; to provide the Website and ensure it functions properly; data analytics; enhancing modifying or improving our services; fulfil an order; identifying usage trends; determining the effectiveness of promotional campaigns; and/or
  * We are legally obliged to process it.



## 3\. how we protect and store your information

 _Security_. We have implemented appropriate technical, organizational and security measures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned. However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers. Nevertheless, we make commercially reasonable efforts to make the collection and security of such information consistent with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws and regulations. As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer, device or network you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your user IDs and passwords, please make sure to take appropriate measures to protect this information.

 _Retention of your Personal Data_. In addition to the retention periods mentioned in Section 1 above, in some circumstances we may store your Personal Data for longer periods of time, for example (i) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements, or (ii) for us to have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or (iii) if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your Personal Data or dealings.

## 4\. How We May Share Your Information

In addition to the recipients described in Section 1, we may share your information as follows:

  *  **Affiliates:** We may share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries for business, operational, promotional, and/or marketing purposes;
  *  **Our Service Providers:** We may share your information with our third party service providers that provide business, professional or technical support functions for us (including to the extent necessary or desirable to fulfill or ship your order or complete your transaction; provide customer support; process your purchases), help us operate our business and the Website, or administer activities on our behalf
  *  **Select Third Parties:** With our joint marketing partners for the purposes described in this Policy, including when we believe such partners may have offers of interest to you;
  *  **Legal Matters; Safety:** We may share your information to the extent necessary, with regulators, to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules, and requests of law enforcement, regulatory and other governmental agencies or if required to do so by court order. We also may disclose your information to protect the security of our Site, servers, network systems, and databases, including for fraud prevention purposes. We also may disclose your information as necessary, if we believe that there has been a violation of our Terms of Use, any other legal document or contract related to our services, or the rights of any third party.
  *  **Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets:** If, in the future, we sell or transfer some or all of our business or assets to a third party, we will (to the minimum extent required) disclose information to a potential or actual third party purchaser of our business or assets. In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Data in connection with the foregoing events.
  *  **With Your Consent:** Where you have provided your consent to us sharing the Personal Data (e.g., where you provide us with any marketing consents or opt-in to optional additional services or functionality, if required by applicable law).
  *  **Aggregate or Anonymous Non-Personal Information:** We may share aggregate, anonymous, or de-identified non-personal data with third parties for their marketing or analytics uses.



## 5\. additional information regarding transfers of personal information

Access from Israel is covered by the adequacy decision issued by the European Commission. Access from the US is covered by our privacy shield registration.

We ensure transfers within the James Allen group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the James Allen group (an intra-group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that Personal Data receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred to.

Where we transfer your Personal Data outside of EU/EEA, for example to third parties who help provide our products and services, we will obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your Personal Data. Some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes like the EU - US Privacy Shield for the protection of Personal Data transferred from within the EU to the United States.

Where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any Personal Data is disclosed.
