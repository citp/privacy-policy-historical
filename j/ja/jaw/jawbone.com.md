This Statement does not cover any other information that we collect including, without limitation, data that we collect offline or that we receive through our mobile app and store from users of our fitness tracker products.

**Server Locations.**  
We are headquartered in San Francisco. We host our servers and process information in the United States and other countries. When you access our Sites, you transmit information to the United States and other countries.

This type of information is collected to make our products and services more useful to you. In some of our emails to you, we will use a "click-through URL" to make your experience as easy as possible. When you click on one of these URLs, our web server detects that you clicked on the link from your email before arriving at your destination website. Tracking click-throughs helps us determine your interest in particular topics and helps us measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire when you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of the site may not work properly.

_Combinations:_ We may combine information we receive through the Site with information we receive about you from other sources, for example, our mobile apps and fitness tracker devices.
