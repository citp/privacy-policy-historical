The Site is not intended for, or designed to attract, children under the age of 13; it is also not intended, or designed, to collect personal information from children.  If a parent or guardian has reason to believe that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, the parent or guardian should contact us at [customer.service@jasonsdeli.com](mailto:customer.service@jasonsdeli.com).   

  1. **Information We May Collect from You**


  1. _Information You Provide:_   From time to time, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, location, local Jason’s Deli restaurant, payment information, and other comparable information.  Providing this information will always be voluntary, and your information will always be used for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.
  2. _Internet Protocol (IP) Address & Location Information:_  When you use the Site, we may passively collect (that is, gather without you actively providing the information) your IP address and the location from which you are visiting the Site.  We may aggregate this information with similar information provided by other users to produce analytics regarding the number of users visiting a site from a particular location, for instance, or to sort your search results by the restaurant closest to you.  The data we collect will never contain, or be combined with, information that identifies you personally without your permission.
  3. _Other Passive Information Collection:_   We and/or our service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and technology providers may use session and persistent cookies, web beacons, clear gifs, session IDs, successor tracker technology and other similar technologies as you navigate the Site and material displayed thereon.  “Cookies,” for instance, are small text files placed on your Internet browser in order to perform functions like tracking your preferences and selections as you navigate the Site, showing you advertisements based on your interests, or gathering information about the technology you are using to access the Site.  We passively collect this information to understand what areas of the Site are most popular, which areas may require improvement and what technologies are being used by our visitors.  This information helps us and the aforementioned third parties to update and improve the Site and otherwise manage and measure the performance of content, promotions, advertisements and other features displayed or delivered on or through the Site.  We also use this information for security purposes, to detect and to block security breaches and to provide you with a safe online environment.  Many web browsers will allow you to disable or block cookies and other similar technologies, but please note that doing so may prevent you from using certain parts or features of the Site, or prevent the Site from working properly for you.
  4. _Information from Other Sources:_   From time to time, we may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you.  We may also use third-party information to supplement, or verify the accuracy of, information already contained in our records. The Site may also contain functionality which enables you to import profile information or contacts from third party services, including social media services (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Google+, FourSquare, Instagram, Vine, etc.).  Any data maintained by such third-party service and your use of that third-party service will be subject to that third party’s terms of use and privacy policy.  You may have the ability to post information from the Site to your third-party accounts.  All such postings are also subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of the applicable third parties as well as the terms of this Privacy Policy.
  5. _Mobile Location Services_ : The Mobile Applications may also include location functionality that relies upon collection of geo-location data from your mobile device (e.g., to identify nearby Jason’s Deli locations).  Your mobile device may include settings to disable the Mobile Application’s access to your location.  Please check your device and/or operating system instructions for availability and details.  Note, however, that opting out of the Mobile Application’s collection of location information will cause its location-based features to be disabled.

  2. in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, assignment or other transfer of the Company or the business of the Site to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes;

We work hard to protect the integrity of the information collected in our databases.  We use both technical and procedural methods to maintain the integrity and security of our databases, including the use of encryption and limited access to data.  But you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.  PLEASE NOTE:  The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  Never share your password with anyone else, notify us promptly if you believe your password security has been breached, and remember to log off of the Site before you leave your computer or mobile device.
