# Jasmine Directory: Submission Guidelines and Privacy Policy

### Simon says...Submission Guidelines

  * In order to keep Jasmine Directory as useful, friendly and safe as possible, we prefer to play safe.



##### Website suggestion related FAQ and guidelines:

  * **Why is Jasmine Directory different?**

The main purpose of Jasmine Directory is to create a user-friendly environment, with a high editorial discretion applied to each and every suggested website, created for those who seek information. We believe this should be the primary motivation for any web directory.

Contrary to the general belief, a web directory should not be just another website allowing a website owner getting a backlink. Such directories violate Google's Guidelines. 

  * **What websites do we add to Jasmine Directory?**

Our editors are adding on a daily basis new listings to our database. Furthermore, other webmasters are allowed to suggest websites to be added to Jasmine Directory by paying a fee, and, if our editors consider that resource useful for others, they'll accept it.

There is a huge difference between "suggesting" a website to a website directory (because a suggestion is subject to approval or rejection) and "a guaranteed listing".

  * **Why can't I suggest websites for free?**

The Internet is huge; there are billions of websites, hundreds of thousands of online businesses. People are mindful about SEO, they read everywhere they need backlinks, they see various metrics like Page Authority or Domain Authority as a divine blessing they must have and so forth.

Basically, a free web directory is spammed with suggestions. DMOZ for example had over 90.000 editors and the review process took years.

So, collecting a modest review fee ensures the quality of our services (hosting and marketing, paying our editors, adding new content and tools etc.) and on the other hand limits the number of suggestions and indirectly reduces web spam.

  * **What kind of websites are added to Jasmine Directory?**

Our primary focus is oriented towards to provide an excellent user experience. Therefore we prefer sites filled with unique information, have decent layout etc.

Before approving a resource (website) we visit that website and decide whether or not that resource (product or service) is useful for users.

  * **What kind of websites are usually rejected?**

Well, it is difficult to name the exact websites we reject. However, we don't accept pharmacy websites (because most of them run illegally), affiliate-only based websites (they don't offer anything unique), redirected websites, websites that sell stolen software, websites which legitimacy is foggy etc.

  * **How should I suggest my website?**

You just need to select a category or subcategory that best describes your website's niche and make use of the "Submit" top menu link.

  * **Can I use whatever website title I want?**

No. We are all fed up with directories listing twenty "Best SEO Company" Guaranteed Results | Click here!!!" in a SEO related category. That is called spam.

Instead, use the official name of your website. We love it, Google loves it!

  * **Okay, what about the description?**

A website's description should not be promotional and shouldn't urge the user to click or buy or call. Also try not to use superlatives like "best", "leading" etc. We want impartiality and objectivity so the user can solely decide where to click. Just imagine a home improvement category filled with ten or twenty "best" businesses offering the same service.

Instead, describe what your website has to offer, what a user can find on your website, specify if you serve only a specific region and so forth.

  * **Why have you edited my listing?**

Making Jasmine Directory a useful resource requires us to exercise a high level of editorial discretion. So, in some cases we may modify the title or the description of the suggested website and/or move it to a more appropriate category.

  * **What's your refund policy?**

We do not offer refunds if the submitter is not pleased with the newly assigned category or the modified title and/or description.

We do not offer refunds after a listing was reviewed, accepted and included in Jasmine Directory.

Submitters should understand that the review fee represents literary just a review fee and not some kind of guarantee or promise.

However, to keep things fair, we refund the review fee if your website will be rejected.

For any active discount codes we reserve the right to refund the discount after 90 days to avoid chargebacks.

  * **Do you remove broken links, parked or dropped domains, suspicious redirects?**

Every 2-3 months we run an entire audit of all our external resources. We don't want to offer our users a bad user experience, so every resource that isn't back online in a resonable time frame will be deleted from Jasmine Directory's database
