<br>
Jaspersoft is committed to protecting your personal information and respecting your privacy. Our goal is to give you as much control and information as possible regarding your personal data and the use we make of it in the course of our business. We want to be a leader in providing comprehensive privacy information to our customers. In general, you can visit Jaspersoft Web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.<br>
<br>
In order for us to provide you with quality support and service, it is necessary to provide limited personal information when using our support and information request forms. We assure that Jaspersoft will never sell, rent, or disclose your personal information to outside parties without your consent unless compelled by law or court order to do so. With your permission, Jaspersoft may send you e-mail regarding our new products, upgrades, or select third-party products. We do not disclose your personal information to third-parties.<br>
What Information We Gather and Track<br>
There are times when we may need to collect information from you through our Web site. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a Jaspersoft or third party product from our Web site. When you download the Jaspersoft PDF files and other product information, we may require you to fill out a form with your name and e-mail address.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Jaspersoft uses various methods to collect certain other kinds of information, including:<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(242, 152, 12);">Cookies<br>
Referrers<br>
IP addresses <br>
System information</span><br>
<br>
None of these methods can be personally identified with you with the exception of cookies, which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Website, as described below. <br>
<br>
A "cookie" is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. It can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience. Some Jaspersoft pages use cookies. Cookies are used to better personalize the content, banners and promotions that you and other users will see. We may use the information to research and understand how our users' habits in the aggregate are similar or different so that we can enhance your experience on Jaspersoft sites and with our products. With your consent, cookies can optionally store information from forms that you fill out on our site so that next time you visit, you do not have to re-enter this information. For example, this would allow you to enter your zip code so that next time you visit, you can automatically see local content from your area. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Jaspersoft does not require that you accept cookies.<br>
<br>
Jaspersoft software may use Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) to notify us of the installation of one of Jaspersoft's products.<br>
<br>
A "referrer" is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically gathered by our Web server. This information is used by Jaspersoft to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.<br>
<br>
IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. They are automatically gathered by our Web server. Jaspersoft will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information.<br>
<br>
System information we gather includes time, type of Web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your Web browser when you are connected to a Web site and is used by Jaspersoft only for broad demographic statistics. This information is used by Jaspersoft in identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.<br>
What We Do With the Information We Gather and Track<br>
<br>
The personal information gathered from the forms you fill out on our Web site is used in one of three ways:<br>
<br>
1. to provide you with information about products, services, news and events;<br>
2. to allow you to download products;<br>
3. to gather broad demographic information about user trends.<br>
<br>
Jaspersoft, at times, must disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors so they may provide specific services for Jaspersoft. Jaspersoft requires such contractors to keep your information strictly confidential and to use the information solely on behalf of Jaspersoft. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, such contractors are not considered "third-parties" and Jaspersoft may disclose personal information to such contractors without additional notice.</span></span></span></p>
